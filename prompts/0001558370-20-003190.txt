 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 On March 16, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into us, with us continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the time the merger is effective, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) (other than Excluded Shares (as defined below) and Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) will be converted into the right to receive 2.5 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent (“Parent Common Stock”). Each share of Common Stock that is held by the Company as treasury stock or that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, or any subsidiary of the Company (collectively, “Excluded Shares”), immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) will cease to be outstanding and will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.  “Dissenting Shares” are shares of the Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares of the Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions to closing, including, among others: (1) requisite approvals of our and Assertio’s stockholders; (2) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Merger; (3) the approval of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as consideration in the Merger for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, (4) effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 registering the shares of Parent Common Stock and other equity instruments to be issued in the Merger, (5) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations, warranties and compliance with the covenants of each party to the Merger Agreement, and (6) Assertio, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries having minimum cash and cash equivalents equal to $25 million in the aggregate (as calculated pursuant to the Merger Agreement).  We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to consummate the merger in the second calendar quarter of 2020.

We are a commercial-stage life science company committed to bringing differentiated products to patients and healthcare providers. We are focused on marketing our portfolio of medicines used both in and outside of the hospital by orthopedic surgeons, gynecologists, neurologists, internists, gastroenterologists, physiatrists, rheumatologists and podiatrists. Our six commercially available products include: SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray, ZORVOLEX® (diclofenac), INDOCIN® (indomethacin) suppositories, VIVLODEX® (meloxicam), INDOCIN oral suspension and OXAYDO® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only —CII.  VIVLODEX and ZORVOLEX are SOLUMATRIX® Technology non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products. In November 2019, we divested assets related to TIVORBEX® (indomethacin), which was a SoluMatrix product, to a third party, although we continue to supply TIVORBEX tablets to that third party. In January 2020, we divested TIVORBEX to a third party and amended the terms of the license agreement with iCeutica (as defined below). To leverage our commercial infrastructure and augment our current product portfolio, we continually seek to acquire additional late-stage product candidates or approved products to develop and/or commercialize. 

On January 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of five marketed non-narcotic, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (“NSAID”) products from Iroko (the “Iroko Acquisition”).  To facilitate this transaction and reorganize our capital structure, in January 2019, we completed proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware. In exchange for the products, Iroko received among other consideration, $45.0 million in principal amount of our 13% senior secured notes and shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized Company representing in the aggregate approximately 49% of outstanding common stock at issuance, subject to dilution for shares of common stock issued pursuant to our stock-based incentive compensation plan.  Pursuant to the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, holders of our then outstanding convertible notes received shares of common stock of the reorganized Company, and holders of our then outstanding senior secured notes received in the aggregate of $20.0 million in cash, $50.0 million in principal amount of our 13% senior secured notes, as well as shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of the reorganized Company representing, in the aggregate, approximately 19.38% of outstanding common stock at issuance, subject to dilution for shares of common stock issued pursuant to our stock-based incentive compensation plan.

 Strategy

Our goal is to bring differentiated products to patients and become a leading commercial company with whom companies seek to partner. We are focused on commercializing our own products and identifying additional business development opportunities that we believe could accelerate our growth. Key elements of our strategy include:
· | Driving revenue growth from all six of our marketed products and extending the life cycle of our products. We support our products through a combination of personal and non-personal promotion. With our dedicated salesforce throughout the United States, we are targeting a range of therapeutic areas and healthcare providers to build awareness, educate and increase adoption of our products. We are considering new ways to extend the commercial life span of each of our products through a variety of activities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creating best-in-class commercial organization that we can leverage for business development activities to build on our product portfolio. Over the years, we have created a commercial organization built around bringing our differentiated medicines to patients with minimal inconvenience and increased accessibility. By working to become a best-in-class organization, we believe we can attract other companies to partner with us. We are seeking to leverage our commercial excellence to grow through partnering and in-licensing and/or acquisition of late-stage and commercial products. We are seeking products and late-stage product candidates that would be appropriate for physicians who we are already educating about our other products and can scale based on our capacity to support additional commercial launches and partnerships. We are actively involved in multiple therapeutic specialties and are seeking products across these therapeutic areas to commercialize.

  Market Opportunity for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) 

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a group of drugs used to temporarily relieve pain and inflammation. They work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, or chemicals believed to be associated with pain and inflammation. A variety of issues can result in pain and inflammation including arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, menstrual cramps, headaches, dental procedures, infection and fever. This is not an exhaustive list, but demonstrates the breadth of conditions that can require a medication to relieve symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that the first line of therapy for pain and inflammation should be non-opioid treatments, such as NSAIDs. According to a JAMA Network Open 2019 article, NSAIDs are among the most widely prescribed medications, with 70 million prescriptions written annually in the United States.  Because of the range of conditions for which NSAIDs can be used, the types of physicians who prescribe them are similarly broad. 
 Our Products 
 SPRIX Nasal Spray

SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray is an NSAID indicated in adult patients for the short-term (up to five days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. This non-narcotic provides patients with moderate to moderately severe short-term pain a form of ketorolac that is absorbed rapidly but does not require an injection administered by a healthcare provider (“HCP”). A range of specialists prescribe SPRIX for various uses. Urologists, podiatrists and orthopedic surgeons, neurologists, women’s health providers and other specialists may use SPRIX Nasal Spray for post-surgery acute-pain management. 

Formulated as a nasal spray, SPRIX Nasal Spray is rapidly absorbed through the nasal mucosa, achieving peak blood levels as fast as an intramuscular injection of ketorolac. SPRIX Nasal Spray has been studied in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain. SPRIX Nasal Spray has demonstrated a 26% to 34% reduction in morphine use by patients over a 48-hour period in a post-operative setting as compared with placebo. We acquired SPRIX Nasal Spray 

 
  4
 
and certain related assets from Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Luitpold”) in January 2015 for $7.0 million. SPRIX Nasal Spray is currently sold in the United States and the first commercial sale of SPRIX Nasal Spray occurred in May 2011. 
 SoluMatrix® Technology NSAID Products
  The SoluMatrix technology platform is used in the three products we acquired from Iroko, one of which we subsequently divested. This technology was developed in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) support of using the lowest NSAID dose possible. SoluMatrix uses a dry milling process to reduce the NSAID drug particle size by at least ten times. The smaller particle size results in increased surface area relative to mass, which increases the dissolution and absorption rates without changing the chemical structures of the drug molecules themselves. Because of this altered absorption profile, the SoluMatrix NSAID products dissolve and are absorbed at a rate that allows for the rapid onset of pain relief at lower doses and lower systemic exposures than other NSAIDs. 

ZORVOLEX is a novel formulation of diclofenac developed using the SoluMatrix technology platform providing patients 23% lower overall systemic exposure versus other forms of diclofenac. This low-dose diclofenac is approved for mild to moderate acute pain and osteoarthritis pain. 

VIVLODEX is a SoluMatrix formulation of meloxicam approved for osteoarthritis pain. VIVLODEX is dosed once daily and offers patients low dose and low systemic exposure. 
 INDOCIN Products

We acquired two forms of INDOCIN (indomethacin), an oral solution and a suppository, from Iroko in January 2019. Both products are approved for many indications including: moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease, moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis. 
 OXAYDO, an abuse-discouraging IR oxycodone product.

OXAYDO is an approved IR oxycodone product designed using an aversion technology to discourage abuse via snorting. It is indicated for the management of acute and chronic pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. OXAYDO is covered by six U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2025. Patents covering OXAYDO in foreign jurisdictions expire in 2024. We are looking for a partner for this product.   
 U.S. Commercialization Strategy

Our goal is to identify differentiated medicines that we can deliver with limited inconvenience for healthcare providers and increased accessibility for patients. To support the sale of our six approved products, we use both personal and non-personal promotional approaches. In connection with the acquisition and license of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO respectively, we built a fully scaled commercial organization focused on educating providers. Our sales representatives in almost 90 territories are promoting our products to healthcare providers in the United States in a variety of specialties including orthopedics, podiatry, neurology, gastroenterology, women’s health, physiatry, rheumatology and internal medicine. We continue to seek avenues to improve the efficiencies and impact of our commercial organization. We believe that our targeted sales force execution, proper brand positioning, message delivery and education, as well as our focus on ensuring proper product access for patients who require our medicines, will help us to achieve our promotional goals.  Business Development
  Our products have been acquired or licensed through business development activities. We continue to seek additional late-stage product candidates or approved products that we can add to our portfolio of medicines. We are seeking products that our sales force could promote to the specialists who we are currently targeting for our current 

 
  5
 
products. We are considering products that are used in and outside of the hospital. We also are considering products that are in specialty areas outside of current targets, but would require minimal additional resources and could leverage our current commercial infrastructure.  
 Global Partnerships

As part of the Iroko Acquisition, we acquired rights with respect to six international distribution arrangements with companies seeking to register and market ZORVOLEX and VIVLODEX in their respective territories. Four of those distribution partners have secured registration of ZORVOLEX in nine territories and of VIVLODEX in one territory. We have maintained three of those international distribution relationships.  Product Candidates and Proprietary Guardian Technology Platform

While our current focus is on our commercial products, we have product candidates at various stages of development that were developed using our proprietary Guardian technology. We do not plan to advance these product candidates unless we are able to identify a partner to assist us. 

Our proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet technology that utilizes a novel application of the well-established manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that are structurally hard and difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. While our Guardian Technology creates a tablet that is extremely hard and has AD features, the construct of the tablet allows for controlled release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in the gastrointestinal tract. This approach offers the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation. We received FDA approval for ARYMO ER (extended release morphine), which was manufactured with Guardian Technology, and has been shown to have increased resistance to physical methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking using a variety of mechanical and electrical tools and received an AD label (we subsequently discontinued this product in 2018). The tablets are also resistant to chemical manipulation and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid, making the ability to dispense them through a syringe difficult.
 Manufacturing
 Our approved products are manufactured at contract manufacturing facilities in the United States. We have agreements with Catalent Pharma Solutions (“Catalent”) to manufacture and Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Patheon”) to package ZORVOLEX capsules, Neolpharma, Inc. to manufacture and package VIVLODEX capsules, Patheon to manufacture INDOCIN oral suspension, Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to supply INDOCIN suppositories and Jubilant HollisterStier LLC (“JHS”) to manufacture SPRIX Nasal Spray.  Sharp provides our packaging for SPRIX, which we purchase through purchase orders. We have an agreement with UPM Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to produce OXAYDO.  Catalent also manufactures TIVORBEX capsules, which we supply to another company.   Drug Substances
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) used in SPRIX Nasal Spray is ketorolac tromethamine, in OXAYDO is oxycodone hydrochloride, ZORVOLEX is diclofenac and VIVLODEX is meloxicam. Both INDOCIN oral suspension and suppositories, as well as TIVORBEX all use indomethacin as the API. We currently procure these APIs on a purchase order basis, some of which are pursuant to an agreement with one of our suppliers. We acquire ketorolac tromethamine and indomethacin from a European-based manufacturers, diclofenac and meloxicam from Indian-based manufacturers, while we secure oxycodone hydrochloride from a U.S.-based manufacturer.
 Oxycodone hydrochloride is classified as narcotic controlled substance under U.S. federal law and, as such, OXAYDO is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Schedule II controlled substances are classified as having the highest potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of OXAYDO are subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “Governmental Regulation—DEA Regulation.”

 Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own as critical to our success and competitive position. 

In connection with the Iroko Acquisition, we entered into a license agreement with iCeutica Inc. and iCeutica Pty Ltd. (collectively, “iCeutica”), which we amended in January 2020. We exclusively license 19 U.S. patents from iCeutica, all of which cover iCeutica’s SoluMatrix® technology and relate to composition of matter, process of manufacturing or method of use of two of our marketed products, VIVLODEX and ZORVOLEX, as well as TIVORBEX, which we sublicense to another company. Three of the U.S. patents that cover VIVLODEX are listed patents under the Approved Drug Products and Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication, or Orange Book, seven of the U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover ZORVOLEX and another three of the U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover TIVORBEX. The remaining U.S. patents relate to the SoluMatrix technology. There are nine pending patent applications in the United States relating to the SoluMatrix technology and the three products. These patents expire between 2030 and 2035. Prior to Iroko Acquisition, Iroko settled patent infringement litigation with Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Lupin”), which settlement will allow Lupin to launch a generic form of ZORVOLEX prior to the expiration of the patents covering ZORVOLEX, no later than the second half of 2023.

Both Lupin and Novitium Pharma submitted an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of VIVLODEX. The notices from Lupin and Novitium Pharma included a “Paragraph IV certification” with respect to the Orange Book VIVLODEX patents alleging that these patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by the commercial manufacture, use or sale of Lupin and Novitium Pharma’s proposed generic product. iCeutica and Iroko sued both Lupin and Novitium over their ANDAs for a generic version of VIVLODEX.  Both of the cases were settled.  Lupin can launch an authorized generic of VIVLODEX and Novitium can launch a generic form of VIVLODEX no later than the first half of 2022.

In addition, we license seven U.S. patents and five foreign patents from Acura Pharmaceuticals, all of which cover Acura’s Aversion Technology and relate to the composition of matter. Six of the seven U.S. patents are Orange Book listed patents that cover OXAYDO. These patents expire between 2023 and 2025. In addition, we license one U.S. patent application relating to OXAYDO and Acura’s Aversion Technology, which relate to the composition of matter. 

We own two U.S. patents that expire in 2029 and two pending U.S. patent applications, directed to processes of manufacture, devices, and compositions, related to SPRIX Nasal Spray. We held an exclusive license from Recordati SpA Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company (“Recordati”) to a U.S. patent listed in the Orange Book covering SPRIX Nasal Spray which patent expired in December 2018. We are aware that there is the possibility of generic entrants and if those generic products were to come to market, there could be a material impact on our revenues. We have been exploring ways to extend the life of our SPRIX Nasal Spray patents.  

We own 21 issued patents within the United States, covering our product candidates incorporating our Guardian technology platform. The term of our overall domestic patent portfolio related to ARYMO ER, Egalet-002 and our Guardian Technology platform, excluding possible patent extensions, extends to various dates between 2022 and 2033.
 Competition

We face competition and potential competition from several sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies and drug delivery companies. Oral NSAIDs such as celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam and naproxen are the major competitors for our NSAID products. The key competitive factors in this market are product effectiveness, product safety profile, brand awareness and managed care access. Our main competitors are BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.,  Flexion Therapeutics, Inc., Horizon Pharmaceuticals,  Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. and various generic companies.

We had expected that OXAYDO would compete with ROXYBOND, an ADF, IR oxycodone developed by Inspirion, but its commercial partner Daiichi Sankyo (“Daiichi”) has not launched it. Based on this development, the other AD formulations that had been in development, may also not be moved forward. OXAYDO may face competition 

 
  7
 
from non-opioid product candidates including new chemical entities (“NCEs”), as well as alternative delivery forms of NSAIDs. These new opioid and non-opioid product candidates are being developed by companies such as Acura, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hospira, Inc., Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, Intellipharmaceutics International Inc., Nektar Therapeutics and QRxPharma Ltd.
 Government Regulation

FDA Approval Process
     In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA delay or refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”) or other marketing applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA approval process can be time consuming and cost intensive and companies may, and often do, re-evaluate the path of a particular product or product candidate at different points in the approval and post-approval process, even deciding, in some cases, to discontinue development of a product candidate or take a product off the market.
 Pharmaceutical product development in the United States for a new product or changes to an approved product typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing, along with other information that is known about an investigational drug product,  are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Longer-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans, unless the FDA authorizes that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin sooner than 30 days after submission. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin, as long as other necessary approvals (for example, an institutional review board (“IRB”) overseeing clinical study sites) have been granted.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers and/or to patients with a targeted disease or health condition under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal law; (ii) in conformance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), which are international standards that elaborate expectations and actions to protect the rights and health of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, service providers (such as clinical research organizations), administrators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the specific objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated and recorded. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for 

 
  8
 
subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, concerns about subjects, or may impose other conditions. Sponsors have ongoing submission and reporting obligations to FDA and IRBs, and FDA and IRBs may exercise continuing oversight of a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-to-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Another scenario which allows for a single Phase 3 efficacy/safety study is via the 505(b)(2) pathway when the investigational product is not bioequivalent to the RLD but can still rely on other safety data from the reference product for a submission.
 After completion of the necessary clinical testing, an NDA or other form of application for marketing authorization is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the detailed results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, proposed labeling, certain patent information, and other specified information. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2.9 million for FDA’s fiscal year 2020 (October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020), and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees, currently $345,424 per product in FDA’s fiscal year 2020. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening condition. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider major amendments to pending NDAs or for other reasons. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee— typically a panel that includes non-FDA clinicians and other experts— for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but takes into consideration the recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with applicable law and GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the indication described in the product labeling.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the existing deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, 

 
  9
 
those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months, depending on how the resubmission is classified (i.e. by the type and complexity of the information being evaluated). 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential serious risks. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post approval testing and surveillance to monitor or further understand the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or if problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including most changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Post Approval Requirements 
 Ongoing adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs and NDA specifications after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and obtain licenses from certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and training and compliance effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory authorities may require remediation, withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems or new concerns are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution may be pursued. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”)
 The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) of 1987 and the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 govern the storage, handling, and distribution of prescription drug samples. The law prohibits the sale, purchase, or trade (including an offer to sell, purchase or trade) of prescription drug samples; it also imposes various requirements upon manufacturers, including but not limited to, proper storage of samples, documentation of request and receipt of samples, validation of a requesting practitioner’s professional licensure, periodic inventory and reconciliation of samples, notification to the FDA of loss or theft of samples, and procedures for auditing sampling activity.  Some similar state laws apply. In addition, section 6004 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) also requires manufacturers to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that were requested and distributed to licensed HCPs in a given year.     The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product, active ingredient, or method of use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the 

 
  10
 
listed patents covering the approved drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form, with essentially the same labeling as the listed drug, and that has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under an ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and often can or are required to be substituted by pharmacists fulfilling prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify or make certain representations to the FDA concerning any patents currently listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) no relevant patent information has been filed, (ii) a listed patent has expired, (iii) a listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (iv) a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the marketing of the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method‑of‑use. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the applicability of the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced NDA product have expired.
 A certification that the ANDA product will not infringe the already approved NDA product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”) drug product, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by the FD in another NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA can neither receive nor review any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug, nor any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. Although NCE exclusivity runs for five years, an ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires, if one or more patents are listed for the NCE product in the Orange Book and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submits a Paragraph IV certification. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug for which new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) are required, commonly for the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation. During a three-year exclusivity period, the FDA can review, but cannot approve, an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the exclusivity-protected conditions. The FDA can approve an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) in the meantime for other conditions not protected by exclusivity.
 Additional types of exclusivity may be available, depending on the circumstances. For example, orphan drug seven-year exclusivity is available in connection with the approval of drugs for rare diseases. Pediatric exclusivity provides a six-month extension of the protections of  patents and other exclusivities, if requested studies in children are performed.

 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide a path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired or a Paragraph IV certification has been made and either 30 months have passed or there has been settlement of the lawsuit or decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.  Approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA also can be delayed until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity, and pediatric exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes appropriate reports of new clinical studies and other criteria are satisfied.
 REMS
 The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, commonly called a REMS, to ensure the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to support the safe use of the drug, such as laboratory test monitoring or patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 In July 2012, the FDA approved a standardized REMS for all ER and long-acting (LA) opioid drug products. ER formulations of morphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone, among other opioids, are required to have a REMS.  This includes ARYMO ER. In September 2017, the FDA issued letters to manufacturers of IR opioid drug products announcing the agency’s intention to require a REMS for IR formulations as well, and requirements were implemented in 2018.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register certain clinical trials and disclose trial-related information including certain results. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as 

 
  12
 
part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to post the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for a period of time when a new product or new indication is being studied. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the existence and progress of development programs.
 DEA Regulation
 Our product, OXAYDO— and our product candidate— Egalet‑002, if approved, will be regulated as a “controlled substance,” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”), which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through an intended closed chain of distribution. In addition to DEA, state-controlled substance agencies and boards of pharmacy apply comparable requirements under state laws. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, accountability controls, security measures, and other controls in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Controlled substance registrants must monitor for and report suspicious orders, as well as thefts and significant losses of controlled substances.
 The CSA and DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances, by definition, have no recognized medicinal use in the U.S., and may not be marketed or sold in the United States, although research may be performed. An approved pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and associated harm, and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse and associated harm among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:

· | high potential for abuse;
--+--------------------------


· | currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

  OXAYDO, an IR oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA and we expect that Egalet‑002, an AD, ER oxycodone product candidate, if partnered and approved, will be as well. Other companies’ oxycodone products have been subject to recent scrutiny, litigation, and concerns. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms. Any of our products regulated as Schedule II controlled substances will be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much morphine and oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate number of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. Our company (and our license partners and contract manufacturers (CMOs)) receives an annual quota from the DEA that enables us to produce or procure specific quantities of Schedule I 

 
  13
 
or Schedule II substances, including oxycodone hydrochloride for use in manufacturing Egalet‑002 and OXAYDO. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments. The quotas we are provided for specific active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our license partners and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Many foreign countries are also signatories to the internal drug control treaties and have implemented regulations of controlled substances like those in the United States. Our products will be subject to such regulation which may impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements and restrict sales of these products in those countries.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations for marketing exclusively in one member state may be submitted as well as for marketing in more than one member state. Such marketing authorization for several member states may be submitted under a centralized, a decentralized, or a mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for simultaneous national marketing authorizations in more than one member state. Where a national marketing authorization has already been granted, the holder of a national marketing authorization may apply to the remaining member states for mutual recognition of the marketing authorization. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If there is disagreement as to whether approval should be recognized, the matter is discussed and decided by all concerned member states. If the concerned member states cannot reach an agreement, then the matter is considered by the European Commission, and, in such a case, the national marketing authorizations must be consistent with the Commission’s decision.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement, marketing, and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General “OIG”), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers’ activities (including sales and marketing activities, as well as scientific/educational grant programs, among other activities) are subject to fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Typically, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. These activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce another to (i) refer an individual for the furnishing of a pharmaceutical product for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid (“covered product”); (ii) purchase or order any covered product; (iii) arrange for the purchase or order of a covered product; or (iv) recommend a covered product. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to a wide range of arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and others, including, but not limited to, any exchange of remuneration between a manufacturer and prescribers (such as physicians), purchasers, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), formulary managers, group purchasing organizations, hospitals, clinics and other health care providers, and patients. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and rebates, “value-added” services, the furnishing of supplies or equipment at no charge, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce referrals, prescribing, purchasing, or recommending covered products may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Additionally, many states have adopted laws like the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply, in at least some cases, to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor— not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs— and do not contain safe harbors.  Violations of fraud and abuse laws such as the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Our arrangements and practices may not, in every case, meet all criteria for applicable exceptions and/or safe harbors for the Anti‑Kickback Statute, and thus would not be immune from prosecution under the Statute. Additionally, Anti‑Kickback Statute and similar state laws are subject to differing interpretations and may contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Finally, some of the safe harbor rules are currently under review for potential revision.  Given these variables, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar authorities.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor, not merely a federal healthcare program. 
 There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability based on inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, 

 
  15
 
improperly reported government pricing metrics, such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off‑label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
 We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement about the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, our marketing activities may be limited by data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established standards for “covered entities,” which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, regarding the security and privacy of protected health information. While we are not a covered entity under HIPAA, many of our customers are, and this limits the information they can share with us. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) expanded the applicability of HIPAA’s privacy, security, and breach notification standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security and breach standards (and certain privacy standards) directly applicable to “business associates,” which are entities that perform certain services on behalf of covered entities involving the exchange of protected health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. While we do not currently perform any services that would render us a business associate under HIPAA/HITECH, it is possible that we may provide such services in the future and would be subject to the applicable provisions of HIPAA/HITECH. Finally, we are likely to be directly subject to state privacy and security laws, regulations and other authorities— specifically including the California Consumer Privacy Act— which may limit our ability to use and disclose identifiable information, and may impose requirements related to safeguarding such information, as well as reporting on breaches.
 Additionally, the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, requires that manufacturers of prescription drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to HHS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to U.S. “physicians” (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and “teaching hospitals.” The Open Payments program also requires that manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to HHS ownership and investment interests held in them by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers’ reports are filed annually with the CMS by March 31, covering the previous calendar year. CMS posts disclosed information on a publicly available website annually by June 30. 
 There are also an increasing number of state laws that regulate or restrict pharmaceutical manufacturers’ interactions with health care providers licensed in the respective states.  Beyond prohibiting the provision of certain payments or items of value, these state laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to, among other things, establish comprehensive compliance programs, adopt marketing codes of conduct, file periodic reports with state authorities regarding sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and register/license their sales representatives. A number of state laws require manufacturers to file reports regarding payments and items of value provided to health care providers (similar to the federal Open Payments program). Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. Given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their 

 
  16
 
implementation, despite our best efforts to act in full compliance, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties— including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑ marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations— any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. With respect to any of our products sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable privacy laws and post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs, and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Impact of Public Pressure on Drug Pricing, Healthcare Reform and Legislation Impacting Payor Coverage
     The pricing and reimbursement of our pharmaceutical products is partially dependent on government regulation. Zyla must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, including: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part B Program and Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Programs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule Program, and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s 340B Drug Pricing Program. Zyla must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B Program. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose Zyla to penalties.   
     In the United States, federal and state government healthcare programs and private third-party payors routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products.  In the United States, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare, which may put additional pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing, and reimbursement and usage, and adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, including formulary coverage and positioning, laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies, and pricing in general.
     Efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products— including legislation on drug importation— could adversely affect our business if implemented.  Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, resulting in proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals, and drug pricing continues to be an agenda item at both the federal and state level.  
     For example, in 2018, the Trump administration released the Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs (the “Blueprint”).  Certain proposals in the Blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since its publication, could cause significant operational and reimbursement challenges for the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs so that they are more closely aligned with international drug prices. In 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget released a proposed rule submitted by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to remove Anti-Kickback Statute Discount Safe Harbor protections for drug rebates paid by manufacturers to insurance plans and PBMs for Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid, and to create new safe harbors, among other proposed changes. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which have generally focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.  Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges.  Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing and/or drug price transparency at the federal and/or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.   

 
  17
 

     The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (ACA). The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug medicines. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms— any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA. We continue to face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. 
     Any future healthcare reform efforts, including those related specifically to the ACA, and any that further limit coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, may adversely affect our business and financial results. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), amended, among other changes, the ACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D prescription drug plans (also known as the Medicare Part D “Donut Hole”), and increased the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent under current law to 70 percent. This 70 percent manufacturer discount also applies to 2020. The implementation of cost-containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
     Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
     The commercial success of our products and product candidates, if and when approved, is partially dependent on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from public (i.e., federal and state government) and private (i.e., commercial) payors. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy— either in whole or in part— if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors will continue to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms, and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
     As discussed above, the cost of pharmaceuticals  continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures, given the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional regulatory and legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies, as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
 Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost‑effective by third‑party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that the third‑party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all 

 
  18
 
transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Other Regulatory Requirements and Challenges to Regulatory Actions
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and other environmental and safety regulations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA or other responsible regulatory agency has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to issue adverse inspection findings and require corrective action, levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Companies may petition governmental agencies, including the FDA, to discuss or take action with regard to regulatory decisions made relating to a product, product candidate or the company itself.Employees

As of February 28, 2020, we have 127 employees, of which 126 are employed in the United States and one is employed in Denmark. Of our employees, 91 are in sales and marketing and 36 are in administration. Per the Danish Salaried Act, Danish employees have the right to be represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.  Available Information

The SEC maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Copies of our annual report on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10‑Q, current reports on Form 8‑K, ownership reports for insiders and any amendments to these reports filed with or furnished to the SEC are available free of charge through our internet website (www.zyla.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC. We use the Investor Relations section of our website as a means of disclosing material non‑public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.
 In addition, we make available free of charge on our internet website:
