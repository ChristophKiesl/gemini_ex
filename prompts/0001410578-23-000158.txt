ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Our Company
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “initial business combination”). Our Sponsor is DC Rainier SPV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”). While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on established, technology focused businesses that have an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $2.0 billion and would benefit from access to public markets and the operational and strategic expertise of our management team and board of directors. We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team in consummating an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive returns for our shareholders.
The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on October 4, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On October 7, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit including the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $172.5 million, and incurring transaction costs of approximately $12.3 million, consisting of $6.9 million of deferred underwriting fees, approximately $1.1 million of other offering costs, and approximately $4.3 million as a cost of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 596,200 Units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit (the “Private Placement”), to the Sponsor and our CEO and CFO, generating gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 million. Upon the closing of our IPO, approximately $176 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, and invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as otherwise permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Proposed Business Combination
On March 23, 2022, we entered into that certain Business Combination Agreement, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Business Combination Agreement, dated as of June 19, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among us, Hub Cyber Security (Israel) Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel (the “HUB Security”), and Rover Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of HUB Security (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us as the surviving corporation in the merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of HUB Security (the “HUB Business Combination”). Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended, and customary adjustments set forth therein, the aggregate consideration for the HUB Business Combination and related transactions is expected to be approximately $226,885,000 of equity consideration, as set forth in the Merger Agreement, which amount includes the funds in the Trust Account and PIPE Financing commitments. The Merger Agreement, as amended, provided that the outside date for the closing of the HUB Business Combination was January 22, 2023, which date was subsequently extended to February 28, 2023.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties thereto. The consummation of the proposed Merger is subject to certain conditions as further described in the Merger Agreement.
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, HUB Security entered into subscription agreements (the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors (the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Subscribers have agreed to subscribe for ordinary shares of HUB Security that will be issued in connection with the closing of the HUB Business Combination (the “PIPE Shares”), for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $50,000,000 at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, in a private placement (the equity financing under all Subscription Agreements, collectively, the “PIPE Financing”). The purpose of the PIPE Financing is to raise additional capital for use in connection with the HUB Business

Combination. The PIPE Shares will be identical to ordinary shares of HUB Security that will be issued to our existing stockholders at the time of the closing of the HUB Business Combination, except that the PIPE Shares will not be entitled to any redemption rights and will not be registered with the SEC. The closing of the sale of PIPE Shares will be contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the HUB Business Combination.
See the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 9, 2022, Supplement No. 1 to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on December 22, 2022 and Supplement No. 2 to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022 (as amended or supplemented, the “proxy statement/prospectus”), for additional information.
Extension and Redemptions
On December 21, 2022, we held a special meeting of stockholders, where the stockholders approved an amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from January 7, 2023 to March 1, 2023 and (ii) expand the methods that the Company may employ to not become subject to the “penny stock” rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment, the holders of 14,535,798 shares of common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.3003 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $149.7 million. As such, approximately 84.3% of the public shares were redeemed and approximately 15.7% of the public shares remain outstanding. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our Trust Account was approximately $28.5 million.
Business Combination Meeting
On January 4, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Merger Meeting”) to consider and vote upon, among other things, the HUB Business Combination and related matters. Each of the proposals presented at the Merger Meeting, as more fully described in the proxy statement/prospectus, was approved. The submission of the HUB Business Combination to the stockholders entitled holders of public shares to redeem their shares for their pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account. In connection with the Merger Meeting, as of February 21, 2023, we received requests for redemption from holders with respect to 2,580,436 public shares. These redemptions were in addition to the 14,535,798 shares of common stock that were tendered for redemption in connection with the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on December 21, 2022.
Our Management Team
Our management team is led by Matthew Kearney, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Young Cho, our Chief Financial Officer, who have extensive experience as private equity investors and as C-level executives in a variety of industries including media, financial institutions, and fintech.
Matthew Kearney, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, has over 30 years of experience as an investor, Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman, and Board member in mergers and acquisitions in the United States and United Kingdom in the areas of private equity, technology and wealth management. Mr. Kearney has previously been an investor and involved in leadership positions of a number of companies including a special purpose acquisition company. Matthew has an MBA from London Business School, a BSc (Hons) in Aeronautical Engineering from Manchester University, and C.Eng. (RAeS).
Young Cho, our Chief Financial Officer and director, has a wide range of experience in the banking and fintech industries. Most recently, Mr. Cho has served in CIO and CFO positions at a select group of early stage cryptocurrency companies. Before getting involved in crypto startups, Mr. Cho held several investment banking positions and was a co-founder and Managing Director at Newtonian Capital, a multi-strategy hedge fund focusing on event-driven strategies based in Hong Kong. Mr. Cho has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Cornell, a Masters in Financial Engineering from Cornell, and a MPA in Economic Policy Management from Columbia.
We believe we will greatly benefit from the experiences of our executive officers and directors as we seek to identify and consummate an initial business combination. Our team has extensive experience in the financial services sector as investors, managers, principals, advisors or directors of companies operating in the technology sector. They also have extensive experience in

identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies targeted for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the technology sector. Prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers and board, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities. While our management team does have experience pursuing an acquisition on behalf of a blank check company, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to locating a target business to acquire or any business combination we may consummate.
The past performance of the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team or any of its affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions.
Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. 
Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
