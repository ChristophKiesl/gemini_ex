Overview
Splunk provides innovative solutions that use data from digital systems to help organizations identify opportunities for optimization and innovation and to keep those systems secure and performing effectively. This class of data is growing significantly as a direct result of the prevalence and importance of digital systems used by today’s organizations. Decades of investment in digital transformation have integrated the hardware and software that comprise digital systems into every aspect of how modern organizations operate. The data generated by these systems contains a comprehensive, real-time record of operations, interactions, and transactions that our offerings convert into insights and actions that improve technology and business outcomes. Our solutions for cybersecurity (“Security”) and Observability empower users in technology roles, including Development Operations (“DevOps”), IT Operations (“ITOps”), and cyber security, to monitor and secure digital systems more quickly and efficiently. Business users leverage our offerings to gain visibility into their digital processes to deliver better experiences, improve decisions and drive better results.
Our offerings provide visibility to our customers’ diverse technology infrastructure including systems deployed on the edge, on premises, and in private and public cloud environments, running software ranging from monolithic apps to cloud native ones. We also believe our offerings empower operational transformation, helping customers move from reactive, non-scalable and ineffective approaches to proactive, automated, and AI-assisted processes that drive better outcomes even as the scale and complexity of their technology continue to grow.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased the importance of being a digital, data-driven organization and we believe the importance of data-driven innovation will only continue to increase over time. The events of 2020 and 2021 accelerated the adoption of new ways to work and exerted an enormous amount of pressure on organizations of all kinds to deliver better experiences and outcomes, and to enable entirely new offerings and business models. We believe this global shift in the business environment and the related challenges are here to stay and that Splunk enables organizations to rise to these challenges by leveraging technology to achieve greater efficiency, agility, security, and drive a sustained competitive advantage. When organizations use Splunk to improve their security postures and build resilience, they are able to innovate more effectively.

Our Growth Strategy
We are focused on providing the right capabilities through our products and services to remove the barriers between data and action. The key elements of our growth strategy are: 
Cloud-first Platform and Solutions. We have reached a key milestone in our cloud transformation, where cloud services represent the majority of our total cloud services and license bookings. Our cloud services customers have accelerated their time to value and achieved lower total cost of ownership. Most importantly, the rate at which new features and capabilities are delivered to and used by customers is accelerated when using cloud services offerings. Given our customers’ success adopting our cloud services offerings, we will continue to invest heavily in differentiated cloud services offerings delivered through a cloud-optimized go-to-market and support model. We will continue to invest in our license offerings to enable both standalone consumption and hybrid Splunk deployments that span customer on-premises and cloud environments. We expect our cloud services offerings will continue to be an important source of growth for Splunk, our customers and our partners.
Expand the Splunk value proposition with broader and deeper capabilities. We will continue to focus our product strategy and go-to-market approaches on our Security and Observability users and we will expand the Splunk platform and Splunk Solutions offerings that serve them. We intend to deliver new and enhanced capabilities, as well as services that provide faster time-to-value and easier adoption and expansion. We also plan to deliver new features tailored to meet the specific needs of users, including more comprehensive data reach, more powerful analytics, and AI/ML and automation capabilities. While we are focused on extending our industry analyst-recognized leadership across Security and Observability, our customers benefit from even greater value when multiple organizations are generating insight using the Splunk platform.
Global Expansion. We continue to invest in go-to-market, operations and infrastructure to deliver our services to customers in targeted countries across multiple geographies. Splunk has had success in global expansion as evidenced by our increased mix of revenues outside of the U.S. and we continue to see this as a significant growth opportunity.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our offerings, develop new end-market specific solutions and apps, conduct software and quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing offerings. As we shift our focus to cloud services offerings we will make significant investments in a cloud-optimized delivery model while continuing to invest in our license offerings, both for standalone consumption and for deployment in hybrid environments. 
Acquisitions and Investments
We enhance and expand our offerings both through our own research and development efforts and through acquisitions and investments. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that can accelerate the delivery of new capabilities, entry into new market segments and our technical expertise.
Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, internal policies and contractual provisions to protect our technology and intellectual property rights. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the jurisdiction in which such right arises. We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We file trademark, patent, and copyright applications to protect our intellectual property.
Generally, we retain ownership of software we develop. All software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code or as a cloud service pursuant to browser-wrap, embedded or on-line license or service terms, or signed customer agreements. These agreements generally contain restrictions on duplication, disclosure, reverse engineering, transfer and license circumvention. 
We use open source software in our offerings and business, including as incorporated into software we receive from third party commercial software vendors or technologies obtained through acquisitions, and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Additionally, we, including companies that we have acquired, have intentionally made certain proprietary software available on an open source basis, both by contributing modifications back to existing open source projects, and by making certain internally developed tools available pursuant to open source licenses, and we plan to continue to do so in the future. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to expand market awareness, generate sales pipeline, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth and enablement for adoption and customer success. 
Sales
We sell our offerings directly through field sales, inside sales and indirectly through different routes to market with a community of partners. These partners include leading, global service integrators, managed services partners, and resellers. We gather prospects through a broad range of marketing campaigns, programs and events. Our sales development teams handle lead qualifications. Large or complex transactions generally are handled by our globally distributed direct field sales teams. Our sales engineers help define customer use cases, pre-sales qualification and evaluation.
Our field sales teams are organized geographically across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). We also have a dedicated sales team focused on government customers, which includes United States federal, state and local government entities.
In addition to acquiring new customers, our sales teams are responsible for securing renewals of existing contracts, as well as increased adoption of our offerings by existing customers. To accomplish this, our field sales and customer success teams work closely with our customers to ensure adoption and overall account health, which fosters expanded usage through higher capacity or upgrades and additional use cases.
Marketing
We focus our marketing efforts on generating opportunities for our sales force and partners, increasing awareness of the Splunk brand, driving viral adoption, and communicating product advantages and business benefits. We market our offerings as a targeted solution for specific use cases and as an enterprise solution for a broad range of data and use cases. We engage with existing and potential customers to provide community-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our cloud services and license offerings within these customers. We engage business press, technology press, industry analysts and influential voices to create awareness for Splunk in our target markets. We host a number of events across our sales regions to engage with both existing customers and new prospects, as well as deliver product training. We host our annual user conference, “.conf” and multiple partner forums as other ways to support the Splunk community to foster collaboration and help our customers drive further business results from our offerings. 
Partner Network
Our prioritization of cloud services offerings presents an opportunity for Splunk partners to enhance their existing investments and future profitability by expanding their offerings to include services, support, and integration capabilities to accelerate customers’ digital transformations. Splunk’s ideal partner creates cloud solutions focused on customer outcomes and delivering effective, multi-dimensional solutions across industries and theaters. Partners can untap new markets, customers, and data streams with new product innovations. While not every innovation will deliver the same results, we believe establishing a culture of co-innovation that drives repeatability is foundational to making Splunk broadly available. As such, Splunk shifted the focus to partners that deliver value through selling, advising, building, and managing services to drive higher partner and customer adoption across our offerings. The new Splunk Partnerverse program anchors our partner strategy. Splunk Partnerverse builds on Splunk’s global brand, expands our customer base through partners, and reinforces Splunk as both cloud-ready and partner friendly. There are three program objectives:
•Serve all Splunk partners through one program that enables and promotes a cloud-first partner network
•Differentiate partners in the market through the Splunk Partnerverse badging system powered by enablement and training paths to demonstrate proof-points in competency
•Showcase Splunk partners’ validated expertise and their Splunk-based offerings via the Solutions Catalog so that customers can easily find the right partners
Splunk organized its partner strategy to align with all partner types with a focus on two partner-centric routes to market:
Cloud service providers (“CSP”) Strong partnerships with CSPs (e.g. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) are the cornerstone of our cloud focus. The online storefront known as a cloud marketplace offers customers an alternate way to conduct transactions. Today our Marketplace business is driven primarily by customer demand and we will meet our customers where and how they want to buy. We are coordinating product development, sales efforts, and ongoing marketing efforts with these key partners to promote Splunk Cloud running on CSP infrastructure.
Global systems integrators and managed services providers These partners support planning, implementation, and management of end-to-end business solutions tailored to specific customers, segments, and industry verticals. We focus on full stack market solutions that partners manage to ensure our customers have access to the best expertise, technology, and solutions for optimal performance, security, and technology operations.  We are working with this partner set to develop and deploy Splunk platform-based solutions to their customers, extending our overall market reach and total addressable market. We further intend to establish select core business groups to increase our joint selling opportunities, explore new solutions, and promote Splunk’s strength in Security and Observability.
Splunk Community Engagement
We engage with the community of Splunk users, including Splunk employees, partners, and customers, through a variety of online and in-person forums to assist with Splunk skills development. Additionally, our engagement with users empowers the development of Customer and Partner solutions, drives cross-pollination of experiences and best practices, and provides feedback on current and planned future offerings and capabilities. 
Our primary online forums include Splunk Answers, Splunk User Groups, and Splunk Ideas. In Splunk Answers, users share best practices about how to build searches, create data visualizations, build implementations to address specific use-cases and configure and deploy our cloud services and license offerings. While our product, support, engineering and professional services teams participate in Splunk Answers, the majority of questions appearing on Splunk Answers are answered by other Splunk users, including the SplunkTrust, a peer-nominated, MVP group of Splunk users. Splunk Ideas is a forum through which the community can submit and vote on ideas for new product offerings and capabilities, providing a highly-refined set of inputs to our product development efforts. We also maintain active communities on leading social internet platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Slack. 
Comprehensive enablement for Customer and Partner solutions developers is provided on our Splunk Dev portal. Splunk Dev contains resources for building apps, integrations, and other Customer and Partner solutions content that extends 
the Splunk offerings to new data, insights, and use cases. Developers can sign up for free licenses or access to support both their on-premises and cloud-native application needs. Additional resources made available through Splunk Dev include developer guides, API references, tutorials, downloads, tools and examples to help developers efficiently create new solutions. 
We also continue to support the growth of the Splunk Community, with local Splunk User Groups around the world and a growing collection of Splunk-sponsored events, such as .conf, and regional/local events.
Customers
As of January 31, 2022 we have customers in more than 130 countries and our offerings have been deployed by over 95 of the Fortune 100 companies. We provide offerings to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, educational institutions and government entities. Our current customer base spans numerous industry verticals, including education, financial services, government, healthcare/pharmaceuticals, industrials/manufacturing, media/entertainment, retail/ecommerce, technology, and telecommunications. Please refer to Note 9 “Revenues, Accounts Receivables, Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations” of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our customers and concentration of revenue and receivables.
Competition
Our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive with an increasing number of vendors competing across product areas. For example, security vendors are attempting to penetrate the observability industry, observability competitors are targeting the security space, competitors across the security and observability siloes are expanding their footprints in log management and machine data space, and CSPs are extending their native operations and security capabilities across competing cloud environments. Additionally, a number of more domain-focused competitors continue to target specific use cases within the application, IT and security domains in an attempt to drive rapid penetration.
These dynamics position us in competition with a variety of large CSPs and software vendors, as well as smaller specialized companies, open source projects and custom development efforts, which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include: 
•Cloud monitoring and APM/Observability vendors;
•Monitoring, troubleshooting, security and analytics services offered (embedded or add-ons) by major public CSPs;
•Companies targeting the data analytics industry;
•Legacy security, systems management and other IT vendors; and
•IT departments that undertake custom software development efforts to analyze and manage their operations data across their public and private cloud landscapes. 
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Three high-level environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives—advancing our Global Impact Strategy; integrating ESG across the business; and innovating through our climate strategy—form the tactics for maturing and extending our ESG work. Our board of directors works closely with management to oversee ESG, with each of our three board committees dedicated to areas of the program associated with their respective areas of responsibility.
In fiscal 2022, we formally launched our four-pillared Global Impact Strategy that focuses on these areas: Social Impact, Ethical and Inclusive Growth, Data Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability. By leveraging our technology, expertise and talent, we strive to add unique value, drive collaboration, embrace our stakeholders and innovate for impact—four principles that guide our Global Impact Strategy. Through our strategy, we aim to bridge the data divide to find actionable solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges and to amplify positive social and environmental impacts in service to humanity. We also published our inaugural Global Impact Report, shared our ESG Position Statement, and released our Bridging the Data Divide: Mobilizing data and the tech ecosystem for everyone white paper and World Economic Forum blog article. Additionally, we announced a suite of science-based climate targets and commitments that aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as verified by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in a manner consistent with a 1.5°C 
ambition level, and we shared our plan to register a second suite of shorter-term five, ten, and fifteen year targets with the SBTi by the end of fiscal 2023.
Human Capital
Human capital management is foundational to the Ethical and Inclusive Growth pillar of our Global Impact Strategy. At the core of Splunk, we are a people-centric company. We believe that the best way to continue to deliver customer success and the best products and services is to focus on attracting the most qualified candidates to join our team (based on skills, knowledge and abilities). We also spend time and energy supporting, retaining and developing our high-performing and innovative employees. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is central to our core values. We strive to embrace each person’s unique individual value and the communities that matter to them. This commitment is an integral part of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”) strategy. As of January 31, 2022, we employed over 7,000 employees, of which approximately 71% were in the United States and 29% were in our international locations. 
We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
A diverse and inclusive company helps us achieve our mission of bringing data to every question, decision and action to drive positive outcomes for our company, our communities and each other. Our company-wide inclusiveness effort, A Million Data Points, speaks powerfully to our holistic, multi-dimensional approach to diversity, illuminating cultural heritage, intersectionality, experiences and all the unique qualities and talents that each employee possesses. We also cultivate an inclusive culture through several employee resource groups (ERGs). Splunk is focused on the hiring, retention and representation rates of women and individuals from underrepresented groups. We provide DEI education and offerings to imbed inclusion and equity in our talent processes. We plan to conduct intersectional employee surveys that look at a combination of factors that include underrepresented groups and gender to check for variances in employee experiences. Furthermore, to oversee the impact DEI has within Splunk, we have a dedicated DEI at Splunk Council (DISCO) composed of leaders from each function. This team is focused on influencing our DEI strategy, with specific areas of focus around hiring, promotion, retention and attrition, as well as connecting DEI activities to a broader business-driven, results-oriented strategy. We also have an Inclusion Council which plays a pivotal role in embedding engagement, equity, inclusion and belonging within everyday practices, as well as in sharing best and next practices across the enterprise.
We work to help provide access to new careers in technology with skills development and training, promoting a new generation of diverse talent through a global network of universities, community colleges and workforce partners like YearUp and Hire Military. Splunk is regularly recognized as an employer of choice in the technology industry and within the various locations that we operate. In fiscal 2022, Fortune named Splunk one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For, as well as one of the top 10 Best Workplaces in Technology, and a Best Workplace for Parents and Millennials. In addition, we were named one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality for the second year in a row, after earning a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Corporate Equality Index, and named by People magazine as one of the top Companies That Care. In fiscal 2021, we were included in Fortune’s Best Workplaces for Women, Parents and Millennials.
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found in the Diversity Annual Report posted on our website.
Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing
Splunk provides a comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits package to attract, retain and engage the talented employees that make our company successful. We provide employees with competitive base salaries, incentive compensation and equity awards in the form of RSUs as well as the opportunity to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows employees to purchase Splunk stock at a discount.
Our benefits offerings are designed to meet the unique needs of our employees. We believe we provide competitive benefits in each local market we operate in to help our employees care for themselves and their families. Common offerings are health benefits, retirement benefits, fertility and family planning benefits, paid time off, holidays and leave benefits.
In response to COVID-19, we offer a number of additional benefits to help our employees. These benefits include 30 days of paid time off that employees can use for any absence related to the pandemic or a natural disaster, four additional well-being paid rest days and reimbursement for certain expenses related to remote working. In addition, we have a global mental health offering through a third-party provider who gives our employees and their families access to counseling, personal coaches and a variety of digital wellness resources. 
Development
We believe in leadership and learning and invest in the development of all our employees. Our vision is to further enhance our talent practices and leadership behaviors in order to empower more autonomous decision making, leverage data insights, reinforce open communication and feedback, and set clear rules of engagement to systemically foster increased trust and transparency. We are strongly committed to our responsibility of providing development and growth opportunities to our employees through greater emphasis on internal mobility and fair and equitable talent practices. Employees take advantage of live courses, leadership programs, online training, product training, sales training, technical training, mentor programs, team building events, seminars, conferences, lectures, university programs, peer-to-peer and manager-led training and other learning opportunities across the company.
