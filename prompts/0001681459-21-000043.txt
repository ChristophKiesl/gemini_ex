History
In March 2015, FMC Technologies, Inc., a U.S. Delaware corporation (“FMC Technologies”), and Technip S.A., a French société anonyme (“Technip”), signed an agreement to form an exclusive alliance and to launch Forsys Subsea, a 50/50 joint venture, that would unite the subsea skills and capabilities of two industry leaders. This alliance, which became operational on June 1, 2015, was established to identify new and innovative approaches to the design, delivery, and maintenance of subsea fields.
Forsys Subsea brought the industry’s most-talented subsea professionals together early in operators’ project concept phase with the technical capabilities to design and integrate products, systems, and installation to significantly reduce the cost of subsea field development and enhance overall project economics.
Based on the success of the Forsys Subsea joint venture and its innovative approach to integrated solutions, Technip and FMC Technologies announced in May 2016 that the companies would combine through a merger of equals to create a global subsea leader, TechnipFMC, that would drive change by redefining the production of oil and gas. The business combination was completed on January 16, 2017 (the “Merger”), and on January 17, 2017, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified, combined company trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange (“Euronext Paris”) under the symbol “FTI.”
In 2017, our first year as a merged company, TechnipFMC secured several project awards as many operators moved forward with final investment decisions for major onshore projects and subsea developments. Several of the subsea awards incorporated the use of our integrated approach to project delivery, validating our unique business model aimed at lowering project costs and accelerating the delivery of initial hydrocarbon production. This was made possible by bringing together the complimentary subsea work scopes of the merged companies.
In 2018, TechnipFMC delivered the industry’s first three full-cycle, integrated projects and realized considerable growth in Subsea order inbound, driven in part by its unique integrated offering, iEPCI™ (“iEPCI”). For all of 2019, the value of integrated subsea awards to TechnipFMC more than doubled versus the prior year, representing more than 50% of all Subsea project order inbound. The increase was driven by a wider adoption of the integrated 
business model, particularly by those clients where we have unique alliances. With the industry’s most comprehensive and only truly integrated subsea market offering, we have continued to expand the deepwater opportunity set for our clients.
TechnipFMC’s expertise does not end with the production of hydrocarbons. Because of its best-in-class Engineering and Construction (“E&C”) project design and execution capabilities, enabled by a portfolio of proprietary technologies, TechnipFMC continues to secure and deliver projects that further enable our clients to monetize resources – from liquefaction of gas, both onshore and on floating vessels, through refining and product facilities and with green chemistry and renewables.
The Spin-off
On August 26, 2019, we announced our intention to separate into two diversified pure-play market leaders – TechnipFMC, focused on subsea and surface hydrocarbon production, and Technip Energies, focused on downstream engineering, procurement, and construction (”EPC”) project execution. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decline in commodity prices, and the heightened volatility in global equity markets, on March 15, 2020, we announced the postponement of the completion of the transaction until the markets sufficiently recover. On January 7, 2021, we announced the resumption of activity toward completion of the transaction based on increased clarity in the market outlook and our demonstrated ability to successfully execute projects. 
On February 16, 2021, we completed the separation of the Technip Energies business segment. The transaction was structured as a spin-off (the “Spin-off”), which occurred by way of a pro rata dividend (the “Distribution”) to our shareholders of 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares in Technip Energies N.V. Each of our shareholders received one ordinary share of Technip Energies N.V. for every five ordinary shares of TechnipFMC held at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the record date, February 17, 2021. Technip Energies N.V. is now an independent public company and its shares trade under the ticker symbol “TE” on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.
In connection with the Spin-off, on January 7, 2021, BPI, which has been one of our substantial shareholders since 2009, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which BPI agreed to purchase a portion of our retained stake in Technip Energies N.V. (the “BPI Investment”) for $200.0 million (the “Purchase Price”). On February 25, 2021, BPI paid $200.0 million in connection with the Share Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Price is subject to adjustments, and BPI’s ownership stake will be determined based upon a thirty day volume-weighted average price of Technip Energies N.V.’ s shares (with BPI’s ownership collared between an 11.82 percentage floor and a 17.25 percentage cap), less a six percent discount. The BPI Investment is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval. We intend to significantly reduce our shareholding in Technip Energies N.V. over the 18 months following the Spin-off, including in connection with the sale of shares to BPI pursuant to the BPI Investment.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, Technip Energies’ historical financial results for periods prior to the Distribution will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.
The Spin-off enables both companies to benefit from distinct and compelling market opportunities across the energy value chain; dedicated focus of management, resources, and capital; and unique value propositions with differentiated investment appeal.
•TechnipFMC is a fully-integrated technology and services provider, driving energy development across deepwater, conventional, and unconventional resources. TechnipFMC continues to successfully demonstrate leadership in integrated subsea project delivery and is focused on replicating this success through the development of integrated production models for the surface market. TechnipFMC is also poised to benefit from service opportunities resulting from the world’s largest installed base of subsea production equipment, umbilicals, risers, and flowlines, and in the supply of surface integrated systems in the drilling, frac, production and measurement markets.
•Technip Energies is a leading engineering and construction player, with a robust project delivery model, strong technical capabilities, and proven track record as demonstrated by the successful execution of some of the world’s most iconic EPC projects. Technip Energies will continue to leverage its industry-leading process technology portfolio, particularly in the areas of ethylene and hydrogen, while pursuing further opportunities to enhance and differentiate this portfolio, and to accelerate the journey to a low-carbon future.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
On February 16, 2021, we completed the Spin-off. Subsequent to the Spin-off, we will operate under two reporting segments: Subsea and Surface Technologies.
Subsea
We are focused on transforming subsea by safely delivering innovative solutions that improve economics, enhance performance and reduce emissions. As a fully-integrated technology and services provider, we continue to drive responsible energy development. 
Our Subsea segment provides integrated design, engineering, procurement, manufacturing, fabrication, installation, and life of field services for subsea systems, subsea field infrastructure, and subsea pipe systems used in oil and gas production and transportation. 
We are an industry leader in front-end engineering and design (“FEED”), subsea production systems (“SPS”), subsea flexible pipe, and subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (“SURF”) and subsea robotics. We also have the capability to install these products and related subsea infrastructure with our fleet of highly specialized vessels. By integrating the SPS and SURF work scopes, we are able to drive greater value to our clients through more efficient field layout and execution of the installation campaign. This capability, in conjunction with our strong commercial focus, has enabled the successful market introduction of an integrated subsea business model, iEPCI, which spans a project’s early phase design through the life of field. 
Our integrated business model is unlocking incremental opportunities and materially expanding the deepwater opportunity set. Since the first iEPCI project was awarded in 2016, market adoption of the business model has accelerated each year. 
Through integrated FEED studies, or iFEED™ (“iFEED”), we are uniquely positioned to influence project concept and design. Using innovative solutions for field architecture, including standardized equipment, new technologies, and simplified installation, we can significantly reduce subsea development costs and accelerate time to first production.
Our first-mover advantage and ability to convert iFEED studies into iEPCI contracts, often as a direct award, creates a unique set of opportunities for us that are not available to our peers. This allows us to deliver a fully integrated – and technologically differentiated – subsea system, and to better manage the complete work scope through a single contracting mechanism and a single interface, yielding meaningful improvements in project economics and time to first oil.
We continue to support our clients following project delivery by offering aftermarket and life of field services. Our wide range of capabilities and solutions, including integrated life of field, or iLOF™ (“iLOF”), allows us to help clients increase oil and gas recovery and equipment uptime while reducing overall cost. Our iLOF offering is designed to unlock the full potential of subsea infrastructures during operations by transforming the way subsea services are delivered and proactively addressing the challenges operators face over the life of subsea fields. We provide production optimization, asset life extension insight, proactive de-bottlenecking, and condition-based maintenance.
Our Subsea business depends on our ability to maintain a cost-effective and efficient production system, achieve planned equipment production targets, successfully develop new products, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.
Subsea segment products and services
Subsea Production Systems. Our systems are used in the offshore production of crude oil and natural gas. Subsea systems are placed on the seafloor and are used to control the flow of crude oil and natural gas from the reservoir to a host processing facility, such as a floating production facility, a fixed platform, or an onshore facility.
Our subsea production systems and products include subsea trees, chokes and flow modules, manifold pipeline systems, controls and automation systems, well access systems, multiphase and wet-gas meters, and additional technologies. The design and manufacture of our subsea systems requires a high degree of technical expertise and innovation. Some of our systems are designed to withstand exposure to the extreme hydrostatic pressure of deepwater environments, as well as internal pressures of up to 20,000 pounds per square inch ("psi") and 
temperatures of up to 400º F. The development of our integrated subsea production systems includes initial engineering design studies and field development planning and considers all relevant aspects and project requirements, including optimization of drilling programs and subsea architecture.
Subsea Processing Systems. Our subsea processing systems, which include subsea boosting, subsea gas compression, and subsea separation, are designed to accelerate production, increase recovery, extend field life, and/or lower operators’ production costs for greenfield, subsea tie-back and brownfield applications.

Asset Services include all service offerings, such as (i) maintenance services for test, modification, refurbishment, and upgrade of subsea equipment and tooling; (ii) integrity services based on product and field data to optimize the performance of the subsea asset, including proactive inspection, maintenance, and repair (“IMR”) of subsea infrastructure; and (iii) production metering services to enhance well and field production, including real time virtual metering services and flow assurance services.
Key drivers of subsea services market activity are the services linked to subsea wells in greenfield development and brownfield subsea tiebacks, or infill developments.

Additionally, with our extensive experience in subsea equipment, our leading installed base of subsea production equipment, our broad range of services, and our historical technical design and manufacturing leadership, we are in a unique position to offer integrated solutions across the “life of field” (“LOF”) services. These combine asset light solutions (e.g. RLWI), digital services (e.g. data driven monitoring, surveillance, and production management suite of applications), and leading edge automated and robotic systems (e.g. Schilling ROVs) to enhance the economics of producing fields through maximization of asset uptime, higher production volumes, and lower operating expense.
Robotics, Controls and Automation. We design and manufacture ROVs and manipulator arms that are used in subsea drilling, construction, IMR, and life of field services. Our product offering includes hydraulic work-class ROVs, tether-management systems, launch and recovery systems, remote manipulator arms, and modular control systems. We also provide support and services such as product training, pilot simulator training, spare parts, and technical assistance.
We also provide electro-hydraulic and electric production and intervention control systems, allowing accurate control and monitoring of subsea installations to ensure the highest production availability that can ensure safe and environmentally friendly field operations. These include the sensors, multiphase flow meters, digital infrastructure, integrity monitoring, control functionality, and automation features needed for subsea systems. Robotics capabilities are now being used in the control of manifold valves during production, which demonstrates a convergence of our technologies in order to provide better systems for our customers.
Subsea Studio™ Digital Platform. Subsea Studio™ is our portfolio of digital solutions to increase performance, transform experience, and enable innovation. Subsea Studio™ FD is our front-end field development tool, 
transforming conventional concept, FEED and tender phases into ultra-fast digital field development. Subsea Studio™ Ex is our project execution digital application that increases the efficiency and speed of project execution with a data-centric approach. Subsea Studio™ LOF uses our digitally enabled operations and advanced data driven services to enhance performance and production targets.
Research, Engineering, Manufacturing and Supply Chain (“REMS”). REMS is an organization formed in September of 2019 to support accelerated technology innovation, and product delivery improvements. We accomplish this by reducing the cycle-time of engineering and manufacturing our products, including working with our suppliers to reduce their costs, and optimizing our processes and how we manage workflow. Through REMS, we are focused on challenging existing technologies and implementing world-class manufacturing practices, including LEAN and process automation, to improve reliability while reducing total product cost and lead time to delivery. Our REMS organization primarily supports our Subsea segment but is also integrated across our Surface Technologies segment.
Product Management. In 2019, we established a Product Management function to expand our capabilities to assess, define, and deliver the technologies and products of the future. This function enables REMS, and the Subsea and Surface Technologies businesses to drive the understanding of customer requirements, competitive landscape, and investment prioritization.
Capital Intensity
Many of the systems and products we supply for subsea applications are highly engineered to meet the unique demands of our customers’ field properties and are typically ordered one to two years before installation. We often receive advance payments and progress billings from our customers to fund initial development and working capital requirements.
Dependence on Key Customers
Generally, our customers in the Subsea segment are major integrated oil companies, national oil companies, and independent exploration and production companies.
We actively pursue alliances with companies that are engaged in the subsea development of oil and natural gas to promote our integrated systems for subsea production. These alliances are typically related to the procurement of subsea production equipment, although some alliances are related to EPCI services. Development of subsea fields, particularly in deepwater environments, involves substantial capital investments. Operators have also sought the security of alliances with us to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of subsea and other energy-related systems that provide integrated solutions to meet their needs.
Our alliances establish important ongoing relationships with our customers. While these alliances do not contractually commit our customers to purchase our systems and services, they have historically led to, and we expect that they would continue to result in, such purchases.
The commitment to our customers goes beyond project delivery, and we nurture these alliances with transparency and collaboration to better understand their needs to ensure customer success.
No single Subsea customer accounted for 10% or more of our 2020 consolidated revenue.
Competition
We are the only fully integrated company that can provide the complete suite of subsea production equipment, umbilicals, and flowlines with the complete portfolio of installation and LOF services enabling us to develop a subsea field as a single company. We compete with companies that supply some of the components as well as installation companies. Our competitors include Aker Solutions ASA, Baker Hughes Company (“Baker Hughes”), Dril-Quip, Inc., McDermott International, Inc. (“McDermott”), National Oilwell Varco, Oceaneering International, Inc., Saipem S.p.A. (“Saipem”), Schlumberger, Ltd. (“Schlumberger”), and Subsea 7 S.A.
Seasonality
In the North Sea, winter weather generally subdues drilling activity, reducing vessel utilization and demand for subsea services as certain activities cannot be performed. As a result, the level of offshore activity in our Subsea segment is negatively impacted in the first quarter of each year.
Market Environment
The volatile, and generally low, crude oil price environment of the last several years led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans and defer new deepwater projects. Order activity in 2020 was particularly impacted by the sharp decline in commodity prices in April, driven in part by the reduced economic activity, and the general uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction and deferral of new projects resulted in delayed subsea projects inbound for the industry.
While economic activity continues to be impacted by the pandemic, the short-term outlook for crude oil has improved as the OPEC+ countries better manage the oversupplied market. Long-term demand for energy is still forecast to rise, and we believe this outlook will ultimately provide our customers with the confidence to increase investments in new sources of oil and natural gas production.
The trajectory and pace of further recovery and expansion in the subsea market is subject to the capital our clients dedicate to developing offshore oil and gas fields amongst their entire portfolio of projects and drivers of capital expansion or discipline. The risk of project sanctioning delays is still present in the current environment; however, innovative approaches to subsea projects, like our iEPCI solution, have improved project economics, and many offshore discoveries can be developed economically at today’s crude oil prices. In the long-term, deepwater development is expected to remain a significant part of many of our customers’ portfolios.
As the subsea industry continues to evolve, we have taken actions to further streamline our organization, achieve standardization, and reduce cycle times. The rationalization of our global footprint will also further leverage the benefits of our integrated offering. We aim to continuously align our operations with activity levels, while preserving our core capacity in order to deliver current projects in backlog and future order activity.
Strategy
With our proprietary technologies and production systems, and integration expertise, we are transforming subsea by safely delivering innovative solutions that improve economics, enhance performance, and reduce emissions. We have used these capabilities to develop a new subsea commercial model that is transforming the way we interact with our customers and create value with them.
Our strategy includes the following priorities:
•Engagement in the conceptual design and integrated front-end engineering of subsea development projects to create value through technology and integration of scopes by simplifying field architecture and accelerating both delivery schedules and time to first production.
•Innovative research and development (“R&D”), often in collaboration with clients and partners, to develop leading products and technologies that deliver greater efficiency to the client, lower development costs, unlock stranded and/or marginal fields, and enable frontier developments.
•Focus on selecting the right projects to ensure a strong and healthy backlog.
•Superior project execution capabilities allowing us to mobilize the right teams, assets, and facilities to capture and profitably execute complex subsea projects and services.
•Capitalize on combined competencies coming from alliances and partnerships with both clients and suppliers.
•Leverage supplier relationships to optimize supply chain market dynamics and implement greater simplification and standardization in products and processes.
TechnipFMC is a clear leader in the subsea industry. Our success has been built on our technological strength, innovation, focus on digitalization, and strong partnerships with major oil companies to expand market opportunities.
Recent and Future Developments
We continue to focus on performance improvement and optimization strategies that will improve our profitability. Our investments decisions fully support our business with technologies that will differentiate our portfolio.
Subsea StudioTM is transforming the conventional concept, FEED and tendering phases of subsea projects. Working with our clients, we are now able to develop ultra-fast, digital field architectures that bring together decades of engineering knowledge with artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize product configurations, accelerate execution, and maximize value.
Subsea StudioTM has an open architecture that allows integration with other engineering and manufacturing systems, eliminating the need for multiple hand-offs, and resulting in as much as a 50% reduction in the time required for front-end engineering. We are extending the platform beyond subsea system design to incorporate the execution and field management phases of a project. Once fully implemented, we will have a complete digital thread from concept design, all the way through to the life of the field.
To further our commitment to meaningfully contribute to the energy transition, we formed New Energy Ventures to define a detailed business plan and identify and develop business opportunities and investment cases. We seek to make energy more sustainable through electrification of offshore fields through renewable sources. Offshore floating wind, wave energy, and green hydrogen will be main contributors to our subsea energy transition vision. Our core competencies in systems engineering, safety control and systems, high pressure gas pipelines and risers, connection systems, and subsea tank systems are easily transferable from oil and gas to alternative energy solutions.
We have set a target to reduce up to 50 percent of CO2 emissions from offshore upstream life of field. Subsea is a field development solution that is uniquely positioned to minimize carbon footprint and drive simplification in field design, product design and offshore operations to enable a platform-less future.
Subsea all-electric field developments enable longer step-out and tiebacks as well as unmanned platforms and operations. Subsea processing and power solutions move technology from topside to seabed. Automation and robotics such as the Gemini ROV represent a step change towards autonomous operations.
Our subsea products and infrastructure help our clients' businesses be less carbon intensive across activities by reducing CO2 emissions.
We expect our iEPCI capabilities to provide a competitive advantage as we deliver comprehensive and differentiated solutions. In addition, we anticipate the following longer-term trends in the subsea market:
•Increased market adoption of integrated subsea projects, leading to further penetration of our integrated business model and higher levels of iEPCI order activity for our Company.
•Growing service opportunities, driven by (i) higher levels of project activity, (ii) increased asset integrity and production management activities focused on improving uptime and production volume and lowering emissions, and (iii) increased maintenance and intervention activity resulting from an expanding and aging installed equipment base.
•Smaller projects (less than $75 million) and direct awards will continue to contribute meaningfully to our order mix. In 2020, these awards collectively represented more than half of our total subsea inbound orders, with the remainder being publicly announced projects and subsea service activities. Subsea tiebacks are often part of this mix, and these shorter cycle brownfield expansions provide operators with faster paybacks and higher returns.
•There is a growing trend towards independent operators and new entrants undertaking subsea developments; we are a natural partner for this customer group because of our ability to offer fully integrated solutions.
•Natural gas developments are growing in prominence. We believe that more than 20 percent of offshore capital expenditures could be directed at natural gas developments by early next decade. We also anticipate that 45 percent of gas production will come from offshore, with significant growth in the Middle East (shallow water) followed by Australia (deep water) in the next five years.
We continue to work closely with our customers and believe that, in the context of lower oil prices, with our unique business model we can further reduce their project break-even levels by offering cost-effective approaches to their project developments and accelerating time to first oil and gas.
Product Development
Technology development progressed on our Subsea 2.0™ (“Subsea 2.0”) product platform, the next generation of subsea equipment, using designs that are significantly simpler, leaner, and smarter than current designs. These products incorporate a modular product architecture and component level standardization to enable a flexible configure-to-order approach, reducing hardware delivery time for clients. The products are expected to deliver breakthroughs in the way subsea products are manufactured, assembled, installed, and maintained over the life of the field. Incorporating our Subsea 2.0 platform can greatly simplify the subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. When combined with iEPCI, it also simplifies vessel installation campaigns by providing an even greater environmental and economic benefit and unlocks first oil and gas faster. In 2020, we installed Subsea 2.0 trees on two projects, with production under way offshore in Brazil. Additionally, we were awarded our latest iEPCI project with Shell in Malaysia. It incorporates our Subsea 2.0 technology as well as a diverse set of other projects in some of the most active basins in the world.
Our Joint Industry Program for electrification of the field progressed well this year. This system solution will drive reduced emissions, enable more digitally enabled intelligent field operations, improve economics for long step-out and subsea tie-back to short field developments, and contribute to a more sustainable way to develop oil and gas resources.
In a partnership with Halliburton, we introduced Odassea™, the first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This technology platform enables operators to execute intervention-less seismic imaging and reservoir diagnostics to reduce total cost of ownership while improving reservoir knowledge. This project expands our unique integrated subsea solution and leverages the competencies and know-how to drive a higher level of sustainability. In the field, we are delivering solutions with the technology to multiple subsea projects at all stages from conceptual design to execution and installation.
This year, we have also advanced on our journey towards more autonomous operations with the launch of the Gemini™® (“Gemini”) ROV system, featuring advanced automation and precision robotics to increase offshore productivity. Gemini is the next generation of advanced 250 horse power work class ROV system providing unprecedented subsea productivity. The integration of ROV, manipulators and tooling enables a transition to highly automated subsea robotics, which reduces task time from hours to minutes, ensuring predictable results every time. Featuring a significant advancement in manipulator design, the Gemini manipulators provide integrated hydraulics, electric power, communications, and force compliance. Additionally, the ROV has access to more than 30 subsea exchangeable tools and a comprehensive fluid intervention system to support the most demanding deepwater drilling and completion operations. With a depth rating of up to 4,000 meters, Gemini can remain subsea for one month, enabling 24/7 operations without recovery for tooling reconfiguration. Its combination of system availability, capability and productivity reduces operational costs and delivers unequaled performance.
In addition to investments to develop lower-cost production solutions, we also invest in the development of technology to expand our service portfolio. As an example, we have simultaneously launched a suite of new ROV services for drill rigs alongside Gemini to drive even greater efficiency.
Acquisitions and Investments
We did not make any material acquisitions or corporate investments in 2020. We have focused on business transformation to mitigate the adverse effects of the rapidly changing market environment and to ensure the long-term viability of our subsea business.

Going forward, we will need fewer assets to deliver more comprehensive solutions: 
•We are optimizing our operations across geographies, and if economic returns don’t make sense, we will look to exit.
•We continue to right-size our assets to better align with and leverage the benefits of our differentiated offering and the advantages of new technologies – such as Subsea 2.0 – and integrated project delivery.
•We continue to partner with others, providing us access to unique assets in a more capital efficient manner. 
As the subsea industry continues to evolve, we are accelerating actions to further streamline our organization, achieve standardization, and reduce cycle times. We aim to continuously align our operations with activity levels, while preserving our core capacity in order to deliver current projects in backlog and future order activity.

Fracturing Tree and Manifold Systems. During the completion of a shale well, the well undergoes hydraulic fracturing. During this phase, durable and wear-resistant wellsite equipment is temporarily deployed. Our equipment is designed to sustain the high pressure and highly erosive fracturing fluid which is pumped through the well into the formation.
Our equipment (fracturing tree systems, fracturing valve greasing systems, hydraulic control units, fracturing manifold systems, and rigid and flexible flowlines) is temporarily laid out between the wellhead and the fracturing pump truck during hydraulic fracturing. These products are typically supplied to exploration and production operators who rent this equipment directly from us during the hydraulic fracturing activities. Associated with our fracturing equipment rental is fracturing rig-up / rig-down field service personnel as well as oversight and operation of the equipment during the multiple fracturing stages for a shale well.
TechnipFMC’s manifold solutions help increase operational efficiency for a pad site with multiple wells. Our SuperFrac™ Manifold provides time savings and pumping efficiencies when stimulating multiple wells on a single pad. The manifolds are installed and connected to multiple trees off the critical path, which allows our customers to fracture more stages per day in a compact footprint and efficiently move operations from one well to another, saving time and money. We also offer conventional and articulating arm manifold trailers, which are used as the connection point between fracturing pump trucks and the fracturing flowline and manifold system.
Our Ground Level Fracturing System is an essential tool for unconventional operators who use simultaneous operations to efficiently run completions in multi-well pads. The innovative system design uses various lengths of trunkline to align the SuperFrac™ Manifold and fracturing tree at ground level, which minimizes the number of flowline connections for safer operation. We are a significant supplier of flowline pipework (rigid and flexible) that is used to move the fracturing product from the pump truck, via the manifold and into the fracturing trees.

Our separation portfolio and measurement technologies, combined with our expertise in modularization, enable our customers to achieve first production faster with fully optimized and environmentally conscious, compact systems.
Flowback and Well Testing Services. After a shale well is hydraulically fractured, the well moves to the flowback phase in which much of the fracturing fluid pumped into the well flows back out through the wellhead and fracturing tree system. This phase lasts until the wellbore flow is adequate for flow through the production facilities downstream of the wellsite. Our flowback and well testing offering includes chokes, de-sanders, and advanced well testing equipment and related services which are provided to exploration and production operators during the flowback phase. Our Automated Well Testing Package (AWT™) is now widely used in North America enabling operators to remove personnel from processes and its digital package anticipates service. These offerings enable a substantial reduction in downtime and enhanced safety.

TechnipFMC continues to innovate and introduce new technologies across our portfolio of products and services. Leveraging our vast experience and competencies from decades of working in the transformation of the energy sector, we enable our clients to achieve their energy transition targets.
In Subsea, we fundamentally changed the way we design, manage, and execute projects, starting with digital tools such as our Subsea Studio™. Our Subsea 2.0™ platform can greatly simplify subsea infrastructure, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50%. Combined with iEPCI™, our unique integrated model, it simplifies vessel installation campaigns, providing an even greater environmental and economic benefit. Our vision includes an “all-electric” system powered by renewable energy, with the potential to eliminate emissions.
Technip Energies continues to break boundaries and accelerate the journey to a low-carbon society. With decades of experience in the energy industry, Technip Energies is using its engineering, process and technology competencies as well as R&D facilities to find decarbonized solutions for a better environment. Technip Energies has structured its energy transition framework around four pillars: LNG, sustainable chemistry, decarbonization and carbon-free energy solutions. Technip Energies is a leader in gas treatment and liquefaction and has significant expertise and prospects in sustainable chemistry, such as its partnership with Neste’s for renewable diesel projects. It has expanded its footprint in the circular economy, including collaboration with Carbios to demonstrate its recycling technology. Technip Energies’ Genesis advisory services have a particular focus on energy transition. Technip Energies is a leader in hydrogen, with proven technology to deliver blue hydrogen and, through its investment in McPhy, it is well positioned for the emerging Green hydrogen market. 
Surface Technologies’ high-efficiency solutions enable our clients to reach hydrocarbons faster with fully optimized and environmentally compact systems. Our integrated service lines, such as iProduction™ and iComplete™, provide additional opportunities and benefits to our customers. For instance, a project utilizing our iProduction™ integrated production system allows the client to capture more than 50 percent of the greenhouse gases that are typically released into the atmosphere during the production phase of an unconventional development.
OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our business segments purchase carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and steel castings and forgings from the global marketplace. We typically do not use single source suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases; however, certain geographic areas of our businesses, or a project or group of projects, may heavily depend on certain suppliers for raw materials or supply of semi-finished goods. We believe the available supplies of raw materials are adequate to meet our needs.
Research and Development
We are engaged in R&D activities directed toward the improvement of existing products and services, the design of specialized products to meet customer needs, and the development of new products, processes, and services. A large part of our product development spending has focused on the improved design and standardization of our Subsea and Technip Energies products to meet our customer needs.
Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property
We own a number of patents, trademarks, and licenses that are cumulatively important to our businesses. As part of our ongoing R&D focus, we seek patents when appropriate for new products, product improvements, and related service innovations. We have approximately 7,300 issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Further, we license intellectual property rights to or from third parties. We also own numerous trademarks and trade names and have approximately 660 registrations and pending applications worldwide.
We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take actions we deem appropriate to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights. We do not believe, however, that the loss of any one patent, trademark, or license, or group of related patents, trademarks, or licenses would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.

HUMAN CAPITAL
Diversity
In the first quarter of 2018, we developed a global framework and key performance indicators for 2018 and beyond to promote and accelerate the development of women in all functions of our global organization. 
Our Advancing Gender Diversity objectives include the following:
•Ensure gender pay equality everywhere we operate and review all jobs to ensure gender pay equality and monitor them through a full review every three years.
•Improve gender balance in the organization, across all functions and levels.
•Promote women fairly and equally through the career development process.
In 2018, we reviewed 100 percent of job functions to ensure pay equity. We identified areas for improvement and completed all necessary salary adjustments in 2019 to ensure fair compensation for all of our employees. Continuous monitoring to ensure pay equity was a focus for 2020. Additionally, in 2020, we announced a global parental leave policy for 2021 implementation. 
In 2019, to foster a diverse and inclusive culture, we launched its “Diversity & Inclusion – It Matters!” e-learning module with an aim to raise awareness of our differences and help our employees improve as people and professionals. This e-learning module was added to new hire orientation in 2020 to promote our commitment to advancing gender diversity and an inclusive culture where all employees can reach their full potential. We also continued to improve gender balance in 2020 with a focus on increasing the representation of women hired as new graduates. 40 percent of all graduates hired globally in 2020 were women, surpassing our goal of 30 percent.
We continued to foster Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) and encourage participation throughout the whole Company. Our CEO made the pledge to CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, committing to create a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed and employees feel comfortable and empowered to draw on their unique experiences and backgrounds. Our seven ERGs continue to be instrumental in engaging employees and creating a platform to have complex, and sometimes difficult conversations about diversity and inclusion. 
Continuous discussions around improving representation of women in the organization helps us promote women fairly and equally throughout their career development process within our Company. In 2020, our People and Culture team reviewed all senior management succession plans to ensure that female candidates were considered and included.
As a result, 76 percent of our senior management succession plans in 2020 include at least one woman versus 70 percent in 2019, which exceeded our 2020 goal to increase representation of women in succession plans by five percent. 
As of December 31, 2020, TechnipFMC had the following number of employees:

 | Male Employees | | Female Employees | | Total | | % of Female Employees
 | 2019 | 2020 | | 2019 | 2020 | | 2019 | 2020 | 2019 | 2020 
Executive officers | 7 | 5 | | 4 | 3 | | 11 | 8 | 36 | % | 38 | % 
Senior managers | 84 | 92 | | 24 | 19 | | 108 | 111 | 22 | % | 19 | % 
Employees on payroll (overall) | 28,760 | | 26,948 | | | 8,407 | | 8,135 | | 37,167 | | 35,086 | 23 | % | 23 | %

We are committed to improving this dimension and took necessary steps in strengthening our succession plans and graduate intake in 2020. We have also developed an inclusive leadership curriculum, which, along with executive leadership team commitment and systemic changes to policy and talent standards, will help improve women representation in senior manager roles in the medium to long term. 
In June 2020, we decided to broaden our inclusion focus by reflecting not only gender but also race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and disability. This committee is renamed to “Inclusion and Diversity” empowering our people to be the difference through inclusion and exercising the value of diversity. This will be accomplished through our people, culture and internal and external partnerships.
Promoting Cultural and Ethnic Diversity
We focus on our broad cultural and ethnic diversity, which we constantly promote and develop throughout the Company and our subsidiaries, through the internationalization of our teams, multicultural programs, and international mobility.
Providing Employment to People with Disabilities
Three of our Foundational Beliefs – integrity, respect, and sustainability – are tangibly embedded in fair employment practices and equal opportunity. Our policy is that our employment decisions related to recruitment, selection, evaluation, compensation, and development, among others, are not influenced by unlawful or unfair discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, gender or gender reassignment, marital status, or disability.
It is our policy to encourage and give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled people, and to assist with their training and development in light of their aptitudes and abilities. If an existing employee becomes disabled, it is our policy wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under our usual terms and conditions, and to provide training, career development, and promotion opportunities to the disabled employee to the fullest extent possible.
Employee and Social Matters
People and culture are at the heart of our development strategy. People are our wealth and strength. We are committed to our employees, our employee guidelines are specified in our Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all employees, regardless of their roles and where they work.
We believe that all of our employees are entitled to fair treatment, courtesy, and respect, wherever they work: in the office, on vessels, on industrial and construction sites, or in client offices. We do not tolerate any form of abuse or harassment, and we will not tolerate any action, conduct, or behavior that is humiliating, intimidating, or hostile.
Furthermore, our hiring and employee development decisions are fair and objective. Employment decisions are based only on relevant qualifications, performance, demonstrated skills, experience, and other job-related factors, with our goal of creating a diverse, tolerant, and inclusive workforce. 
Workforce Overview
Our workforce consists of the following: 

 | December 31
 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 
Permanent employees | 33,528 | 34,454 | 31,395
Temporary employees (fixed-term) | 3,616 | 2,713 | 3,691 
Employees on payroll | 37,144 | 37,167 | 35,086
Contracted workforce | 3,458 | 5,310 | 2,880 
Total workforce | 40,602 | 42,477 | 37,966

Developing and Keeping Talent
We simplified the process of identifying key talents in the organization in 2020 and the new process helped us achieve significant and quality progress in a remote working environment. We also strengthened the depth of our succession planning for leadership roles in the organization. 
Following the 2019 enhancement of our processes and practices, in 2020 we continued our journey of offering best-in-class development opportunities to our people: 
•We introduced a new process called 'Talking Talents' in 2020 to identify and flag talents to develop in the key areas of Leadership, Technology and Project Management. This population represented 6 percent of our global population and will be the primary focus for development initiatives.
•Our new and improved performance appraisal process kicked off for all TechnipFMC employees in October 2020 and we concluded with 98 percent completion. A stronger focus was put on employees’ behaviors, as part of our core values framework, and a simplified workflow for employees and managers for an efficient performance appraisal process. 
•We continued to support our talent acquisition efforts by reinforcing the TechnipFMC employer brand in 2020, reflecting what our people say about TechnipFMC: we work on breakthrough projects, in a global playground and, as a result, our people live inspiring experiences. This is the key message we want potential future employees to associate with TechnipFMC. Initiatives, such as #technipfmcproud, launched in 2020 comprised of a series of webinars, inviting employees to share their own inspiring TechnipFMC experiences. This, along with other initiatives and onboarding of brand ambassadors, helped us put our employer brand into operation in 2020.
Enabling our people to grow and develop is a significant priority and during 2020 we launched and improved upon a number of learning and knowledge management initiatives to enhance the capabilities of our employees. While our ambition is to create a learning environment and tools and resources for everyone to succeed - some of our content is indeed focused on the following development pathways of Leadership, Technology and Project Management mentioned earlier.
•In October 2020, we launched the global technical expertise program, onboarding more than 650 technical experts and laying the foundation for identifying and nurturing more technical experts who help us in creating differentiated technologies.
•Engagement in the iLearn learning platform gained significant traction in 2020 as we embraced a digital transformation of learning. This hub is a learning experience platform with a modern and easy-to-use interface. In 2020, there were more than 6,860 pieces of creative and innovative learning content available, with ongoing releases of new and meaningful courses, to support skills development for our employees and enhance their performance in their job. 50 percent of our training hours and 95 percent of our course completions were done in a digital or virtual environment, which resulted in 5.85 training hours per employee. The top five areas of learning in 2020 were Health, Safety, Environment and Security, Engineering, Manufacturing, Quality and Surface. 
•2020 also saw significant progress in the knowledge management space with our knowledge repository “The Well” having over 646,000 visits with 16,674 employees having utilized it. Our second knowledge-sharing platform, The Bridge, which aligns with The Well, enables chartered global knowledge-sharing networks. It had a soft launch in May 2020, and now has 17 enterprise-wide business and technical communities with the expectation that there will be more than 50 by the end of 2021.
Employee attrition in 2020 was 2.5 percent compared to 6.2 percent in 2019 attributable to a major extent to our continued focus on learning and talent development.
Strengthening Social Dialogue
TechnipFMC has developed a culture that is based on the values of trust, mutual respect, and dialogue. In accordance with local legislation, regular meetings with trade union-appointed and/or works council representatives are organized for information and/or consultation. The European Works Council (“EWC”) meets at least twice a year and all of our European entities had joined the EWC by the end of 2019 with the EWC agreement signed by participants' representatives by the end of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, the EWC elected its new member and held two meetings in 2020, first in May and the second in December.
We also foster ERGs, which are voluntary, employee-led focus groups dedicated to a diverse and inclusive work environment. We currently have seven active ERGs with approximately 1,800 members in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil, covering Diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, Mothers Network, Black Organization for Leadership & Development, Young Professionals Group, Military Veterans & Friends Network, and Handicap Inclusion. ERGs discuss and promote topics related to diversity and inclusion, develop and organize workshops internally and externally, support local initiatives, and propose actions to improve accessibility and inclusivity for all at the workplace. TechnipFMC provides executive support to our ERGs to help maintain cordial employee relations and improve the wellbeing of our people. 
Employee Wellbeing
In light of the global challenges faced in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, we ran a global employee wellbeing survey in May to understand how our employees were coping with social distancing and other related domestic challenges during the pandemic. We received a strong response, with 19,954 (55 percent) employees responding globally which helped us develop policies to assist in the challenges our people are facing in these unprecedented times. 74 percent of responding employees answered favorably to the question on their overall wellbeing. The survey also gave us insights on other topics that helped in improving overall communication and employee engagement.
Internal Communication
We have a robust internal communications strategy and support communication channels that ensure that all employees are communicated to within a timely and relevant way. The effectiveness of internal communication is continually monitored and adjusted based on a focus group feedback program that reaches multiple levels across the organization. Employees are regularly consulted and provided with information on changes and events that may affect them through channels such as regular meetings, employee representatives, and our intranet site. These consultations and meetings ensure that employees are kept informed of the financial and economic factors affecting our performance and matters of concern to them as employees. 
Labor Relations and Collective Agreements
We seek to maintain constructive relationships with works councils and trade unions, and to comply with relevant local laws and collective agreements in relation to collective or individual labor relations. We also operate through local subsidiaries in many countries, a number of which, including France, Germany, Norway, and Italy, have legal requirements for works councils, which include employee representatives. 
We send regular information to all employees to share information about business success, changes to the organizational structure, and any major impact to the business or company. The same approach of sharing information and maintaining a regular dialogue with employees exists at a local level through the action of the local 
communications teams and the managers. In countries where staff representatives or works councils are in place, we seek to maintain an effective and regular dialogue. To get the direct feedback of employees, employees surveys are performed in some countries or business, such as Norway, Americas, and the Asia Pacific region. Every quarter, all employees receive a direct communication from the Chairman and CEO about our financial results and main business information. While travelling to a company center, the executive leadership team members take this as an opportunity to engage with employees, either through town halls or informal meetings.
