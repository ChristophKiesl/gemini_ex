ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Our Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986 as Terex U.S.A., Inc. Since that time, we have changed significantly, and much of this change has been historically accomplished through acquisitions and managing our portfolio of companies by divestiture of non-core businesses and products. Today, Terex is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms and materials processing machinery. We design, build and support products used in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, energy, minerals and materials management applications. Our products are manufactured in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and sold worldwide. We engage with customers through all stages of the product life cycle, from initial specification and financing to parts and service support. We continue to focus on becoming an industry leading operating company.
We report our business in the following segments: (i) Aerial Work Platforms (“AWP”) and (ii) Materials Processing (“MP”).

OTHER
We may assist customers in their rental, leasing and acquisition of our products through Terex Financial Services (“TFS”). TFS uses its equipment financing experience to facilitate financial products and services to assist in the acquisition of our equipment. TFS continually evaluates the level to which it utilizes third party funding versus providing direct customer financing to meet its business objectives.
In the United States and on a limited basis in China, TFS originates and services financing transactions directly with end-user customers, distributors and rental companies. Most of the transactions are fixed and floating rate loans; however, TFS also provides sales-type leases, operating leases and rentals. In the normal course of business, loans and leases are sold to third party financial institutions. Increasingly, and on a global basis, TFS facilitates financing transactions directly between our customers and third party financial institutions, providing recourse in certain circumstances. In addition, wholesale financing may be arranged between dealers and distributors who sell our equipment and financial institutions with which TFS has established relationships.
TFS continually monitors used equipment values of Terex equipment in the secondary market sales channels for all of our equipment categories. This provides a basis to project future values of equipment for the underwriting of leases or loans. These secondary market sales channels are also used for re-marketing any equipment which is returned at end of lease, or is repossessed in case of a customer default. When equipment is received, TFS uses the resale channel which maximizes proceeds and/or mitigates risk for Terex and our funding partners.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Mobile Cranes
On July 31, 2019, we completed the disposition of our Demag® mobile cranes business (“Demag”) to Tadano Ltd. and certain of its subsidiaries (“Tadano”). Products divested were our Demag® all terrain cranes and large lattice boom crawler cranes. During 2019, we also exited North American mobile crane product lines manufactured in our Oklahoma City facility. Our actions to sell Demag and cease the manufacturing of mobile crane product lines in our Oklahoma City facility represented a significant strategic shift in our business away from mobile cranes as these businesses constituted a significant part of our operations and financial results. We believe these actions were necessary to execute our strategy.
See Note D – “Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding dispositions and our discontinued operations.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Terex is a manufacturer of specialized capital equipment and related services. Our goal is to design, manufacture and market equipment and services that provide superior life-cycle return on invested capital to our customers (“Customer ROIC”). Customer ROIC is a key focus of our organization and is central to our ability to generate returns for investors.
We operate our business based on our value system, “The Terex Way.” The Terex Way values shape the culture of our Company and reflect our collective commitment to and understanding of what it means to be a part of Terex. The Terex Way is based on six key values:
•Integrity: Integrity reflects honesty, ethics, transparency and accountability. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all of our business dealings and we never sacrifice our integrity for profit.
•Respect: Respect incorporates concern for safety, health, teamwork, diversity, inclusion and performance. We treat all our team members, customers and suppliers with respect and dignity.
•Improvement: Improvement encompasses quality, problem-solving systems, a continuous improvement culture and collaboration. We continuously search for new and better ways of doing things, focusing on continuous improvement and the elimination of waste.
•Servant Leadership: Servant leadership requires service to others, humility, authenticity and leading by example. We work to serve the needs of our customers, investors and team members.
•Courage: Courage entails willingness to take risks, responsibility, action and empowerment. We have the courage to make a difference even when it is difficult.
•Citizenship: Citizenship means social responsibility and environmental stewardship. We comply with all laws, respect all people’s values and cultures, and are good global, national and local citizens.
From 2016 - 2019, Terex pursued a strategy based on three key themes:
1.Focus the portfolio on businesses best positioned to generate returns above the cost of capital through the cycle.
2.Simplify company structure, systems and footprint to improve efficiency and enhance global competitiveness.
3.Execute to Win, driving process discipline, execution rigor, and accountability in core processes.
The “Focus” theme concentrated our business portfolio in product categories where we are among the market leaders. Where we were not among the market leaders our strategy has been to either divest those product lines or pursue a business strategy which we believe will enable us to become a market leader. Work related to this strategic theme involved review of all businesses in the portfolio from the perspectives of market attractiveness and competitive position. Several portfolio actions were taken as a result, including disposition of our Material Handling and Port Solutions business (“MHPS”) and Demag, and the outcome was our current two-segment company in which greater than 90% of remaining businesses are top three in their respective categories and in which all remaining businesses have the demonstrated ability to sustainably out-earn the cost of capital.
The “Simplify” theme centered on complexity reduction and cost management. This involved efforts to flatten and streamline the organization. We undertook finance initiatives to simplify the way that we measure and manage the Company day-to-day and simplified the Company’s manufacturing footprint.
The “Execute to Win” theme focused on new process disciplines and on executing step change improvements in three core process areas: Strategic Sourcing, Commercial Excellence, and Life Cycle Solutions. Core teams were established in each area, and these teams drove programmatic changes across all businesses in the Company.
During 2020, we transitioned our “Focus, Simplify, Execute to Win” strategy to its next phase of “Execute, Innovate, Grow”.
The “Execute” theme continues the progress made with “Execute to Win”, while intensifying process discipline and improving measurement and accountability. We have now re-embedded responsibility for Strategic Sourcing, Commercial Excellence, and Lifecycle Solutions into our business segments, but the team members responsible for such are closely networked to one another and continue to share best practices. We are also implementing several new operational processes and enabling systems within the Company as part of the “Execute” theme.
The “Innovate” theme focuses on purposeful development of step-change improvements in Terex offerings and in the efficiency with which these offerings are executed and supported. When we talk about innovation at Terex, we mean doing things significantly better tomorrow than they have been done in the past by harnessing new thinking and applying technology in new and creative ways. While digitalization plays an important role in this and many of the innovations we currently pursue, there are many other aspects of this strategy that involve non-digital changes to the design of our products and improved ways of doing things.
The “Grow” theme is, in many ways, the outcome of doing “Execute” and “Innovate” well. We will successfully and profitably grow when we operate efficiently, apply new thinking in creating value for customers and take on new challenges through business investments (i.e. new category development, new geographic development). We also see a role for increased inorganic investment, smartly adding scope or depth to our Company via acquisitions. We are actively rebuilding our inorganic investment pipeline, with an eye towards adding new dimensions to the Company portfolio and applying our skills as a manager of specialized machinery businesses in new and complementary domains.
Our Disciplined Capital Allocation approach remains an important part of our overall strategy, including maintenance of an optimal capital structure (~2.5 average net debt to EBITDA over the cycle), growth investments, restructuring investments and efficient return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
Successful pursuit of the “Execute, Innovate, Grow” strategy will shape the direction of our Company over the coming years, much in the same way that “Focus, Simplify, Execute to Win” shaped our direction between 2016 and 2019. Terex is a diverse company that works collaboratively to deliver business performance efficiently and effectively. We balance the independence of our businesses with the benefits of total Company scale, and our ability to do this is central to the style of management in our Company.

MATERIALS PROCESSING
MATERIALS PROCESSING EQUIPMENT. Materials processing equipment is used in processing aggregate materials for building applications and is also used in the quarrying, mining, construction, demolition, recycling, landscaping and biomass production industries. Our materials processing equipment includes crushers, screens and feeders, washing systems and conveyors as well as wood and biomass chippers and grinders, concrete mixers and pavers.
We manufacture a range of jaw, impactor (both horizontal and vertical shaft) and cone crushers, as well as base crushers for integration within mobile, modular and static plants.
•Jaw crushers are used for crushing larger rock, primarily at the quarry face or on recycling duties. Applications include hard rock, sand and gravel and recycled materials. Cone crushers are used in secondary and tertiary applications to reduce a number of materials, including quarry rock and riverbed gravel.
•Horizontal shaft impactors are primary and secondary crushers. They are typically applied to reduce soft to medium hard materials, as well as recycled materials. Vertical shaft impactors are secondary and tertiary crushers that reduce material utilizing various rotor configurations and are highly adaptable to any application.
Our screening and feeder equipment includes:
•Heavy duty inclined and horizontal screens and feeders, which are used in low to high tonnage applications and are available as either stationary or heavy-duty mobile equipment. Screens are used in all phases of plant design from handling quarried material to fine screening. Dry screening is used to process materials such as sand, gravel, quarry rock, coal, ore, construction and demolition waste, soil, compost and wood chips.
•Feeders are used to unload materials from hoppers and bulk material storage at controlled rates. They are available for applications ranging from primary feed hoppers to fine material bin unloading. Our range includes apron feeders, grizzly feeders and pan feeders.
Washing system products include mobile and static wash plants incorporating separation, washing, scrubbing, dewatering and stockpiling. We manufacture mobile and stationary rinsing screens, scrubbing systems, sand screw dewaterers, bucket-wheel dewaterers, water management systems, hydrocyclone plants for efficient silt extraction and a range of stockpiling conveyors. Washing systems operate in the aggregates, recycling, mining and industrial sands segments.

•Rough terrain cranes move materials and equipment on rugged or uneven terrain and are often located on a single construction or work site for long periods. Rough terrain cranes cannot be driven on highways (other than in Italy) and accordingly must be transported by truck to the work site.
•Tower cranes are often used in urban areas where space is constrained and in long-term or high-rise building sites. Tower cranes lift construction material and place the material at the point of use. We produce self-erecting, hammerhead, flat top and luffing jib tower cranes.
•Concrete mixer trucks are machines with a large revolving drum in which cement is mixed with other materials to make concrete. We offer models with custom chassis with configurations from three to seven axles.
•Our concrete pavers are used to finish bridges, canals, concrete streets, highways and airport surfaces.
BACKLOG
Our backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):

 | December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019
AWP | $ | 825.6 | | | $ | 752.5 
MP | 523.4 | | | 328.7 | 
Total | $ | 1,349.0 | | | $ | 1,081.2

We define backlog as firm orders that are expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts orders are generally filled on an as-ordered basis.
Our management views backlog as one of many indicators of the performance of our business. Because many variables can cause changes in backlog and these changes may or may not be of any significance, we consequently view backlog as an important, but not necessarily determinative, indicator of future results.
Our overall backlog amounts at December 31, 2020 increased $267.8 million from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2019, due to higher orders across all business segments.
AWP segment backlog at December 31, 2020 increased approximately 10% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2019. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by customer optimism about a recovery following fleet reductions and delayed capital expenditures during 2020 in Western Europe and to a lesser extent North America and China.
MP segment backlog at December 31, 2020 increased approximately 59% from our backlog amounts at December 31, 2019. This increase from the prior year was driven primarily by higher demand in our aggregates, concrete and cranes businesses in North America and to a lesser extent Western Europe and Asia Pacific.
DISTRIBUTION

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
We maintain engineering staff primarily at our manufacturing locations to conduct research, development and engineering for site-specific products. We have also established competency centers that support entire segments from single locations in certain fields such as control systems. Our businesses also assess global trends to understand future needs of our customers and help us decide which technologies to implement in future development projects. In addition, our engineering center in India supports our engineering teams worldwide through new product design, existing product design improvement and development of products for local markets. Continually monitoring our materials, manufacturing and engineering costs is essential to identify possible savings, then leverage those savings to improve our competitiveness and our customers’ return on investment. Our research, development and engineering expenses are primarily incurred to develop (i) additional applications and extensions of our existing product lines to meet customer needs, such as the telematics application to remotely monitor and manage our products, and take advantage of growth opportunities, and (ii) customer responsive enhancements and continuous cost improvements of existing products.
Our engineering focus mirrors the business priorities of delivering customer responsive solutions, growing in developing markets, complying with evolving regulatory standards in our global markets and applying our lean manufacturing principles by standardizing products, rationalizing components and strategically aligning with select global suppliers. Our engineering teams in China and India represent our commitment to engineering products for developing markets. They take equipment technology from the developed markets and translate it to appropriate technology for developing markets using the experience and cultural understanding of engineering teams native to those markets.
Product change driven by compliance with new regulations and environmental standards continues to be a focus of the Company, including the newest diesel engine emission reduction program introduced in Europe, known as Stage V, which is driving further engine emissions related product development. We are active in the development of incorporating alternative power solutions within our different product lines as our customers are seeking out products that operate on battery-electric and fuel-electric hybrid options. Product innovation has become a core element of our growth strategy. We have re-invigorated and increased our emphasis on creating new models and meeting the demands of our customers.  Robust product development pipelines are in place, which we expect will continue to bring new, differentiated products to the market in the years ahead.  We have also focused on producing more cost-effective product solutions across product families, as well as increasing commonalities of components to ease manufacturing processes.
We will continue our commitment to appropriate levels of research, development and engineering spending in order to meet our customer needs, uphold competitive functionality of our products and maintain regulatory compliance in all the markets we serve.

A material portion of AWP net sales are to national rental companies.
PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
We use proprietary materials such as patents, trademarks, trade secrets and trade names in our operations and take actions to protect these rights.
We use several significant trademarks and trade names, most notably the Terex®, Genie®, Powerscreen® and Fuchs® trademarks. The other trademarks and trade names that we use include registered trademarks of Terex Corporation or its subsidiaries. 
We have many patents that we use in connection with our operations and most of our products contain some proprietary technology. Many of these patents and related proprietary technology are important to the production of particular products; however, overall, our patents, taken together, are not material to our business or our overall financial results.
Currently, we are engaged in various legal proceedings with respect to intellectual property rights. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in aggregate, on our business or operating performance. For more detail, see Item 3 – “Legal Proceedings.”
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
As part of The Terex Way, and our Zero Harm Safety and Environmental culture, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our team members, and strive to provide quality products that are safe to use and operate in an environmentally conscious and respectful manner.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking appropriate precautions and implementing safeguards to protect our team members while they continue to meet our customers' needs around the world. We have implemented measures consistent with recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Practices include increased frequency of cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, following social distancing practices, mask usage when distancing practices are not possible and managing safe return to work for those impacted by COVID-19.
We generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. All of our employees are required to obey all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances, should any such events occur. We are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment, machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards. Each of our manufacturing facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every five years to monitor compliance. Also, no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations. We are dedicated to ensuring that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices, training and procedures. We are committed to reducing lost time injuries and working towards a world-class level of safety practices in our industry.
We are dedicated to product safety when designing and manufacturing our equipment. Our equipment is designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in their markets. We continually incorporate safety improvements in our products. We maintain an internal product safety team that is dedicated to improving safety and investigating and resolving any product safety issues that may arise.
Use and operation of our equipment in an environmentally conscious manner is an important priority for us. We are aware of global discussions regarding climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming. We are increasing our production of products that have lower greenhouse gas emissions in response to both regulatory initiatives and anticipated market demand trends. For example, the newest diesel engine emission reduction program introduced in Europe, known as Stage V, is driving further engine emissions related product development. Our segments also offer products that use plug-in electric hybrid technology to save fuel, reduce emissions and reduce noise in residential areas.
Increasing laws and regulations dealing with the environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new forms of equipment that satisfy such new laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations regarding safety and the environment has required, and will continue to require, us to make expenditures. We currently do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
SEASONAL FACTORS
Terex is a globally diverse company, supporting multiple end uses. Seasonality is a factor in some businesses, where annual purchasing patterns are impacted by the seasonality of downstream project spending. Specifically, our businesses can experience stronger demand during the second quarter, as customers in the northern hemisphere make investments in time for the annual construction season (April to October). In 2021, we expect sales to be the highest in the second quarter, and expect our earnings generated in the second half of the year to be slightly higher than the first half of the year.
WORKING CAPITAL
Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding to purchase production and replacement parts inventories, expenditures to repair, replace and upgrade existing facilities, as well as funding to finance receivables from customers and dealers. We have debt service requirements, including semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding notes and periodic interest payments on our bank credit facility and term loans. We believe cash generated from operations, together with availability under our bank credit facility and cash on hand, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. See Item 1A. – “Risk Factors” for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business. We will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities, including reducing costs and working capital, reviewing alternatives for under-utilized assets, and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth opportunities.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
SAFETY
The safety of our team is our number one priority. At Terex, safety is an absolute way of life. We are committed to Zero Harm, and we expect all team members to be committed to safety and continuous improvement in this area. In 2016, Terex set the long-term goals of reaching a 0.2 lost time injury rate and 1.0 total recordable injury rate by 2024. Through the end of 2020, our lost time injury rate has declined from 0.80 to 0.43 and our total recordable injury rate has declined from 3.58 to 1.50. Our aspirational goal will always be zero injuries, but these goals represent milestones along our journey to Zero Harm.
TEAM MEMBER TALENT AND SUPPORT
Terex strives to attract, develop and retain the best people to be part of our team. We have a diverse and highly engaged global workforce. Capable, highly skilled and diverse team members are key to our ability to implement our “Execute, Innovate, Grow” strategy.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,200 team members, including approximately 3,800 team members in the U.S. Approximately one percent of our team members in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. Outside of the U.S., we enter into employment contracts and collective agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. We generally consider our relations with our team members to be good and we provide mechanisms such as surveys and helplines for our team members to provide their perspectives.
We have a robust talent review process in which we assess talent strengths and opportunity areas, matching our team members’ career aspirations with the needs of the business. We offer a wide range of training programs to support team members in their current roles and in achieving advancement opportunities. Our core curriculum of Terex Success Programs are designed for all of our team members from individual contributors to front line supervisors to managers and executives. These programs are grounded in The Terex Way values and help participants build key skills.
We have a strong performance management process that includes annually setting clear business and professional objectives, mid-year calibration, annual performance reviews and succession planning. Both team members and managers play active roles in the performance management process, furthering a culture of accountability that supports team member development.
We design our benefits and programs to support the way our team members live and work. We care about our team members. For example, our Global Employee Assistance Program is in place to support team members who are facing challenges in their personal lives. Where we can, we offer a flexible work environment, enabling team members to manage the demands of their personal and professional lives.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
We are committed to increasing and retaining demographic diversity at all levels of our global workforce. We extend a warm welcome to team members of every race, gender, age, religion, identity or experience. We encourage, value and support non-majority team members in all of our facilities worldwide. We actively seek their engagement and partnership, as we understand that diversity of background, thought and experience leads to improved problem-solving and greater innovation.
Diversity in and of itself is not sufficient. We strive to be fair and impartial in our decisions, ensuring Equity within our workplace. By doing so, we create a sense of Inclusion for all our team members. We are committed to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion so we can make Terex the kind of place where every team member feels valued, listened to, and appreciated.
Our Company has a vibrant, global initiative to increase representation of women in our workplace because we recognize that women are often under-represented in manufacturing organizations such as ours. We are making excellent progress, requiring diverse candidate slates, supporting women through mentoring, training, and colleague-to-colleague education, and using our talent development process to identify qualified women for their next role(s) within our organization. In 2014, we established five-year goals to increase representation in three areas: women in leadership, women in line roles (like operations, engineering and sales) and women overall. Having made progress against these goals, we have extended them for another five years.
In 2020, we committed to expand our primary Diversity, Equity & Inclusion focus areas to include race and ethnicity, to ensure that members of under-represented groups have a sense of belonging and can thrive within our organization. We intentionally defined our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion aspirations, initially focusing on our U.S. workforce.
We have implemented actions to achieve our aspirations, by mobilizing a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Advisory Committee that is focused on training, development, recruitment and inclusion. We have started our training efforts with the Executive Leadership Team to ensure they have a thorough awareness and understanding of systemic racism and unconscious bias. We are developing tools and resources for use at the site level to foster inclusion.
