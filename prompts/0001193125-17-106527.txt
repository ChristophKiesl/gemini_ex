General 
 We are a specialty retailer of home décor and gifts in the United States, operating 404 stores in 36 states as of January 28, 2017, as well as an e-Commerce enabled website, www.kirklands.com. Our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise, including framed art, mirrors, wall décor, candles and related items, lamps, decorative accessories, accent furniture, textiles, garden-related accessories and artificial floral products. Our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise during seasonal periods as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for gift-giving. In addition, we use innovative design and packaging to market home décor items as gifts. We provide our customers an engaging shopping experience characterized by a diverse, ever-changing merchandise selection reflecting current styles at prices which provide discernible value. This combination of ever-changing and stylish merchandise, value pricing and a stimulating online and store experience has led to our emergence as a leader in home décor and enabled us to develop a strong customer base. 
Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to be the leading specialty retailer of home décor and accessories in each of our markets. We believe the following elements of our business strategy both differentiate us from our competitors and position us for growth: 
 Product mix differentiation. While our stores contain items covering a broad range of complementary product categories, we emphasize traditionally-styled, quality merchandise within each category, striving to combine steady-selling, everyday core items with trend-appropriate fashion and seasonal items. Our buyers work closely with our merchandise vendors to identify and develop stylish products that appeal to a broad base of customers while reflecting the latest trends. These products are often proprietary, the result of the development and collaboration between our buyers and our vendors. In most cases, this exclusive merchandise is the result of our buying teams experience in interpreting market and merchandise trends in a way that appeals to our customers. For these reasons, we believe our buying process yields a merchandise assortment that is differentiated from our competition. We also test-market products where appropriate and monitor individual item sales, which enables us to identify and quickly reorder bestselling items in order to maximize sales.
Ever-changing merchandise mix. We believe our ever-changing merchandise mix creates an inviting store environment, encouraging strong customer loyalty and frequent return visits to our stores. The merchandise in our stores is traditionally-styled for broad market appeal, yet it reflects an understanding of our customers desire for fashion and novelty. Our information systems permit close tracking of individual item sales, enabling us to react quickly to both fast-selling and slow-moving items. Accordingly, our inventory turns rapidly and we actively change our merchandise assortment throughout the year in response to market trends, sales results and changes in seasons. We also strategically increase selling space devoted to gifts and seasonal merchandise in advance of holidays. 
 Stimulating store experience. Through our in-store visual presentation, marketing and promotions, and customer service, we seek to make customers feel welcome and at home. Our merchandise presentation effort is geared toward helping our customers visualize our products in their own homes and inspire decorating and gift-giving ideas. We creatively group complementary merchandise throughout the store. We believe this cross-category merchandising encourages customers to browse for longer periods of time, promoting add-on sales. We adjust our visual presentation frequently to take advantage of sales trends, enhance our ever-changing merchandise mix, and support our promotional strategies. Our store associates support this environment through their engagement with our customers, knowledge of our products, and passion for customer service. 
 Strong value proposition. Our customers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for items similar to those sold by other retail stores or through other retail channels. This strategy of providing a combination of style, quality and value is an important element in making Kirklands a destination store. While we carry some items in our stores that sell for several hundred dollars, most items sell for under $20 and are perceived by our customers as very affordable home décor, accessories and gifts. Our longstanding relationships with vendors and our ability to place and sell-through large orders of a single item enhance our ability to attain favorable product pricing from vendors. 
 Broad market appeal. Our stores operate successfully across different geographic regions and market sizes. The flexibility of our concept enables us to select the most promising real estate opportunities that meet requisite economic and demographic criteria within the target markets where our customers live and shop. In addition to our stores, we sell direct-to-customer (DTC) and facilitate orders for in-store pickup (ISP) through our website at www.kirklands.com. We view our e-Commerce channel as a crucial part of our overall business strategy, allowing us to introduce our concept to new customers and complement our brick-and-mortar business for a true omni-channel brand experience.

Brick-and-mortar store growth. With only 404 stores in 36 states as of the end of fiscal 2016, we view expansion of our physical store locations as an opportunity for growth. During fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our total retail square footage by approximately 2% to 3%. We will focus on infill opportunities in some of our core markets, as well as expansion opportunities in under-penetrated markets in the United States such as the Mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, portions of the Northeast, and California. We expect to open 25 to 30 new locations during fiscal 2017, and expect to close approximately 20 locations. The new store openings during fiscal 2017 are expected to be weighted towards the second and third quarters of the year, while closings during fiscal 2017 are expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year. Longer-term, we see an opportunity for meaningful annual square footage growth in both existing and new markets. 
 e-Commerce growth. As customers increasingly turn to the web for their shopping, we expect our e-Commerce channel to provide another growth opportunity. We are continuing to capture additional market share by attracting new customers via the website. We launched third-party drop shipping in fiscal 2015 to give our customers a wider assortment of product offerings. We plan on continued expansion of our third-party drop shipping product offerings in fiscal 2017. Additionally, we are continuing to use the e-Commerce channel to enrich the brick-and-mortar store experience, and have plans to improve our ship to store options to support the blending of the channels into one omni-channel experience. For fiscal 2016, our e-Commerce channel accounted for approximately $47.3 million in revenue, or about 8.0% of our total revenue, a 22.4% increase over fiscal 2015. We expect our e-Commerce business to continue to grow at a pace greater than brick-and-mortar for the foreseeable future, with an interim goal of 10% of the overall business. 
 Merchandising 
 Merchandising strategy. Our merchandising strategy is to (i) offer unique, distinctive and often exclusive, quality home décor products and gifts at affordable prices representing great value to our customers, (ii) maintain a breadth of productive merchandise categories, (iii) provide a carefully edited selection of core items within targeted categories, (iv) emphasize new and fresh-to-market merchandise by continually updating our merchandise mix, and (v) present merchandise in a visually appealing manner to create an inviting atmosphere which inspires decorating and gift-giving ideas and encourages frequent store visits. 
 Our information systems permit close tracking of individual item sales, which enables us to react quickly to market trends and best or slow sellers. This daily sales and product margin information helps us to maximize the productivity of successful products and categories, and minimize the accumulation of slow-moving inventory. The composition of our merchandise assortment is relatively consistent across the chain. We address regional differences where applicable by tailoring inventories to geographic considerations by reviewing specific store sales results in selected categories and classes of product. Our flexible store design and display fixtures allow us to adjust our selling space as needed to capitalize on sales trends. 
 Our average store generally carries approximately 5,200 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). Online we carry approximately 4,100 SKUs, of which 1,400 are exclusively online. We regularly monitor the sell-through on each item; therefore, the number and make-up of our active SKUs is continuously changing based on changes in selling trends. We purchase merchandise from approximately 200 vendors, and our buying team works closely with vendors to differentiate Kirklands merchandise from that of our competitors. For products that are not manufactured specifically for Kirklands, we may create custom packaging as a way to differentiate our merchandise offering and reinforce our brand. Exclusive or proprietary products distinguish us from our competition, enhance the value of our merchandise and provide the opportunity to improve our net sales and gross margin. 
 Product assortment. Our major merchandise categories include wall décor, art, mirrors, lamps, decorative accessories, accent furniture, textiles, fragrance and accessories, frames, housewares, impulse and personal accessories, outdoor living, and artificial floral products. Our stores also offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise, as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for gift-giving.

 Value proposition. We continually strive to increase the perceived value of Kirklands products to our customers through our distinctive merchandising, carefully coordinated in-store signage, visual presentation and product packaging. Our shoppers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for items similar to those sold by other retail stores, through catalogs, or on the Internet. Our stores typically have two major semi-annual sale events, one in January and one in July. We also use temporary promotions throughout the year featuring specific items or categories of merchandise. We believe our value-oriented pricing strategy, coupled with an adherence to high quality standards, is an important element in establishing our distinct brand identity and solidifying our connection with our customers. 
 Buying and Inventory Management 
 Merchandise sourcing and product development. Our merchandise team purchases inventory on a centralized basis to take advantage of our consolidated buying power and our technology to closely control the merchandise mix in our stores. Our buying team selects all of our products, negotiates with vendors and works closely with our planning and allocation team to optimize store-level merchandise quantity and mix by category, classification and item. 
 Approximately 84% of our total purchases are from importers of merchandise manufactured primarily in China and other South-Asian countries, with the balance purchased from domestic manufacturers and wholesalers. For our purchases of merchandise manufactured abroad, we have historically bought from importers or U.S.-based representatives of foreign manufacturers rather than dealing directly with foreign manufacturers. This process has enabled us to maximize flexibility and minimize product liability and credit risks. 
 Planning and allocation. Our merchandise planning and allocation team works closely with our buying team, field management and store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities. This team also manages inventory levels, allocates merchandise to stores and replenishes inventory based upon information generated by our information systems. Our inventory control systems monitor current inventory levels at each store, by operating district, and for the total Company. We also continually monitor recent selling history within each store by category, classification and item to properly allocate future purchases to maximize sales and gross margin. 
 Each of our stores is internally classified for merchandising purposes based on certain criteria including sales volume, size, location and historical performance. Although our stores carry similar merchandise, the variety and depth of products in a given store may vary depending on the stores rank and classification. Where applicable, inventory purchases and allocation are also tailored based on regional or demographic differences between stores in selected categories. 
 Store Operations 
 General. In addition to corporate management and three Regional Directors, approximately 30 Multi-Unit Managers (who generally have responsibility for an average of 14 stores within a geographic district) manage store operations. A Store Manager and one to three Assistant Managers manage individual stores. The Store Manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, 
 
6 
 
 including sales, customer service, merchandise display, human resource functions and store security. A typical store operates seven days a week with an average of 12 to 16 employees, including a combination of full and part-time employees, depending on the volume of the store and the season. Additional part-time employees are typically hired to assist with increased traffic and sales volume in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. 
 Merchandise presentation. Merchandise is generally displayed according to guidelines and directives given to each store from the Merchandise Presentation team with input from Store Operations. This procedure promotes somewhat uniform display standards throughout the chain depending upon store configuration. Using multiple types of fixtures, we group complementary merchandise creatively throughout the store, and also display certain products strictly by category or product type. 
 Because of the nature of our merchandise and our focus on identifying and developing best-selling items, we emphasize our merchandise presentation standards. Our Merchandise Presentation team provides Store Managers with recommended directives such as photographs, diagrams and placement guides. Augmenting this centralized approach, each Store Manager has flexibility to creatively highlight those products that are expected to have the greatest appeal to local shoppers. Effective and consistent visual merchandising enhances a stores ability to reach its full sales potential. 
 Personnel recruitment and training. We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate quality employees. In particular, our success depends on our ability to promote and/or recruit qualified Multi-Unit and Store Managers and maintain quality full-time and part-time employees. Multi-Unit Managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new Store Managers. Store Managers are responsible for the hiring and training of new associates, assisted where appropriate by a Human Resources Manager. We constantly look for motivated and talented people to promote from within Kirklands, in addition to recruiting outside Kirklands. All employees are trained utilizing the K University training program. Store Managers train at a designated training store where they work directly with a qualified Training Store Manager. Multi-Unit Managers onboard at our Corporate office in addition to spending time with designated Senior Multi-Unit Manager Trainers. 
 Compensation and incentives. Multi-Unit and Store Managers are compensated with a base salary plus periodic bonuses based on performance. Sales associates are compensated on an hourly basis. In addition, we periodically run a variety of contests that reward associates for outstanding achievement in sales and other corporate initiatives. 
 Real Estate 
 Strategy. Our real estate strategy is to identify dominant retail properties that are convenient and attractive to our target customer. The flexibility and broad appeal of our stores and our merchandise allow us to operate successfully in major metropolitan markets such as Houston, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia; middle markets such as Nashville, Tennessee and Kansas City, Missouri; and smaller markets such as Palmdale, California and Amarillo, Texas. As we execute our store growth strategy, we are focused on infill opportunities in some of our existing markets as well as expansion opportunities in under-penetrated markets in the United States such as the Mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, portions of the Northeast, and California to provide us with the unit growth to achieve our goals. 
 Formats. We operate stores in a variety of off-mall venues and enclosed malls. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 27 stores in enclosed malls, of which 16 were outward-facing, and 377 stores in off-mall venues. Off-mall stores included 333 in power strip centers and lifestyle centers, 14 in outlet centers and 30 freestanding locations. The average size of the new stores we opened in fiscal 2016 was approximately 8,200 square feet, and we currently expect our fiscal 2017 new stores to be primarily in off-mall shopping centers of similar average size. 
 Site selection. Our site selection strategy is to locate our stores in venues which are destinations for large numbers of shoppers and which reinforce our image and brand. To assess potential new locations, we review financial and demographic criteria and infrastructure for access. We also analyze the quality and relative location of co-tenants and competitive factors, square footage availability, frontage space and other relevant criteria to determine the overall acceptability of a property and the optimal locations within it. 
 The following table provides a history of our store openings and closings for the last five fiscal years: 
 

 | Fiscal2016 | | | Fiscal2015 | | Fiscal2014 | Fiscal2013 | | Fiscal2012 |

Distribution and Logistics 
 We have implemented a comprehensive approach to the management of our merchandise supply chain. This approach encompasses all parts of the supply chain, from the manufacturer overseas to the store selling floor. Our 771,000 square-foot distribution center in Jackson, Tennessee has a warehouse management system and material handling equipment that streamline the flow of goods within the distribution center. To support our e-Commerce growth, we entered into a three-year lease in March 2015 for an additional 303,000 square-foot facility in Jackson, Tennessee which began serving as the fulfillment center for e-Commerce in March 2016. We continue to evaluate the impact of our omni-channel strategies on our business, and are currently implementing enhancements to our supply chain infrastructure and warehouse management system to support our store unit growth and e-Commerce goals. 
 In fiscal 2016, we implemented a new west coast distribution operation, which provides for better flow of merchandise through our supply chain network. By virtue of this operation, we also gain control of inventory earlier, which expands our options for future store and e-Commerce fulfillment capabilities. 
 We currently utilize third-party carriers to transport merchandise from our distribution center to our stores. Approximately 97% of our stores utilize direct, full truckload deliveries, which results in lower distribution costs and allows our field personnel to better schedule store associates for the receiving process. The optimal delivery method for a given store depends on the stores sales volume, square footage, geographic location and other factors. 
 Information Systems 
 We have invested considerable resources in our management information systems to manage the purchase, pricing and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations. Our key management information systems include a merchandise management system, point-of-sale system, an e-Commerce platform, an e-Commerce order management system, a warehouse management system, a financial system and a labor management tool. Our merchandise management system provides us with tools to manage aspects of our merchandise assortment and integrates all merchandising and inventory management applications including inventory tracking, purchase order management, merchandise financial planning, allocation, and replenishment and sales audit and ultimately interfaces with our financial system. 
 We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance. We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements. We continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store, distribution facility and omni-channel expansion. These efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business. 
 Marketing 
 Although our overall marketing efforts encompass various techniques, in recent years, we have had a significant focus on e-mail communication. We now manage a database of approximately 3.2 million active e-mail addresses that have been provided by our customers, primarily through in-store collection processes and various contests and initiatives designed to drive e-mail sign-ups. We use this database to communicate frequently with our loyal customer base about new products, in-store events and special offers. We are continuously evaluating other forms of advertising as we seek to further enhance the visibility of our products and our brands. Our marketing efforts inside the store emphasize signage, store and window banners, displays and other techniques to attract customers and provide an exciting shopping experience. The growth of our e-Commerce business has also increased our investment in online marketing channels such as paid search and affiliate marketing. 
 We have a customer loyalty program, K Club, which allows us to reward customers based on dollars spent on eligible purchases with certificates towards future purchases. In addition to the K Club, we provide our customers with the option to utilize Kirklands private-label credit card. This program is administered by a third-party, who bears the credit risk associated with the card program without recourse to us. Customers using the Kirklands private-label credit card visit our stores and purchase merchandise more frequently, as well as spend more money per visit, than our customers not using the card. 
 Internet and Social Media 
 We believe the Internet offers opportunities to complement our brick-and-mortar stores, increase sales and increase consumer brand awareness of our products. Our website at www.kirklands.com provides our customers with the ability to purchase Kirklands merchandise online and have it delivered directly to their homes or their nearest Kirklands store. Customers may also use the website as a resource to locate a store, preview our merchandise, join our K Club loyalty program, apply for a Kirklands credit card, and purchase gift cards online. We are also very active in social media and maintain a presence on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram.

Trademarks 
 All of our stores operate under the names Kirklands, Kirklands Home, Kirklands Home Outlet, Kirklands Outlet, and The Kirkland Collection. 
 We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register that are used in connection with the Kirklands stores, including KIRKLANDS® logo design, KIRKLANDS®, THE KIRKLAND COLLECTION®, KIRKLANDS OUTLET®, KIRKLANDS HOME®, MARKET AND VINEtm and LOVE THE POSSIBILITIES, LOVE THE PRICE®. These marks have historically been important components in our merchandising and marketing strategy. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States. 
Competition 
 The retail market for home décor and gifts is highly competitive. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and Internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Some of our main competitors include HomeGoods, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. Department stores typically have higher prices than our stores for similar merchandise. Specialty retailers tend to have higher prices and a narrower assortment of home décor products. Wholesale clubs may have lower prices than our stores, but the product assortment is generally more limited. We believe that the principal competitive factors influencing our business are merchandise selection, price, customer service, visual appeal of the merchandise and the store, and the convenience of our store locations. The number of companies offering a selection of home décor products that overlaps generally with our product assortment has increased over the last 10 to 15 years. We believe we compete effectively with other retailers due to our experience in identifying a broad collection of distinctive merchandise, pricing it to be attractive to the target Kirklands customer, presenting it in a visually appealing manner, and providing a quality shopping experience. 
 In addition to competing for customers, we compete with other retailers for suitable store locations and qualified management personnel and sales associates. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K, captioned Risk Factors. 
 Employees 
 We employed approximately 7,900 employees as of January 28, 2017. The number of employees fluctuates with seasonal needs. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a positive relationship with our employees. 
Seasonality 
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results, which are typical of many specialty retailers and common to most retailers generally. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year. 
 Availability of SEC Reports 
 We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Members of the public may read and copy materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Members of the public may also obtain information on the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including Kirklands, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those documents and other information filed by us with the SEC are available, without charge, on our Internet web site, http://www.kirklands.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC. Copies are also available, without charge, by written request to: Secretary, Kirklands, Inc., 5310 Maryland Way, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027.
