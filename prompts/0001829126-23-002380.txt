General Description of Business
 
Structure
 
Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. (“Lightstone REIT II”), which was formerly known as Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. before September 16, 2021, is a Maryland corporation formed on April 28, 2008, which elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2009.
 
Lightstone REIT II is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LP (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership formed on April 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2022, we held a 99% general partnership interest in our Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
Lightstone REIT II and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to Lightstone REIT II, our Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
Through our Operating Partnership, we own, operate commercial properties and make real estate-related investments. Since our inception, we have primarily acquired and operated commercial hospitality properties, principally consisting of limited-service-hotels all located in the United States. However, our commercial holdings may also consist of full-service hotels, and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. Our real estate investments are held by us alone or jointly with other parties. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly. Although most of our investments are these types, we may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests. We evaluate all of our real estate investments as one operating segment. We currently intend to hold our investments until such time as we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we (i) majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 12 limited-service hotels containing a total of 1,582 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated 48.6% membership interest in Brownmill, LLC (the “Brownmill Joint Venture”), an affiliated entity that owns two retail properties, and (iii) held an unconsolidated 50.0% membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”), an affiliated real estate entity that owns and operates a 183-room limited-service hotel located in Long Island City, New York (the “Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City”). We account for our membership interests in the Brownmill Joint Venture and the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting.
 
The Brownmill Joint Venture owns two retail properties known as Browntown Shopping Center, located in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and Millburn Mall, located in Vauxhaull, New Jersey. The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture owns a 183-room, limited-service hotel (the “Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City) located in the Long Island City neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City. Both the Brownmill Joint Venture and the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are between us and related parties.
 
As of December 31, 2022, seven of our consolidated limited-service hotels are held in LVP Holdco JV LLC (the “Hotel Joint Venture”), a joint venture formed between us and Lightstone Value Plus REIT I, Inc. (“Lightstone REIT I”), a related party REIT also sponsored by The Lightstone Group, LLC. We and Lightstone REIT I have 97.5% and 2.5% membership interests in the Hotel Joint Venture, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, one of our consolidated hotels also has ownership interests held by unrelated minority owners. The membership interests of Lightstone REIT I and the unrelated minority owners are accounted for as noncontrolling interests. 
 
See Item 2. Properties for additional information on our consolidated and unconsolidated properties.

Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On May 20, 2008, the Advisor contributed $2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. Our Advisor also owns 20,000 shares of common stock (“Common Shares”) which were issued on May 20, 2008 for $200, or $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of The Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as the sponsor (the “Sponsor”) during our initial public offering (the “Offering”) and follow-on offering (the “Follow-On Offering”, and collectively, the “Offerings”), which terminated on August 15, 2012 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Our Advisor, pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, together with our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), is primarily responsible for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Associate General Partner”), which owns 177.0 subordinated profits interests (“Subordinated Profits Interests”) in the Operating Partnership which were acquired for aggregate consideration of $17.7 million in connection with our Offerings. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT II or the Operating Partnership.
 
We have no employees. The Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including asset management, accounting, legal, and property management, as well as investor relations services.
 
Our Advisor has affiliates which may manage certain of the properties we acquire. However, we also contract with other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties.
 
Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our Common Shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading.
 
On January 17, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement to our charter pursuant to which we are no longer required to either (a) amend our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) hold a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
Noncontrolling Interests – Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
Limited Partner
 
On May 20, 2008, our Advisor contributed $2 to our Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner common units in our Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert limited partner common units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our Common Shares.
Associate General Partner
 
In connection with our Offerings, the Associate General Partner contributed an aggregate of $17.7 million consisting of (i) cash of $12.9 million and (ii) equity interests totaling 48.6% in the Brownmill Joint Venture, which were valued at $4.8 million, to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 177.0 Subordinated Profits Interests in the Operating Partnership with an aggregate value of $17.7 million. As the majority owner of the Associate General Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99% interest in such Subordinated Profits Interests and thus receives an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof.
 
These Subordinated Profits Interests may entitle the Associate General Partner to a portion of any regular distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. There have been no distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests for any periods after December 31, 2019. Since our inception through December 31, 2022, the cumulative distributions declared and paid on the Subordinated Profits Interests were $7.9 million. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Profits Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return.
 
The Subordinated Profits Interests may also entitle Lightstone SLP II, LLC to a portion of any liquidating distributions made by the Operating Partnership. The value of such distributions will depend upon the net sale proceeds upon the liquidation of the Company and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. Liquidating distributions to Lightstone SLP II, LLC will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return.
 
Other Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries
 
Other noncontrolling interests consist of the (i) membership interest in the Hotel Joint Venture held by Lightstone REIT I and (ii) membership interests held by minority owners in one of our hotels.

Related Parties
 
Our Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates, including the Special Limited Partner, are related parties of ours as well as other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement of costs incurred for services related to the investment, development, management and disposition of our assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements.
Primary Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. We intend to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.
Investment Strategy and Policies
 
We have and expect to continue to invest in commercial properties (including full-service or limited-service hotels, extended-stay hotels and retail properties) and residential properties, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Limited-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels are associated. We generally intend to hold each acquired property until its investment objectives are met or it is likely they will not be met.
 
Even though we have and expect to continue primarily to acquire hotels, we have and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We have and expect to continue to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, we may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
 
We have and expect to continue to enter into joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our Advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.
 
Tax Status and Income Taxes
 
We elected to be taxed and qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), including when we acquire a hotel we usually establish a TRS and enter into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no material uncertain income tax positions.
 
Current Environment
 
Our operating results and financial condition are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and uncertainty as a result of recent banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession.
 
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, certain labor and supply chain challenges, developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other changes in economic conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.
 
Competition 

The hotel market is highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we are not associated.
 
We have or may compete with other commercial real estate owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of our properties.
 
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay investments, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability make distributions to stockholders.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of investments and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing owners the opportunity to contribute properties to Lightstone REIT II in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.

Regulations
 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, and environmental matters. We believe that we have or will obtain all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
