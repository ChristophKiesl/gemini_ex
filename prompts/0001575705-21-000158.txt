HempOverview Platform
 
Domestic Hemp Production and Prevailing Regulatory Changes
 
With the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill in December 2018, industrial hemp is now recognized as an agricultural commodity, such as corn, wheat, or soybeans.
 
More specifically, the 2018 Farm Bill authorizes state departments of agriculture, including agencies representing the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any other territory or possession of the United States, and Indian tribal governments, to submit plans to the USDA applying for primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in their respective state or tribal territory. For more information on state and tribal nation plan submission, please visit https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/state-and-tribal-plan-review. 
 
As of February 12, 2021, 23 states and 40 tribal nations have had their hemp production plans approved by the USDA, and 20 states will continue to operate their hemp production plans in accordance with the 2014 pilot guidelines issued by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which handles the extramural research aspects of industrial hemp cultivation.
 
Market Opportunity in U.S. Industrial Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD
 
After a tumultuous first two years of legal hemp farming in the United States, many market participants are anticipating that the 2021 planting season will take on a more settled character, bringing some routine and less confusion to growing, harvesting and marketing efforts. In its January 2021 report titled Hemp 2021: Industry Insiders Offer Projections for the Year, Hemp Benchmark noted that some industry leaders believe this year could be a strong one for hemp as the crop becomes more integrated into the workings of America’s agriculture sector. 
 
In its February 2020 market forecast report (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-industrial- hemp-market), Grand View Research stated that the global industrial hemp market will reach $15.26 billion by 2027, up from $5.33 billion in 2020. According to the report, an increased focus on selecting low-THC hemp varieties, using developed cultivation and processing equipment, providing technical support for growers, and establishing contracts with farmers, all play significant roles in achieving major market share. Grand View expects that increased awareness of the dietary advantages of hemp oil and growing demand for hemp-derived CBD from the cosmetics and personal care industries will help fuel market growth, along with the introduction of conducive regulations for the cultivation and use of hemp-based CBD products in the United States over the forecast period. 
 
HempOverview
 
As one of the agriculture industry’s leading pioneers of advanced aerial-image-based data collection and analytics solutions, AgEagle is intent on leveraging our expertise to champion the use of proven, advanced web- and map-based technologies as a means to streamline and ultimately standardize hemp cultivation in the United States. Growers need to be registered/permitted; crops need to be monitored and inspected; and enforcement operations must be established to ensure compliance with state and federal mandates. Through the introduction of HempOverview, we believe that AgEagle represents the first agriculture technology company to bring to market an advanced agtech solution that is designed to meet the unique complexities and vigorous oversight, compliance and enforcement demands of the emerging American hemp industry and the unique needs and demands of its key stakeholders.
 
HempOverview is comprised of four modules:
 

1) | Registration: secure, scalable software to handle all farmer and processer application and licensing matters. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Best Management Practices: iterative, intelligent data collection and analysis utilizing satellite imagery and advanced, proprietary algorithms to help farmers reduce input costs, avoid missteps, detect pest impacts and monitor water usage.
3) | Oversight and Enforcement: integration of data management and satellite imagery to provide continuous monitoring of all hemp fields in the state, predict and respond to issues and assist in proper crop testing.

In November 2019, AgEagle announced that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services chose the HempOverview solution to manage its online application submission and registration process for hemp growers and their farms and hemp fields in the State of Florida for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Subsequent to the end of 2020, the Company announced that the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship also licensed the HempOverview platform to manage the state’s online registration, payment processing, comprehensive data collection and compliance oversight for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 planting seasons.
 
HempOverview has also been created to support hemp processors who contract with growers, helping to ensure profitable production on existing contracted acres while maintaining governmental compliance in a changing regulatory landscape. More specifically, HempOverview supports full, cloud-based mobile- and desktop-based software application and enables users to:
 

● | Maintain oversight of the supply chain for a processor’s contracted acres in order to avoid costly errors resulting in lost crop(s) and/or inefficient production downtime; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Create metrics and regularly evaluate contracted acres, in near real-time, using a variety of data structures, including remote sensing, in-field monitoring, harvest estimation and comprehensive reporting functions;
● | Advise contract farmers on planting, fertilization, irrigation and harvest schedules with the goal of producing a “gold standard” hemp crop; and 
● | Establish best practices, maintain compliance and properly file all registration documents and amendments with respective state regulatory bodies. 

 
HempOverview focuses on simultaneously collecting data, analyzing field-related problems, and providing readily accessible analysis and reporting for achieving and sustaining end-to-end visibility and best management practices for the growing industrial and CBD hemp supply chain.
 
Drone Manufacturing
 
Our Proprietary Fixed-Wing Drones
 
The Company’s first commercially available product was the AgEagle Classic, which was followed shortly thereafter by the RAPID System. As we improved and evolved our product, we launched the RX-60 and subsequently our current UAV product, the RX-48. The success AgEagle has achieved with its legacy products, which the Company believes has carried over into the continued improvement of the RX-60 and RX-48, stems from AgEagle’s ability to invent and deliver advanced solutions utilizing its proprietary technologies and trade secrets that help farmers, agronomists and other precision agricultural professionals operate more effectively and efficiently.
 
The Company’s core technological capabilities, developed over five years of research and innovation, include a lightweight laminated shell that allows the UAV platform to perform under challenging flying conditions, a camera with a Near Infrared (NIR) filter, a rugged foot launcher (RX-60), and high-end software that automates drone flights and provides geo-referenced data. AgEagle’s products were designed for busy agriculture professionals who do not have the time to process images on their computers, which some of its competitors require. The software can automatically take pictures from the camera, stitch the photos together through the cloud, and deliver a geo-referenced, high quality aerial map to the user’s desktop or tablet device using specialty precision agriculture software such as SST Software, SMS Software or most other agricultural software solutions. The result is a prescription or zone map that can then be used in a field computer that is typically found in a sprayer or applicator designed to drive through fields to precisely apply the amount of nutrients or chemicals required to continue or restore the production of healthy crops. The Company’s management believes that these characteristics make its UAVs well suited for providing a complete aerial view of a farmer’s field to help precisely identify crop health and field conditions faster than any other method available.

Relocation to Wichita 
 
In November 2020, AgEagle relocated its headquarters and drone manufacturing and assembly operations from Neodesha, Kansas to Wichita, Kansas, widely known as the “Air Capital of the World.” Home to several of the world’s great aviation brands, Wichita was ranked by Brookings Institution (source: https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/ uploads/2016/07/Wichita-2.pdf) as having the #1 skilled workforce in the nation, providing us with direct access to world class engineering and aeronautical talent. In addition, the decision to move to Wichita was further buoyed by the region’s low-cost real estate advantages and high quality of life for our workforce. 
 
Our newly leased 12,000 square foot facility provides AgEagle with ample capacity to materially scale our contract manufacturing business, while also providing the space necessary to house our administrative offices, design and engineering teams and testing operations. 
 
Demand for Drones “Made in America”
 
For the past several years, security experts have expressed concerns that UAVs made in China or other adversarial countries could be used to spy on U.S. interest by exfiltration of data back to the country of origin. In fact, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert that drones are a potential risk to an organization’s information. 
 
Data released by Drone Industry Insights in late 2019 revealed that China-based Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) accounted for about 70% of all drone sales worldwide – and up to 80% of the U.S. market (Source: https://droneii.com/product/chinese- drone-market-report). Citing the threat of Chinese manufacturers, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced in January 2021 that it will no longer include drones in its suite of offerings as of February 1, 2021 (Source: https://interact.gsa.gov/blog/removal-drones-gsa-multiple-award-schedule-contracts). The Department of Justice also recently banned the use of agency grants to purchase drones and other unmanned aerial systems from foreign groups; and the federal government is not likely to stop these limited policy bans. Congress has already taken steps to check DJI’s ability to operate in the U.S. and it is considering more. It effectively cemented the Defense Department’s ban into law in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020. Congress has also considered broader bans, such as the draft American Security Drone Act, which would bar any federal agency from acquiring Chinese drones or drones made with Chinese components; and would also codify the different policy prohibitions on using federal grant money to buy Chinese drones and components – an aspect of the law clearly aimed at curbing use of the technology at the state and local levels. 
 
AgEagle believes that these measures to ban China-manufactured drones and components has and will continue to fuel demand for “Made in America” drones and components, creating a significant opportunity for U.S.-based drone manufacturers, like AgEagle. Consequently, it is our intention to establish best industry practices and define quality standards for manufacturing, assembly, design/engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita facility.
 
We will pursue a lean and efficient production strategy across our business, focusing on rapid prototyping, supply chain management, integration, quality and final acceptance testing. We will work to optimize our own proprietary and customers’ designs to meet scalable manufacturing requirements, mission capabilities and equipment specifications. Within this framework, we expect to develop products with feedback and input from manufacturing, quality, supply chain managers, key suppliers, logistics personnel and our customers. We will incorporate this input into product designs in an effort to maximize efficiencies and quality of our products, while minimizing time to market. As a result, we believe that we will achieve a reduction in time required to move a product from its design phase to full scale production deliveries while achieving high reliability, quality, and safety yields.
 
It is noteworthy to add that we have forged strong relationships with key suppliers in the U.S. and in U.S.-allied countries based on their ability to meet our needs and delivery timelines. We will continue to expand upon our suppliers’ expertise to improve our existing products and develop new solutions. In 2020, we experienced some supply chain delays due primarily to logistical issues relating to COVID-19 shutdown mandates. Unfortunately, we do anticipate encountering potential delays in 2021.

Contract Manufacturing for Commercial Drone Package Delivery
 
Over the past year, there has been a surge of prominent companies, including Alphabet (Google), FedEx, Intel, Qualcomm, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Alibaba, UPS, 7-Eleven, Uber and many others, actively developing commercial drone delivery service initiatives as part of their long-term strategic plans. These companies intend to leverage the latest in UAV technologies to deliver food, consumer products, medicines, and other types of lightweight freight direct to consumers and businesses in the fastest, most cost efficient and environmentally responsible manner possible – a practical alternative to costly auto transport. It is believed that AgEagle’s proven expertise in manufacturing rugged, reliable and professional grade UAVs makes the Company a logical partner for designing, manufacturing and testing drone platforms in this fast growing package delivery market.
 
In 2020, AgEagle’s annual revenue was mostly derived from contracted manufacturing work completed for a major ecommerce company, which engaged the Company to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry goods in urban and suburban areas along with ground support equipment used for the testing and refining of client’s commercial drone small delivery vehicles, systems and operations currently in development. This customer chose to team with AgEagle due in large measure to our proven expertise in drone design and innovation.
 
In October 2020, we expanded our contract manufacturing customer base to include Valqari, with which we entered into a two-year agreement, exclusive in North America, to produce Valqari’s patented Drone Delivery Station. This station is the only solution that has solved the “last inch” logistic problems associated with drone deliveries and allows for an entirely automated and safe drone package delivery. We believe that effective solutions for ground support, like Valqari’s Drone Delivery Station, will prove to be a vital, fundamental component of the new drone delivery ecosystem, helping to ensure the promising potential of mainstream drone package delivery is fully realized.
 
With plans to expand our in-house business development team in 2021, we are actively engaged in identifying and pursuing additional opportunities for AgEagle to develop and strengthen our customer base and/or strategic business partnerships and materially ramp annual revenue generation from our design and engineering, contract manufacturing, assembly and testing services.

BEYOND Program- Integrating UAVs into National Airspace
 
In November 2020, AgEagle was selected as an industry partner in the next phase of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (US DOT) Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (IPP), known as the BEYOND program. The original IPP was launched through a Presidential Memorandum in October 2017 with nine regional participants. The IPP participants and their industry partners used innovative strategies to craft successful safety cases to operate drones under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) existing regulations. On October 30, 2020, the US DOT announced that the three-year IPP successfully concluded on October 25, 2020. In the release, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios noted, “The IPP propelled the American drone industry forward, allowing for unprecedented expansions in testing and operations through innovative private-public partnerships across the country. Now, the BEYOND program will build upon this success, tackling the next big challenges facing drone integration.”
 
Eight of the nine state, local and tribal governments that participated in the original program signed new agreements with the FAA to participate in the BEYOND program, including the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). AgEagle was selected by KDOT to serve as an industry partner in the BEYOND program to help solve key challenges including:
 

● | Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations that are repeatable, scalable and economically viable with specific emphasis on infrastructure inspection, public operations and small package delivery;

On December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules for drones that will require Remote Identification (Remote ID) of drones and allow operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. In the related press release (https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541), U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao stated, “These final rules carefully address safety, security and privacy concerns while advancing opportunities for innovation and utilization of drone technology.”
 
The Remote ID rule applies to all operators of drones that require FAA registration. There are three ways to comply with the operational requirements:
 

1. | Operate a standard Remote ID drone that broadcasts identification and location information of the drone and control station; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Operate a drone with a Remote ID broadcast module (may be a separate device attached to the drone), which broadcasts identification, location, and take-off information; or
3. | Operate a drone without Remote ID but at specific FAA-recognized identification areas. 

 
The Operations Over People and at Night rule applies to Part 107 operators. The ability to fly over people and moving vehicles varies depending on the level of risk a small drone operation presents to people on the ground. Operations are permitted based on four categories, which can be found in the executive summary accompanying the rule. Additionally, this rule allows for operations at night under certain conditions. For additional information regarding these and other FAA rules relating to UAS operations, please visit www.faa.gov.
 
Domestic Hemp Cultivation Regulation
 
The 2018 Farm Bill directed the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to establish a national regulatory framework for hemp production in the United States. The USDA established the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program through an interim final rule outlining provisions for the USDA to approve plans submitted by States and Indian Tribes for the domestic production of hemp. It also established a Federal plan for producers in States or territories of Indian tribes that do not have their own USDA-approved plan. The program includes provisions for maintaining information on the land where hemp is produced, testing the levels of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, disposing of plants not meeting necessary requirements, licensing requirements and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Rule. For more information on state and tribal nation plan submission, please visit https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/state-and-tribal-plan-review. 
 
As of February 12, 2021, 23 states and 40 tribal nations have had their hemp production plans approved by the USDA, and 20 states will continue to operate their hemp production plans in accordance with the 2014 pilot guidelines issued by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which handles the extramural research aspects of industrial hemp cultivation.
 
AgEagle has developed HempOverview to provide users with a gold industry standard for fully complying with federal, state and tribal regulations associated with hemp cultivation.
 
Manufacturing
 
As of today, we manufacture and assemble all our proprietary and customers’ drone systems and solutions at our manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas.
 
Suppliers
 
In 2020, we maintained strong relationships established with companies that provide many of the parts and services necessary to construct our advanced fixed wing drones, such as Botlink and MicaSense. On January 26, 2021, , the Company and AgEagle Sensor Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Buyer”), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “MicaSense Purchase Agreement”) with Parrot Drones S.A.S. and Justin B. McAllister (the “Sellers”) pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MicaSense, Inc. (“MicaSense”) from the Sellers. The transaction closed on January 27, 2021. MicaSense manufactures and sells drone sensors for vegetation mapping and other drone applications. As our Company grows, we expect to pursue additional supplier relationships from which we can source less costly and better supplies to stay ahead of the needs of the market.

Our flight planning and photo stitching software is provided by Pix4D and flight planning is QGroundControl, an open-source application. We have worked closely with software partners to optimize their software to work with our platform. We consider our relationships with Pix4D to be good; however, a loss of this relationship would have a short-term adverse effect on our product offerings and results of operations, as we look to an alternative provider for our photo stitching software.
