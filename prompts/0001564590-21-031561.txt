Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative ways to test within established markets. Our initial focus is on blood grouping and donor disease screening, which is commonly referred to as transfusion diagnostics. Blood grouping involves specific procedures performed at donor or patient testing laboratories to characterize blood, which includes antigen typing and antibody detection. Disease screening involves the screening of donor blood for unwanted pathogens using two different methods, a serological approach (testing for specific antigens or antibodies) and a molecular approach (testing for DNA or RNA). We believe that MosaiQ, our proprietary technology platform, may also have application beyond transfusion diagnostics in the larger clinical diagnostics market where testing currently performed using separate immunoassay and molecular testing techniques for a single diagnosis could be combined on one testing technology permitting multiple tests simultaneously with a simplified workflow.
 We have over 35 years of experience developing, manufacturing and commercializing conventional reagent products used for blood grouping within the global transfusion diagnostics market. We are developing MosaiQ to better address the comprehensive needs of this large and established market. MosaiQ will initially comprise two separate microarrays, one for immunohematology (blood grouping), or IH, and one for serological disease screening, or SDS, and a high-throughput instrument. We are also developing a third microarray for molecular disease screening. We believe MosaiQ has the potential to transform transfusion diagnostics, significantly reducing the cost of blood testing in the donor and patient testing environments, while improving patient outcomes. 
 We have designed MosaiQ to offer a breadth of diagnostic tests that is unmatched by existing commercially available transfusion diagnostic instrument platforms. Time to result for MosaiQ is expected to be significantly quicker than existing methods for extended antigen typing and antibody detection and is expected to be equivalent to the time to result for current instrument platforms performing basic antigen typing. We believe that customer adoption of MosaiQ will lead to improved patient outcomes through better and easier matching of donor and patient blood, given cost-effective extended antigen typing offered by MosaiQ. Improved patient outcomes using MosaiQ include the potential for reduced incidence of alloimmunization, where the patient develops antibodies to foreign antigens introduced to the body through transfused blood. Cost savings and efficiencies should also be available to customers that adopt MosaiQ, as a result of: 
  
• | consolidation of multiple instrument platforms in donor testing laboratories;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | automation, which will help to address shortages of skilled technicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | better workflow, which will lead to a better cost position, addressing budget constraints;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comprehensive characterization of donor or patient blood, eliminating the need for routine manual testing typically undertaken by skilled technicians; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | higher throughput and productivity per square meter.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 We have designed MosaiQ to match the existing performance of automated platforms used by donor testing laboratories for serological disease screening. We also believe the incorporation of molecular disease screening on MosaiQ will offer considerable advantages over existing approaches in use by donor testing laboratories, delivering operational cost savings and a reduced time to result, while also eliminating the need to pool samples.
 Our initial aim is to provide donor testing laboratories with a single instrument platform to be utilized for blood grouping and, if applicable, both serological and molecular disease screening for donated red blood cells and plasma. Based on historical annual blood donations collected by our key target donor testing customers, we estimate that the potential market for MosaiQ microarrays (for blood grouping, serological disease screening and molecular disease screening) should exceed 100 million microarrays per annum following receipt of applicable regulatory clearances and approvals for MosaiQ. 
 We also believe that MosaiQ may have the potential for use beyond transfusion diagnostics in the larger clinical diagnostics market, and are evaluating the potential for our technology as a platform for diagnosis and monitoring of other disease states. We have identified opportunities for future partnership and development in relation to disease states for which a broad array of tests are required using multiple testing modalities for a single diagnosis or for ongoing therapy monitoring.

We have a proven track record and significant expertise in product development, manufacturing and quality assurance, tailored to the highly regulated transfusion diagnostics market. We currently derive revenue from a portfolio of products used for blood grouping, as well as whole blood controls used daily for quality assurance testing of third-party blood grouping instruments. We have introduced a range of FDA-licensed products in the United States under the Quotient brand, which we sell directly to donor testing laboratories, hospitals and independent patient testing laboratories. We also develop, manufacture and sell conventional reagent products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, such as Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (or Ortho), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (or Bio-Rad) and Grifols S.A. (or Grifols). In July and December 2019, the FDA licensed a range of conventional reagent products developed and manufactured by us for use on instrument platforms commercialized by Ortho.
 From our incorporation in 2012 to March 31, 2021, we have raised $160.0 million of gross proceeds through the private placement of our ordinary and preference shares and warrants, $433.0 million of gross proceeds from public offerings of our ordinary shares and issuances of ordinary shares upon exercise of warrants and $145.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of 12% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (which we refer to as the Secured Notes). In addition, on March 23, 2018, we raised $20.9 million from the sale and leaseback of our recently completed conventional reagents manufacturing facility near Edinburgh, Scotland, which we refer to as the Allan Robb Campus, or ARC, facility.
 Our Market Opportunity 
 The global transfusion diagnostics market is large and well established. Total annual product sales in this market amounted to $3.4 billion in 2018, of which the United States accounted for $0.9 billion of sales. Product sales comprise the sale of kits and reagents and instruments. In 2018, we believe blood grouping accounted for $1.4 billion of product sales, disease screening using serological methods accounted for $0.9 billion of sales and disease screening using molecular methods accounted for $1.1 billion of sales. We believe product sales in 2018 to the highly concentrated donor testing market, which includes diagnostic laboratories, accounted for approximately $2.3 billion of sales, while patient testing and others accounted for the remaining $1.1 billion of sales. Performed primarily within hospitals, the patient testing market is highly fragmented. 
 According to the World Health Organization, 45 million blood donations were collected globally in 2018 within “high-income” countries located in North America, Europe and Eastern Asia. In the United States, between 11 and 12 million units of whole blood and red blood cells were donated during 2018, based on data from the American Association of Blood Banks and the American Red Cross. In addition, over 50 million plasma donations are collected each year in the United States and Europe. Plasma is subject to blood grouping and disease screening. We estimate that over 90 million patients are blood grouped annually in the developed world, although less than half of these patients actually receive a blood transfusion. 
 Combined, the cost of procuring and characterizing blood for transfusion represents a significant cost to the global healthcare system. The costs and expenses related to blood grouping and disease screening are typically included in the price a hospital pays for a unit of blood. In the United States, the average price paid by a hospital for a unit of red blood cells is approximately $207, based on the 2017 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey. Where a hospital requests units of blood with a specific antigen profile (for patients with blood group antibodies) the average price of those antigen negative units of blood in the United States is estimated to increase by $80 for each antigen screened. The costs and expenses related to patient blood grouping at hospitals are not specifically reimbursed by a third party payor, but are typically absorbed within the reimbursement structure of a broader medical procedure. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2020 laboratory fee schedule, the reimbursement rate for outpatient services associated with basic antigen typing and an antibody screen is $50 per sample. When an antibody screen is positive, an antibody identification procedure will be undertaken on the patient sample for which the reimbursement rate is an additional $283 per sample. 
 Blood grouping and disease screening techniques have remained generally unchanged for many years. Varying levels of automation are offered by existing instrument platforms, although more complex blood grouping procedures such as extended antigen typing and antibody identification are more typically undertaken manually, especially in the United States. The need for ongoing routine manual testing continues to impose a significant cost burden on the healthcare system. 
 Beyond transfusion diagnostics we plan to pursue the development of immunoassay and molecular testing opportunities for the MosaiQ platform technology within the broader clinical diagnostics market place, forecasted to reach $40 billion annually by 2023.  
 The industry and market data, forecasts and estimates used in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report had been published before or do not otherwise take into account the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore do not reflect any impact of COVID-19 on any specific market or globally.

Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is based on the development and commercialization of a flexible and unique microarray technology and manufacturing capability for serological and molecular testing across a broad array of medical and life science applications.  Our initial strategic focus is on the development and commercialization of a range of consumables (or microarrays) to address the global transfusion diagnostics market.  Each microarray will incorporate existing, well characterized assays to undertake:

(i) | a comprehensive characterization of donor and patient blood, including extended antigen typing and antibody detection/identification. Ultimately, we expect there to be two blood grouping microarrays, one for the donor testing market and one for the patient testing market. We refer to the blood grouping microarrays as the MosaiQ IH Microarray; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | all mandated serological disease screening tests for donor red blood cells or source plasma. We refer to the serological disease screening microarrays as the MosaiQ SDS Microarray. The initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray will comprise assays to detect CMV (cytomegalovirus) and Syphilis. We expect to follow our initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray launch with the launch of a range of additional expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarrays incorporating all remaining mandated serological disease screening assays, depending upon the final application for the product; and 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | all mandated molecular disease screening tests for donor red cells or source plasma. We refer to the molecular disease screening microarray as the MosaiQ MDS Microarray. 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In May 2020, we completed development of the MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray, which we developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray is designed as a serological disease screening microarray specific to COVID-19 antibody detection. The assay detects the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.
 We are also developing for Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc. (or Ortho), a dedicated MosaiQ IH Microarray optimized for the patient transfusion market (which we refer to as the MosaiQ IH3 Microarray), and we expect to submit it for CE mark in the first half of calendar year 2022.
 Together, we refer to the MosaiQ IH Microarray, MosaiQ SDS Microarray, MosaiQ MDS Microarray, MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray and MosaiQ IH3 Microarray as MosaiQ Microarrays.
 We manufacture the MosaiQ Microarrays at our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Eysins, Switzerland, which received its ISO 13485: 2016 certification in December 2018.
 Quotient completed the CE marking self-certification for the MosaiQ Instrument in 2018 in relation with the submission for CE mark of the initial MosaiQ IH Microarray.
 Our launch sequence is: (i) an expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray comprising an expanded antigen typing panel for the donor testing market; (ii) a second expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray comprising the extended antigen typing panel and an expanded antibody detection panel for the patient testing market; and (iii) an expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarray, the menu for which will vary according to local regulatory requirements. 
 In Europe, the MosaiQ Instrument, the initial MosaiQ IH Microarray and the initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray have received, and the expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray, the expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarray, the MosaiQ MDS Microarray, and the corresponding MosaiQ instrument upgrades, will be subject to, CE Marking. In the United States, we submitted 510(k) filings in respect of the initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray, comprising tests for CMV and Syphilis, and the MosaiQ Instrument in December 2019. On December 10, 2020, we received a request from the FDA for additional testing data related to specific individual performance characteristics of the assays on this microarray. We anticipate that we will resubmit our filing and receive 510(k) clearance for the initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray during calendar year 2021 The MosaiQ Instrument is classified as a Class II medical device by the FDA. The FDA has also indicated to us that the MosaiQ IH Microarray and the expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarray will be subject to biologics license applications, or BLAs.
 In April 2019, we received CE Mark approval for the initial MosaiQ IH Microarray, and in February 2020, we received CE Mark approval for the initial MosaiQ SDS Microarray. We commenced field trials for the expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray in Europe in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. These trials were initially suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, but by the end of May 2020, quarantine and containment measures and restrictions had eased in all three trial locations allowing the work to recommence. However, subsequent governmental restrictions implemented towards the end of 2020 have impacted our ability to conduct these trials, as discussed below. We announced the initial results from these trials in November 2020. Based on our internal performance testing, we subsequently determined to enhance a limited number of the tests on the expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray. We now expect to make the initial European regulatory submissions for our expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray during the third quarter of calendar year 2021. The commencement of field trials in the United States for the expanded MosaiQ IH Microarray has also been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect these trials to commence in the second half of calendar year 2021, with the U.S.

regulatory submissions following in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 or first quarter of calendar year 2022. We expect field trials for the expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarray to commence towards the end of calendar year 2021 and we expect to make a European regulatory submission for the expanded MosaiQ SDS Microarray in the second quarter of calendar year 2022, with the U.S. regulatory submission following in the second or third quarter of calendar year 2022. In addition, we are developing the MosaiQ IH3 Microarray for Ortho, and we expect to submit it for CE mark in the first half of calendar year 2022.
 Furthermore, on April 27, 2020, we published the final performance data for the MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray, achieving 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity, and on May 1, 2020, we announced the CE Mark for this Microarray. In addition, in May 2020, we submitted an application to the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray in the United States, and in September 2020, we announced the EUA had been issued by the FDA for this Microarray. We signed the first commercial contract for the sale of the MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray in May 2020, and we have subsequently entered into nine additional contracts with customers in Europe and the United States.  In addition, we developed an enhanced, semi-quantitative MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray, which has been CE marked as of January 29, 2021.
 In our conventional reagent business, we have FDA approvals to sell 82 reagent products in the United States and have 75 products with a CE Mark.  Through this business, we intend to continue to strengthen the Quotient brand, expand our customer base, reinforce our relationship with the FDA and other key regulators and continue to service our key OEM and direct customers. 
 Blood Grouping 
 Prior to blood transfusion, or when there is likelihood that a blood transfusion might be required, extensive blood grouping procedures are undertaken on patient and donor blood using in vitro diagnostic products. These procedures ascertain the blood group of the patient and ensure the compatibility of donor blood. The testing regime is designed to prevent transfusion reactions, which can range from mild to fatal. 
 Red blood cells (the cellular portion) and plasma (the fluid portion) are the principal components of blood. On the exterior of red blood cells are blood group antigens that determine an individual’s blood group (A, B, AB, O), or ABO group, and type (RhD positive or RhD negative), or Rh type. In addition, there are other clinically significant blood group antigens that may be present on patient and donor red blood cells. Plasma contains many different kinds of proteins, including: (i) blood group antibodies, such as Anti-A and Anti-B; (ii) unexpected blood group antibodies developed by the body in response to foreign red blood cell antigens introduced during transfusion (alloantibodies); or (iii) blood group antibodies developed following pregnancy. Blood group antibodies mirror the antigen families that are present on red blood cells. In its normal state, blood does not contain antibodies that will react with its own red blood cell antigens (autoantibodies). 
 Because of the potential for a transfusion reaction, it is crucial that clinicians correctly identify the blood group antigens and antibodies present in donor and patient blood prior to transfusion. If a donor’s red blood cells contain antigens that are recognized by and react with existing blood group antibodies in the patient’s plasma, the transfused red blood cells could be destroyed in a potentially life-threatening reaction. The identification of blood group antigens on donor and patient red blood cells is typically referred to as blood typing or basic antigen typing, with a more comprehensive characterization being referred to as extended antigen typing. The identification of blood group antibodies in plasma is typically referred to as antibody identification. 
 All patients potentially requiring a blood transfusion will generally be blood grouped, including pregnant women, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, patients undergoing surgery or patients suffering from chronic diseases that require regular blood transfusions, such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease. 
 Patient blood will typically be subject to a basic antigen typing and an antibody screen. Less than 1% of patients that have not received a blood transfusion will screen positive for an antibody. The incidence of blood group antibodies, however, increases significantly to 3 to 8% in patients who have previously received a blood transfusion and women that have given birth to two or more children. When an antibody screen proves positive, a complex and time-consuming procedure will be performed by skilled technicians to identify all clinically significant blood group antibodies in the patient’s plasma. This largely manual process may take two to six hours to complete, although more complex cases can take one or more days to complete. Antibody identification represents a significant cost to hospitals, particularly those that treat large numbers of chronically transfused patients. Reagents used for antibody identification also have a short shelf life, typically being shipped on a 28-day cycle, making management of blood grouping reagent inventories more complex with increased waste.

The increasing incidence of alloantibodies developing in patients who have received multiple transfusions, commonly referred to as alloimmunization, has prompted clinicians to request costly, extended antigen matching of donor blood for at-risk patient groups, such as those suffering from thalassemia or sickle cell disease. The incidence of antibodies present in these patient groups is estimated to be 20 to 30%. These patients typically also present with multiple antibodies, making the process of antibody identification more complex and time consuming and the procurement of antigen specific units of donor blood much more expensive. 
 According to a study published in January 2014, the estimated total cost of extended antigen typing for patients is $364, based on a screen for 14 antigens at an estimated cost of $26 per antigen. 
 Donor blood will typically be subject to a basic antigen typing and an antibody screen. Clinicians will request specific antigen negative donor blood for patients with one or more blood group antibodies. In this instance, multiple donor units will be selected from inventory by the donor collection agency and subjected to an extended antigen typing procedure to identify the most appropriate units for the patient. This procedure is completed to ensure that the corresponding antigen to the patient’s antibody is not present on the donor’s red blood cells. 
 The number of donor units that need to be screened to identify specific antigen negative units varies depending upon blood group. In the Caucasian population, for example, ten donor units on average would need to be screened to find two units of donor blood negative for the Duffy-A antigen. Similarly, to identify two units of donor blood negative for the little-e antigen, one hundred donations would need to be screened and, to identify two units of blood negative for the little-k antigen one thousand donations would need to be screened. Additionally, the number of units needed to be screened increases significantly if the patient has two or more antibodies. 
 The identification of antigen negative units of blood is largely a manual and labor-intensive process. Because of the additional testing procedures required and the large numbers of donor units that must be screened, antigen negative donor units are more expensive for hospitals to purchase. The average premium charged for antigen negative units of blood in the United States is estimated to be $80 for each antigen screened. 
 We believe both donor collection agencies and hospitals would prefer to fully characterize donor units and patient blood through extended antigen typing prior to transfusion, although the time and expense required to undertake such procedures is currently prohibitive. As a consequence, extended antigen typing is only undertaken as needed (i.e., where the patient has a specific antibody) on a small percentage of donor units. Extended antigen typing for patients is also typically undertaken only in patients expected to be chronically transfused. 
 Disease Screening 
 The safety of donor red blood cells and source plasma is ultimately the responsibility of donor collection agencies, with regulatory agencies in individual countries establishing safeguards and standards to ensure patient safety. In the developed world, donor red blood cells and source plasma is subject to mandatory screening for infectious diseases before it can be released for transfusion or further manufacture. Two different methods of testing have been adopted—a serological approach (testing for specific antigens or antibodies) and, for certain viruses, a molecular approach (testing for DNA or RNA). The United States, many countries in Western Europe and Japan require both serological and molecular disease screening be performed on donor blood. In the United States, it is mandatory to screen donor blood using serological techniques for the following: Syphilis, HBV Surface Antigen, HBV Core Antibody, HCV Antibody, HIV Type 1 and Type 2 Antibodies and HTLV Antibodies. Most blood collection agencies will also screen for CMV, using the same serological approach and the FDA recommends donor blood to be screened for Chagas disease. Molecular disease screening is required to be performed on donated blood to screen for HBV, HCV, HIV, West Nile virus, Babesia and Zika. Other pathogens, such as Dengue and Malaria are transmissible by blood, but there is no test currently available, given cost or technology limitations. 
 Serological and molecular disease screening is already largely automated. However, it is typically undertaken using instrument platforms that are not integrated with commonly used blood grouping instruments.

Donor Testing 
 In the developed world, the testing of donated blood is primarily completed by donor collection agencies. In the United States, following the merger of the testing laboratory operations of the American Red Cross with Creative Testing Solutions, effective on January 1, 2018, one organization tests approximately 75% of the U.S. blood supply. Throughout Western Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada, national collection agencies, or a small number of regional collection agencies, typically collect and test all donated blood. Currently, donor testing laboratories must adopt multiple instrument platforms, as well as undertake complex manual testing procedures for extended antigen typing or antibody identification, to complete the required testing for donated blood. Maintaining multiple instrument platforms requires complex quality control and assurance procedures, along with costly service and support infrastructures. 
 Single instrument platforms for each testing procedure have typically been adopted within and across laboratory networks. In addition, donor testing laboratories typically utilize costly manual testing techniques to identify antigen negative donor units and to carry out any antibody identification procedures required. 
 Patient Testing 
 Patients are typically blood grouped in hospitals. Large-to-medium-sized hospitals will generally adopt one of several semi-automated instrument platforms to perform basic blood grouping procedures. These instruments employ either column agglutination technology supplied by companies such as Ortho, Bio-Rad and Grifols, or solid-phase microplate technologies supplied by companies such as Immucor. These platforms offer only a limited number of blood grouping tests per testing run and are therefore cumbersome, especially if a more comprehensive characterization of the patient’s blood is required. Consequently, laboratories that have adopted a blood grouping instrument platform will continue to use manual or semi-manual techniques to undertake more complex procedures, such as antibody identification or extended antigen typing. 
 Because of the continued need for manual testing, many small-to-medium-sized hospitals choose not to adopt existing instrument platforms. Instead, they will use manual or semi-manual techniques for basic blood grouping. Complex procedures, such as antibody identification, may also be outsourced to independent testing laboratories by these hospitals. We believe the continued requirement for manual testing and drawbacks of existing instrument platforms for blood grouping have limited the attraction of offering blood grouping services to hospitals by large independent testing laboratories, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. 
 The MosaiQ Solution for Transfusion Diagnostics
 We have initially developed MosaiQ to address the comprehensive needs of the global transfusion diagnostics market. We believe MosaiQ has the potential to transform transfusion diagnostics by substantially reducing costs and offering a range of operational efficiencies within donor and patient testing laboratories, while improving patient outcomes through the more complete characterization of donor and patient blood. 
 Specifically, we have initially developed MosaiQ to: 
  
• | Comprehensively characterize donor and patient blood; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Screen donor blood for specific viruses using serological and molecular methods.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to pursue a “razor/razor blade” business model for MosaiQ, placing MosaiQ Instruments and securing long-term agreements for the supply of MosaiQ IH Microarrays and/or MosaiQ SDS Microarrays and MosaiQ MDS Microarrays used by those instruments. We expect donor and patient laboratories to adopt MosaiQ because it is designed to offer a comprehensive characterization of clinically significant blood group antigens and antibodies, while also offering the opportunity for substantial cost savings and a range of operational efficiencies. We believe these customers would prefer to more fully characterize the blood of all donors and patients to facilitate better blood matching. While MosaiQ is designed to be a highly cost-effective solution for our customers, delivering substantial cost savings, we also expect to generate attractive, long-term profit margins on the sale of MosaiQ Microarrays. 
 We have designed MosaiQ leveraging our expertise in transfusion diagnostics. MosaiQ combines novel manufacturing techniques and well-characterized blood grouping and disease screening tests to create multiplex testing microarrays for use on a high-throughput instrument, the MosaiQ Instrument. Through miniaturization, we plan to combine a full portfolio of existing serological tests on two distinct microarrays for use on MosaiQ – one for blood grouping or immunohematology (or IH) and one for serological disease screening (or SDS). We are also developing a third microarray for molecular disease screening (or MDS).  We expect there to be multiple variants of each microarray depending upon the stage of development and the end markets in which we expect the MosaiQ Microarrays will be adopted. 
 - 10 -

In a donor testing environment, the MosaiQ IH Microarray and the MosaiQ SDS Microarray have been designed to run simultaneously, utilizing the same donor sample and the same MosaiQ Instrument. The MosaiQ MDS Microarray would also be utilized in a donor testing environment. In a patient testing environment, only MosaiQ IH Microarrays would be utilized.
 Our novel approach incorporates existing, well-characterized tests for blood group antigens and antibodies on a single consumable for the global market. Each MosaiQ IH Microarray consists of two panels – one for antigen typing (comprising printed monoclonal antibodies) and one for antibody detection/identification (comprising printed human red blood cells). We believe MosaiQ, when launched, will be the only commercially available automation platform capable of offering this breadth of testing on a single consumable. 
 The MosaiQ SDS Microarray has been designed to incorporate all tests required to meet current regulatory requirements for serological disease screening of donor blood and source plasma in the markets in which we intend to operate. Initially we will include tests to screen serologically for Syphilis and CMV, and subsequently in the expanded MosaiQ SDS microarray, we plan to include additional tests for HBV, HCV, HIV, HTLV and Chagas disease. The MosaiQ SDS Microarray has additional capacity to incorporate further serological disease screening tests should it be necessary in the future. 
 The MosaiQ MDS Microarray is being designed to incorporate all mandated tests required to meet current regulatory requirements for molecular disease screening for donor blood and source plasma in the markets in which we intend to operate. We plan to include molecular tests to screen for HBV, HCV, HIV, West Nile virus, HEV and Zika. 
 MosaiQ Microarrays are manufactured using a novel, patented printing technology we have further developed with TTP plc, or TTP, a leading European technology development company. This print technology enables us to industrialize the manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays. We have an exclusive license for the use of this technology in our fields of use and we are not aware of any alternative technology suitable and commercially available for this purpose.
 We have developed a high-throughput, floor standing MosaiQ Instrument for use by both donor collection agencies and medium to large-sized hospitals. The MosaiQ Instrument has been designed to process up to 3,000 microarrays per day (assuming three eight-hour shifts), giving a capacity to test up to 1,500 donor samples (utilizing a MosaiQ IH Microarray and a MosaiQ SDS Microarray) or 3,000 patient samples (utilizing MosaiQ IH Microarrays only). The MosaiQ Instrument can complete the comprehensive characterization of donor or patient blood in less than 35 minutes and has the capability to prioritize urgent patient sample testing, commonly referred to as STAT testing. 
 The MosaiQ Instrument is designed to fully automate blood grouping and perform a simultaneous serological disease screen in a donor testing laboratory. Consistent with the typical workflow of donor or patient testing laboratories, centrifuged tubes of whole blood will be placed on the MosaiQ Instrument for processing. The instrument will then complete a comprehensive blood group characterization of each sample, combined with a parallel serological disease screen in a donor testing environment, with the results being reported through existing laboratory information management systems (or LIMS). 
 We have partnered with STRATEC, a leading global developer of diagnostics instruments, to design, develop and manufacture the MosaiQ Instrument. STRATEC has been operating for over 30 years and has significant experience designing, developing and manufacturing in vitro diagnostics instruments, including a number of existing instruments used today for blood grouping and disease screening. 
 We are also collaborating with key potential donor and patient testing customers on the development of MosaiQ. This group includes the American Red Cross and Creative Testing Solutions, along with several other major hospitals, donor collection organizations and reference laboratories. 
 COVID-19 Antibody Detection 
 At the end of December 2019, Chinese public health authorities reported several cases of acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. Chinese scientists soon identified a novel coronavirus as the main causative agent. The disease is now referred to as novel coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, and the causative virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The virus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide.

SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through droplets and contact routes, and the virus infects human cells via binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2.  Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough and fever. However, symptoms can be more severe for some people and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. The elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. Based on previous studies on SARS, an incubation period from three to 14 days after onset of symptoms may be expected.
 Specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may be detectable in COVID-19 patients during the symptomatic phase of the disease after RNA is no longer detectable. The persistence of IgG antibodies allows identification of people who have been infected in the past, and likely have recovered from the illness. It is not yet fully known if IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confer immunity to re-infection. We believe IgG detection and other serological assays will play an important role in the research and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, including post-vaccination, and we have developed and commercialized our MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray to address these needs.
 Our Conventional Reagent Business 
 We have over 35 years of experience in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of conventional reagent products for blood grouping. Our conventional reagent products, which are branded as Alba by Quotient, are used primarily to identify blood group antigens and antibodies in donor and patient blood and to perform daily quality assurance testing for third-party blood grouping instrument platforms. We also undertake product development projects for our OEM customers, generating product development fees. Following development, we enter into long-term supply contracts with our OEM customers to manufacture and supply the products we have developed. 
 We currently develop, manufacture and commercialize the following key products: 
  
• | Antisera Products —These products contain antibodies used to identify blood group antigens. The majority of our antisera products are monoclonal antibodies manufactured from master cell lines we own;

We have developed several conventional reagent products launched by Ortho over the past five years. As a result, Ortho accounted for 60% and 6% of our product sales in the years ended March 31, 201 and 2020, respectively. We have recently developed a range of rare antisera products for use on Ortho’s instrument platforms. These products have now received CE Marking for sale in Europe and have been approved for sale in the United States by the FDA.  We also sell a range of whole blood control products, red blood cell products and ancillary products to Ortho worldwide, many of which have been launched over the past five years. 
 MosaiQ Manufacturing and Supply 
 We have leased a facility in Eysins, Switzerland (near Geneva), which is the initial manufacturing site for MosaiQ Microarrays.
 TTP plc (“TTP”)
 We have entered into an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license with TTP to certain patented technologies and trade secrets to enable high volume manufacturing of MosaiQ Microarrays. The license is for uses that include antigen typing, antibody detection and serological disease screening of donated blood for infectious diseases (collectively, the initial purpose), as well as all human blood sample diagnostic testing on batch processing instruments (collectively, the additional purposes), with the exception of companion diagnostics, epigenetics and nucleic acid sequencing. Pursuant to this license agreement, we are paying TTP a $10 million license fee (the TTP License Fee), which is payable in installments through September 30, 2021. We have paid $5.5 million under this agreement to date, with the balance due in September 2021, but with an option to defer $3.0 million to September 2022. Should we elect to defer the payment of the $3 million, the total payable under the license agreement will increase by $0.5 million. The additional $0.5 million will also be payable in September 2022. If the TTP License Fee payments are not made by us when due, we will lose the license to the additional purposes, but not to the initial purpose. We will pay a low single digit royalty to TTP based on our net sales for 20 years or for so long as the licensed intellectual property is protected by patent in the country of sale. We began paying this royalty during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 in connection with the commercialization of the MosaiQ COVID-19 Microarray.
 TTP has also granted us a non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use certain other intellectual property TTP owns and has incorporated into bespoke components of the manufacturing system for MosaiQ Microarrays. The agreement will remain in effect so long as the licensed intellectual property is subject to patent or other intellectual property protection. TTP may terminate the agreement if we assist another party in disputing the validity and/or scope of any of TTP’s patented intellectual property covered by the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement with immediate effect by notice to the other party upon the occurrence of bankruptcy events. Any fee disputes are subject to mandatory dispute resolution. 
 STRATEC SE (formerly STRATEC Biomedical AG) (“STRATEC”)
 We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with STRATEC pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed minimum number of MosaiQ Instruments during the six years following completion of the development contract. We estimate our aggregate remaining obligation under this agreement to total $68.8 million using exchange rates on March 31, 2021. The agreement is terminable by either party for certain breaches by the other party or in the event of certain bankruptcy events involving the other party. If STRATEC terminates the manufacturing agreement, certain termination payments are payable by us depending upon the number of the instruments purchased at the time of termination, and we are also responsible for certain costs. 
 We also entered into a development agreement with STRATEC pursuant to which it developed the MosaiQ Instrument. Pursuant to the development agreement, STRATEC has granted us an irrevocable, fully-paid, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to intellectual property that is developed for use by, or the manufacture of, the MosaiQ Instrument, as well as an exclusive right to market and sell the MosaiQ Instrument. STRATEC has additionally granted us, or agreed to grant, similar rights to its pre-existing technologies for use in development and manufacturing activities for the MosaiQ Instrument. We may only exercise our rights to manufacture in limited circumstances when STRATEC fails to perform under the manufacturing agreement and such rights are subject to a to be negotiated license fee. 
 Quality 
 Our quality function (composed of quality assurance, quality control and validation) oversees the quality of our manufacturing as well as the quality systems used in research and development and sales and marketing. We have established a control system that oversees implementation and maintenance, document control, supplier qualification, corrective and preventative actions, as well as employee training processes that we believe ensures quality across our operations. We continuously monitor and seek to improve quality over time and believe the implementation of these processes has supported product performance, customer satisfaction, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We market our conventional reagent products directly in the United States. Outside of this territory, we sell our products to a range of third-party distributors and OEM customers. In the United States, we use a combination of sales managers, sales representatives, customer service staff and technical experts to interact with laboratory managers and administrative staff, purchasing directors, medical directors and other individuals and groups involved in the implementation of blood testing programs. We market our MosaiQ products directly in both Europe and the United States through a similar combination of field based sales representatives and technical experts, supported by client services staff.  
 Our goal is to educate our customers about the technical and economic benefits of switching from competing offerings to our products. Our customer service staff and technical experts are also involved in the practical training of customers, as well as answering customer questions. These teams are supported by various marketing activities, which include advertising, medical education, attendance at scientific meetings and other awareness-raising activities. As of March 31, 2021, we had 40 employees engaged worldwide in sales, marketing and customer service functions. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on the further development of MosaiQ and new conventional reagent products. We believe we have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific talent needed to develop new products that leverage our significant blood grouping expertise. We believe our experience in developing tests based on existing serological testing methods will allow us to conceive, develop and validate comprehensive multiplex tests utilizing MosaiQ. 
 As of March 31, 2021, we had 182 employees engaged in research and development functions. 
 Customer Funding and Reimbursement 
 In the United States, our transfusion products are not directly subject to reimbursement by governmental or commercial third-party payors for health care services. The costs and expenses related to donor blood grouping and disease screening are typically included in the price to a hospital of a unit of blood. The costs and expenses related to patient blood grouping at hospitals are not specifically reimbursed by a third-party payor, but absorbed within the reimbursement structure of a broader medical procedure. We supply products to our customers, including hospitals, donor testing laboratories, independent testing laboratories and OEM customers based on negotiated prices. 
Competition 
 In the past 15 to 20 years, the transfusion diagnostics market has experienced considerable consolidation, particularly in the United States. Given significant barriers to entry, there are only a small number of vendors currently addressing this market. These vendors can be divided into four groups: (i) those offering instrument platforms for blood grouping and related microarrays, in addition to conventional reagent products for manual testing; (ii) those only offering conventional reagent products for manual blood grouping; (iii) those offering raw materials for inclusion in products used on instrument platforms for blood grouping and in conventional reagent products; and (iv) those offering instruments for disease screening and related microarrays. A small number of donor collection agencies continue to manufacture a limited range of products, primarily for internal use. 
 In our view, barriers to entry for the transfusion diagnostics market include: 
  
• | the need to manufacture a broad range of complex antisera products, with annual volume requirements ranging from hundreds of milliliters to hundreds of liters, depending upon individual blood group specificities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to reliably procure and formulate red blood cell donations with the appropriate antigen profiles to support the manufacture of red blood cells for antibody identification and whole blood control products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rigorous global regulatory requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | customers who can be reluctant to change product suppliers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Our principal competitors in the United States are Immucor, Ortho and Grifols. The principal market participants in Europe are Bio-Rad, Ortho, Grifols and Immucor and the principal market participants in Japan are Ortho and Immucor. 
 For serological disease screening, only two vendors have instruments approved for sale in the United States – Abbott and Ortho. Outside the United States, Abbott, Ortho, Roche and Bio-Rad are the principal instrument providers for serological disease screening.
 For molecular disease screening, only two vendors have instruments approved for sale in the United States – Grifols and Roche. Outside the United States, Grifols and Roche are the principal instrument providers for molecular disease screening. 
 - 14 -

For COVID-19 antibody detection, our principal competitors are Roche, Abbott, Ortho, Siemens, Bio-Rad and Euroimmun.
 For products sold to OEM customers, the cost of switching vendors (raw material and/or finished costs) can be considerable, given regulatory scrutiny of the manufacturing process and the potential need to modify instrument platforms and software. For our OEM business, we consider Merck/Millipore and Diagast to be our primary competitors. We are also a customer of each of these two organizations. We believe the complexity and high cost of switching suppliers, together with our ownership of key products and associated regulatory licenses, reduce the risk of loss of our important OEM business. We believe the FDA-licensed status of our manufacturing facility also offers major benefits as our key OEM customers seek to either establish or defend their position in the United States market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on various exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements, granting rights to patent-protected technologies relating to the manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays and instruments. We have entered into an exclusive license with TTP to patented technologies to enable high volume manufacture of MosaiQ Microarrays. In addition, STRATEC has agreed to grant us licenses to certain of its pre-existing technologies and has granted us licenses to technologies developed under our development agreement with it, for use in the sale of MosaiQ instruments, and in the development and manufacture of the MosaiQ instrument, which it will undertake on our behalf. See “Business— MosaiQ Manufacturing and Supply—TTP plc” and “—STRATEC SE” for additional information about these agreements. These licenses are material to the development and commercialization of MosaiQ. The remaining lives of the patents for key existing technologies that we have licensed currently exceed 10 years. 
 We have an issued U.S. patent related to blood typing that expires in September 2027. This patent provides methods of detecting the presence of red blood cells coated (or sensitized) with host antibody and/or components of the complement system. We received counterpart patents for this U.S. patent in Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan, which also expire in September 2027.
 
In February 2015, we filed two patent applications which are now the subject of issued US patents. The first provides a new method for detecting red blood cells thereby providing a basis of positive controls to confirm the addition of red blood cells to a microarray, and the second, which is also the subject of issued patents in a number of countries, provides for crossmatching blood samples, finding particular application in immunological assays, where it can be used to assess compatibility of donor and patient blood. In November 2015, we filed a patent application providing for a purification method which can be applied to sourcing antibodies from human material, the result of which can be used in the manufacture of the MosaiQ Microarrays.
 In January 2018, we filed a provisional U.S. patent application relating to methods and kits for detecting nucleic acids, antigens and antibodies in a sample using a microarray platform, in addition to a method for the amplification of nucleic acids. We made a further filing in December 2018 designating the European Patent Office as the International Searching Authority for this patent application.
 During the year ended March 31, 2021 we filed five new patent applications related to assay, manufacturing processes and software related inventions.
 We also rely upon copyright protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We have developed several conventional reagent products launched by Ortho over the past five years. We generally retain ownership of the intellectual property for these products and their associated regulatory licenses.

Government Regulation 
 In the United States, medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of medical products. Prior to marketing certain medical products, manufacturers are required to obtain permission from the FDA via a product approval or clearance. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to file submissions, refusal to approve or clear products, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, field actions, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, refusal to permit the importation of product, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 The FDA regulates in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, products intended to evaluate blood as either biological products or medical devices. In general, reagents used to identify blood types, including extended antigen typing, and detect and identify antibodies in plasma, as well as assays intended for disease screening of the blood supply are regulated as biological products, while the instruments that conduct the analyses and quality assurance products intended to test the accuracy of instrument platforms are regulated as medical devices. 
 The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are not part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that generally mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices, including IVDs. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive, including the IVD Directive (Directive 98/79/ EC), will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA. On May 26, 2017, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR 2017/746), or IVDR, which replaces the IVD Directive. Our products in the European Union will have to comply with the IVDR requirements after May 26, 2022. Until that time, our products must continue to meet the requirements of IVD Directive for commercialization in the European Union.
 Outside of the United States and the European Union, regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of IVD medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. The process in these countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter and/or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new IVD medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become more lengthy and costly over time. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials, which, among other matters, subjects us to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those relating to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of biological and hazardous materials and wastes. The primary hazardous materials we handle or use include human blood samples and solvents. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party liable for contamination at currently and formerly owned, leased and operated sites and at third-party sites without regard to fault or negligence. 
 We monitor our facilities carbon emissions, use of water, electricity and gas, as well as waste production and disposal, including maximizing opportunities to recycle waste streams.
