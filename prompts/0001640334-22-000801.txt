ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
History

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 14, 1987, under the name Shur De Cor, Inc. and engaged in developing certain mining claims. In April 1999, Shur De Cor merged with Interactive Marketing Technology, a New Jersey corporation that was engaged in the business of developing and direct marketing of consumer products. As the surviving company, Shur De Cor changed its name to Interactive Marketing Technology, Inc. Shur De Cor's then management resigned and the management of Interactive New Jersey became the Company’s management. The prior management of Shur De Cor retained Shur De Cor’s business and assets. After that acquisition, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, IMT's Plumber, Inc., produced, marketed, and sold a licensed product called the Plumber's Secret, which was discontinued in fiscal 2001. In May 2002, the Company ceased to actively pursue its product development and marketing business and actively sought to either acquire a third party, merge with a third party or pursue a joint venture with a third party in order to re-enter its former business of development and direct marketing of proprietary consumer products in the United States and worldwide.

On November 17, 2004, the Company acquired MPL, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement executed by the parties (the “2004 Agreement”). In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 109,623,006 shares of its common stock to Imperial International Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Imperial”), the sole shareholder of MPL, in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPL capital stock (the "2004 Share Exchange"). Upon completion of the share exchange, MPL became the Company's wholly owned subsidiary and the Company’s former owner transferred control of the Company to Imperial. The Company relied on Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in regard to the shares that we issued pursuant to the 2004 Share Exchange. The Company treated this transaction as a qualified "business combination" as defined by Rule 501(d). The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D promulgated under, the Act in issuing the Company’s securities.

In connection with the 2004 Share Exchange, the Company: (i) changed its name from Interactive Marketing Technology, Inc. to China Artists Agency, Inc.; (ii) obtained a new stock symbol, "CAAY", and CUSIP Number, effective on December 21, 2004; (iii) increased its authorized common stock to 200,000,000 shares; (iv) effectuated a 1 for 1.69 reverse stock split; and (v) spun off the Company’s existing business into a separate public company, All Star Marketing, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("All Star"). All Star was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Spin-off was satisfied by means of a pro-rata share dividend to the Company's shareholders of record as of December 10, 2004. The purpose of the Spin-Off was to allow the subsidiary to operate as a separate public company and raise working capital through the sale of its own equity. This allowed the Company’s management to focus on its business, while at the same time, allowing the spun-off company to have greater exposure by trading as an independent public company. Additionally, the shareholders and the market would then more easily identify the results and performance of the Company as a separate entity from that of All Star. In August 2005, the Company changed its name to China Entertainment Group, Inc. and effective August 9, 2005, obtained a new stock symbol "CGRP", and CUSIP Number.

Effective July 22, 2010, the Company merged with Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, the management of the Company resigned and was replaced by the management and principals of Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC. The holders of interests in Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC exchanged their interests for approximately 50.2% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company. In September 2010, the Company effectuated a 9.85 for one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2010. After the Merger, the Company became a television network and multimedia information and distribution company focused on serving the homeland security and emergency preparedness industry. 

On February 15, 2016, the Company sold to Asia Cosmos Group Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of British Virgin Islands (“ACOSG”), 10,000,000 shares of its common stock at a per share price of $0.027. ACOSG’s sole shareholder is Miky Wan. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to ACOSG. In connection with the private placement to ACOSG, a change of control occurred and Bryan Glass resigned from his position as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Chairman of the Company. 

Miky Wan was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, President and Director, effective February 19, 2016. 

Effective February 26, 2016, the Company changed its name to Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and filed a Certificate of Amendment to such effect with the Nevada Secretary of State. The name change and the related stock symbol change to “COSG” were approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on March 31, 2016. The Company also increased the number of its authorized common stock, par value $0.001, from 90,000,0000 shares to 500,000,000 and its preferred stock, par value $0.001, from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares.

On January 13, 2017, the Company sold 200,000,000 shares of its common stock to ACOSG at a per share price of $0.001 per share for aggregate consideration of US $200,000. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to ACOSG.

Acquisition of Lee Tat, Our Logistics Business

On May 12, 2017, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lee Tat from Mr. Koon Wing Cheung, Lee Tat’s sole shareholder, in exchange for 219,222,938 shares of its issued and outstanding common stock. In connection with the Lee Tat acquisition, Miky Wan resigned from her positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Koon Wing Cheung and Yongwei Hu were appointed to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, and also as directors of the Company. The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of Lee Tat.

Such securities represented approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding securities of HKHL.

The common stock being sold constitutes sixty-six and seventy-seven hundredth percent (66.77%) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.

Other Activities

We hope to exploit our DOT technology and the metaverse to bring innovation to the sports space, bridge the intersection of our DOT technology and Sports memorabilia to improve experiences for fans, athletes, teams, events and partners.

Our Business

We are a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our subsidiaries based in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in two business segments: (i) the physical arts and collectibles business, and (ii) the financing/money lending business. 

Through our physical arts and collectibles business, we provide authentication, valuation and certification (“AVC”) service, sale and purchase, hire purchase, financing, custody, security and exhibition (“CSE”) services to art and collectibles buyers through traditional methods as well as through leveraging blockchain technology through the creation of Digital Ownership Tokens (“DOTs”). We initially intend to focus on customers located in Hong Kong and expand throughout Asia and the rest of the world.

We conduct our DOT operations from Singapore. In Singapore, cryptocurrencies and the custodianship of such cryptocurrencies are not specifically regulated. Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, but not considered legal tender. To the extent that cryptocurrencies or tokens are considered “capital market products” such as securities, spot foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and the like, they will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), Securities and Futures Act, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. To the extent that tokens are deemed “digital payment tokens,” they will be subject to the Payment Services Act of 2019 which, among other things, require compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. According to the Payment Services Act of 2019, “digital payment token” means any digital representation of value (other than an excluded digital representation of value) that (a) is expressed as a unit; (b) is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; (c) is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; (d) can be transferred, stored or traded electronically; and (e) satisfies such other characteristics as the Authority may prescribe. Our DOTs, therefore, are not securities or digital payment tokens subject to these acts. 

We receive fiat and cryptocurrency from the sale of art and collectibles and collection of transaction fees derived from the secondary and subsequent sales of the collectibles. In order to minimize the risk of price fluctuation in cryptocurrency, after we receive the cryptocurrencies we will recognize the value by immediately exchange them into US dollar or stable currencies that are pegged with US dollar. 

We conduct our financing/money lending business through our Hong Kong subsidiaries which are licensed under Hong Kong’s Money Lenders Ordinance. We primarily provide unsecured personal loan financings to private individuals. We also have a small portfolio of mortgage loans. Revenue is generated from interest received from the provision of loans to private individual customers.

There may be prominent risks associated with our operations being in Hong Kong. We may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government including the risk that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could change the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.

As a U.S.-listed company with operations in Hong Kong, we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the soon to be effective Data Security Law, may target the Company’s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Our Operations in Hong Kong” as herein.

Our corporate organization chart is below.   

Note 1: In May 2021, Massive Treasure entered into a Share Swap Letter Agreement (the “100% Share Swap Letter”) with the shareholders of each of E-on Finance Limited (“E-on”) and 8M Limited ("8M") to acquire 100% of each of E-on and 8M for 20,110,604 and 10,055,302 shares of common stock of COSG respectively based upon the closing price of the common stock of COSG as of the date of signing of the 100% Share Swap Letter and determined in accordance with the terms of the 100% Share Swap Letter on the date. The acquisition of E-on and 8M consummated in May 2021. Thereon, COSG issued 10,256,409 shares and 5,128,204 shares to the shareholders of E-on and 8M respectively. 

COSG is obligated to issue 9,854,195 and 4,927,098 shares on the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition to the former shareholders of E-on and 8M respectively, subject to certain clawback provisions. E-on and 8M are obligated to meet certain financial milestones in each of the two year anniversaries following the closing. Failure to meet such milestones will result in a clawback of the shares issued to the former shareholders. On the second anniversary of the closing, if E-on or 8M exceeds the aggregate financial milestone set for the two years, the former shareholders thereof shall be entitled to additional shares of COSG as determined in accordance with the 100% Share Swap Letter.

Note 2: In May and June 2021, Massive Treasure entered into a Share Swap Letter Agreement (the “51% Share Swap Letter”) with the shareholders of each of the entities to acquire 51%  of the issued and outstanding securities of the entities for an aggregate amount of 23,589,736 shares of COSG’s common stock as set forth below (the “First Tranche Shares”), based upon the closing price of the common stock of COSG as of the date of signing the 51% Share Swap Letter and determined in accordance with the terms of the 51% Share Swap Letter. The acquisition of the entities consummated in May and June 2021.  Thereon, COSG issued the First Tranche Shares. 

On the first anniversary of the closing, COSG is obligated to issue a second tranche of shares of its common stock, based upon the closing price of its shares as of the fifth business day prior to such first anniversary as determined in accordance with the terms of the 51% Share Swap Letter (the “Second Tranche Shares”).  Upon the issuance of the Second Tranche Shares, each of the entities will deliver the remaining 49% of the issued and outstanding securities to COSG to become wholly owned subsidiaries of COSG. Each of the entities are obligated to meet certain financial milestones in each of the two year anniversaries following the closing. Failure to meet such milestones will result in a clawback of the shares issued to the former shareholders. On the second anniversary of the closing, if any entity exceeds the aggregate financial milestone set for the two years, the former shareholders thereof shall be entitled to additional shares of COSG as determined in accordance with the 51% Share Swap Letter. 

We are a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and Singapore. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiaries and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and its Hong Kong subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), or Cybersecurity Administration Committee (“CAC”), to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we (the parent company and our subsidiaries) may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions would likely change the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”

We reported a net loss of $25,149,399 and net income of $467,725 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had current assets of $23,981,701 and current liabilities of $22,748,075 as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our current assets and current liabilities were $14,721,331 and $15,271,366, respectively. The financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders.

On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with Williamsburg Venture Holdings, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Investor”), pursuant to which the Investor agreed to invest up to Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) over a 36-month period in accordance with the terms and conditions of that Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Commitment”).

Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of these. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, if necessary, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.

We are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries. 

Market Overview

According to The Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report 2021, the global arts market annual transactional volume is estimated to be $50.1 billion for 2020. According to Forbes, the global collectibles market reached $370 billion in 2016. Reuters reported that the collectible NFT market is approximately $13.7 million in the first half of 2020. Our DOT builds on top of the blockchain NFT technologies as the underlying technology infrastructure, even though we are still in the early stages in adoption of our DOTs, the trading volume of NFTs as reported by Reuters for the first half of 2021 has already reached approximately at $2.5 billion. Building on top of the blockchain NFT technologies, we believe DOTs have the potential to be as revolutionary and widely adopted as the internet. The unique properties of DOTs position them as a digital alternative to representing ownership of art and collectible pieces. We expect the DOT ecosystem to expand into the mainstream of art community around the world in the coming decades. 
Our Products and Services

A few of the challenges with collecting physical arts and collectibles are provenance of the piece, authenticity and valuation. The vision of Coinllectibles is to modernize the way we buy, collect and trade art and collectible pieces to provide a more pleasurable, transparent, and value enhancing experience for the collector and artist communities.

Coinllectibles intends to leverage blockchain technology to help resolve the issues of provenance, authenticity and ownership in the arts and collectibles market. We intend to embed into the blockchain for each art or collectible piece an independently apprised valuation, a 3D rendering of the piece, high-definition photo of the piece, AI recognition file of the piece and a set of legal documents to provide proof of ownership and provenance of the piece to the blockchain. Each piece will be minted into an individual DOT with the list of items embedded. The DOTs are intended to provide assurance on the authenticity of art or collectible pieces as well as act as a record of ownership transfers using blockchain technology to establish provenance of the piece. We believe this type of DOT would address some of the key challenges collectors presently face with arts and collectibles.

We currently provide several services, including authentication, valuation and certification (“AVC”) service, sale and purchase, hire purchase, financing services, and custody, security and exhibition (“CSE”) services.

AVC Services

As part of our AVC services, we conduct authentication appraisal and valuation assessment of arts and collectibles through a panel of independent third-party appraisers. The appraisers will appraise the items and produce a certification showing whether the collectible piece is authentic with their estimated value. Once the item has been authenticated, it will undergo a scanning process to build a 3D model and a unique “fingerprint ID” for the item will be created through proprietary AI technology for future verification.

For Coinllectibles to be able to digitize the art and collectible pieces using blockchain technology, we first purchase the pieces from its current owner. We then charge the owner a fee for digitizing the pieces. Once the pieces are minted into DOTs, we work with our partner channels to distribute and sell the DOTs.


6

Hire Purchase Services; Financing 

We facilitate the purchase of arts and collectibles by offering certain of our buyers the option of taking possession of the arts and collectibles while paying on an installment basis. Prior to receipt of full payment, ownership of the arts and collectibles will remain with Coinllectibles. Once the buyer makes the last payment, the ownership of the arts and collectibles will transfer to the buyer once full payment has been received. 

CSE Services

For collectors who have been purchasing our arts and collectibles and do not wish to take collection of the pieces, we intend to offer custodian services and have these arts and collectibles stored and safely secured until the collector elects to take possession. We also intend to allow the collectors to subscribe for additional security services for their art pieces be it when it is in our custody or when the item is on the move either to be delivered or collected from the collector. We will also introduce exhibition services to collectors and artist to organize exhibitions of artworks and collections in our gallery or other specialized art events.

Our Distribution Channels 

We have or expect to distribute and sell our DOTs through the following channels:


· | Traditional sales channels: Institutions and wealthy individuals who may be prospective art and collectibles purchasers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Auction houses such as Spink & Sons, that have an existing pool of prospective collectors. We will explore opportunities to collaborate with reputable auction houses, such as Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Macey & Son. 
· | Our metaverse platform (MetaMall) – coinllectibles.art allows collectors to efficiently buy and sell Fusion DOTs using fiat and cryptocurrency. We recognize that there are distinct groups of crypto natives and non-crypto natives who share the same interest in acquiring collectibles. To make their experience more seamless and user-friendly, we work with various crypto exchanges to accept their currencies as payment for the Fusion DOTs collectibles. In addition, we have also set up a payment gateway which accepts credit / debit card payments for the same purpose.
· | NFT-supported marketplaces such as OpenSea, SuperRare and Rarible that have been educating the public about digital art and collectibles, we will seek the best options to place our pieces in these marketplaces. We believe we can collaborate with these platforms to educate their collectors on physical arts and collectibles. This not only helps artist to expand their audience pool, it also helps these collectors to expand their collection range. 
· | Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, OKEx, Huobi and FTX as they have a ready pool of users that we can immediately engage to educate and share about physical arts and collectibles. In year 2021, we started to work with OKEx, and we further expand to Binance in the first quarter of 2022. 


We use a wide range of social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram and held Ask Me Anything sessions through social media channels to reach out to the general community to announce our art exhibitions, the DOTs attached to the pieces and news about our partnerships with artists. Coinllectibles will also participate in arts and collectibles events and exhibitions to promote us as a firm and the DOTs that we will be launching.

Pricing determination 

Pricing of our products and services is based on our operating costs, volume of product / service, fees charged by strategic partners and suppliers, market condition and competition. We also participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with our joint venture partners in which we have pre-set mechanism. Based on the above factors and conditions, we may evaluate and adjust our pricing from time to time.

In light of the competitive nature over the market and industry, we believe that our success will depend upon the reliability and quality of products & services provided and cost management. In general, we strive to maintain top class of high-quality products and services as well as to meet customers’ satisfaction. We are dedicated to establishing systems and operating procedures to achieve service standardization and quality control over the products and services provided by Coinllectibles. We expect to continuously monitor and seek to improve on a series of key service quality indicators (“KPI”) to maintain a competitive advantage in the market and industry.

Our Business Plan

On October 22, 2021, Massive Treasure, a subsidiary of Cosmos Group Holdings Inc., acquired 51% of NFT Limited (“NFT”) through the issuance of 2,350,229 shares of common stock of the Company. NFT beneficially owns Talk+, a messaging and cryptocurrency-focused mobile application which seeks to simplify the crypto usage experience by allowing users to send crypto through instant messages to other individuals. We hope that the inclusion of Talk+ will enable us to attract more non-crypto native users and broaden our community reach. 

In late December 2021, we launched our metaverse platform (“MetaMall”), which we believe is an important step to further engage with our growing community of collectors and partners.  Our MetaMall will feature pieces from an increasing range of artists and sportsmen. We hope to bring more limited-edition collectibles to more people through MetaMall.  We believe that our DOTs will bridge the virtual and physical world in art and collectible ownership and enjoyment. Our DOT is a virtual token that represents the ownership of an asset and is the foundation of Coinllectibles™️ metaverse that Coinllectibles™️ defines as a multiverse where the real world interacts seamlessly with the emerging virtual dimensions.

In late January 2022, we partnered with Spink & Sons, an art auction house, on its inaugural DOT offering, where we created a hybrid- DOT to a physical collectible piece.  We intend to pursue additional similar partnership opportunities in the future.

On February 10, 2022, we consummated the acquisition of 80% of the issued and outstanding securities of Grand Gallery Limited, a Hong Kong limited liability company engaged in the business of selling traditional art and collectible pieces, through the issuance of 153,060 shares of our common stock, at a valuation of $4.00 per share. We believe that this acquisition will strengthen our DOT business by expanding our access to buyers of arts and collectibles.  

In March 2022, we launch a new sports division in our MetaMall and partnering with a former NBA basketball player as president of Coinllectibles Sports. We hope to exploit our DOT technology and the metaverse to bring innovation to the sports space, bridge the intersection of our DOT technology and sports memorabilia to improve experiences for fans, athletes, teams, events and partners.

Insurance

We maintain certain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices in Hong Kong. Under Hong Kong law, it is a requirement that all employers in the city must purchase Employee's Compensation Insurance to cover their liability in the event that their staff suffers an injury or illness during the normal course of their work. We maintain Employee’s Compensation Insurance, vehicle insurance and third-party risks insurance for the business purposes.
CORPORATE INFORMATION

Our principal executive and registered offices are located at 37th Floor, Singapore Land Tower, 50 Raffles Place, Singapore 048623, telephone number +65 6829 7017.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS

We expect to rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “Digital Ownership Token” and Coinllectibles brands and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

The laws of Singapore, Hong Kong and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.

We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending on the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. In certain countries, intellectual property protection may be more limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection for our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.


8


We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.

We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

COMPETITION

We operate in a highly specialized area that is evolving very quickly with rapid developments. Currently there is no direct competitors in the market as we operate in a niche and specialized area of the market. However, we foresee that our eventual competitors would be leading arts and collectible sellers such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s which may offer substantially the same or similar service offerings as us. Auction houses have a well-established customer base and brand name, but they have not developed sophisticated technology to transform their business into the blockchain NFT technology area. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

· | breadth of artist and collectibles base;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | sophistication of proprietary technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | excellence in legal expertise; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | strength and recognition of our brand.
--+---------------------------------------


Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, we anticipate that larger, more established companies may directly compete with us as we continue to demonstrate the viability of our DOT solution. Many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger customer base or to monetize that customer base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on such terms.

EMPLOYEES

We are currently operating with 3 executive directors and 20 consultants.

We have the following fulltime employees located in Hong Kong as set forth below:


Executive officers | 0

We are required to contribute to the Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) for all eligible employees in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participant’s income based on their ages and wage level. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the MPF contributions by us were $29,760 and $35,973, respectively. We have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS

Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. is a Nevada corporation with operating businesses located in Singapore and Hong Kong. As such, the parent holding company, Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. is subject to the laws and regulations of the United States of America while our operating businesses are subject to the laws and regulations of Singapore and Hong Kong, as applicable, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property laws. Furthermore, we need to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong and Singapore governing the data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers or clients. As the information of our potential customers or clients are preserved in both Hong Kong and Singapore, we need to comply with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.

If PRC authorities reinterpret PRC laws to apply to Hong Kong companies, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations that might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into RMB, acquire any other PRC companies, establish variable interest entities in the PRC, or make dividend payments from any future wholly foreign owned entities to us.

United States of America 

Regulation of Cryptocurrency and Government Oversight

As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of digital assets networks, digital assets users and the digital assets exchange markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service-providers that hold digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital assets transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital assets activity. 

Various foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Bitcoin network, the digital assets markets, and their users, particularly digital assets exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions' regulatory scope. For example, on May 21, 2021, minutes of the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council of the People's Republic of China were published, at which, as part of an effort to prevent and control financial risks, restrictions on digital assets mining and trading activity were discussed. On May 18, 2021, certain influential trade bodies, including the China Banking Association, the Payment and Clearing Association of China, and the National internet Finance Association of China, issued a statement instructing their members not to provide virtual currency-related trading or payments services, or the exchange of virtual currencies for China's renminbi, among others, to their customers. In 2017, the People's Bank of China and other Chinese financial regulators issued an announcement prohibiting token issuances such as initial coin offerings, and imposing restrictions on virtual currency exchange platforms and financial institutions and non-bank payment institutions in connection with token-related activity. There have been reports over the years that Chinese regulators have taken action to shut down a number of China-based virtual currency exchanges. On March 5, 2020, South Korea voted to amend its Financial Information Act to require virtual asset service providers to register and comply with its AML and counter-terrorism funding framework. These measures also provide the South Korean government with the authority to close virtual currency exchanges that do not comply with specified processes. The South Korean government previously banned initial coin offerings. Similarly, in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned the entities it regulates from providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or settling digital assets. On March 5, 2020, this ban was overturned in the Indian Supreme Court, although the Reserve Bank of India has challenged this ruling. The laws, regulations or directives of authorities in jurisdictions worldwide may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of or demand for digital assets by users, merchants and service providers, may impede the growth or continued operation of the global digital assets economy or digital assets mining, or may otherwise negatively affect the value of digital assets. 

While we believe that our DOT’s is currently not a security or commodity subject to many of the U.S. laws and regulations governing securities and commodities, the legal environment is constantly changing as new laws and regulations are introduced and adopted, and existing laws and regulations are repealed, amended, modified and reinterpreted. The effect of any future regulatory change on Cosmos Group Holdings Inc., our operating subsidiaries or our digital assets such as our DOTs is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adversely impact current product offerings or alter the economic performance of our existing products and services resulting in a decline in the value of our securities.

Privacy and Protection of User Data

We and subsidiaries are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in the countries where we operate. Our business will involve the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. 
Singapore

Regulations on Cryptocurrency

We intend to conduct our DOT operations from Singapore. In Singapore, cryptocurrencies and the custodianship of such cryptocurrencies are not specifically regulated. Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, but not considered legal tender. To the extent that cryptocurrencies or tokens are considered “capital market products” such as securities, spot foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and the likes, they will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), Securities and Futures Act, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. To the extent that tokens are deemed “digital payment tokens,” they will be subject to the Payment Services Act of 2019 which, among other things, require compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. According to the Payment Services Act of 2019, “digital payment token” means any digital representation of value (other than an excluded digital representation of value) that

(a) | is expressed as a unit; 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; 
(c) | is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt;
(d) | can be transferred, stored or traded electronically; and 
(e) | satisfies such other characteristics as the Authority may prescribe; 


We believe our DOT’s are not securities or digital payment tokens subject to these acts.

Employment Ordinance

Hong Kong

The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.

An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are HKD$7,100 and HKD$30,000 respectively.

China

Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to COSG.

PRC Regulations on Tax

Enterprise Income Tax

The EIT Law was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.

                The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.

                In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.

                Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.


12


                In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.

                On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.

Value-added Tax

                Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, or the VAT Regulations, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the People’s Republic of China are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling services of transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction and lease of immovable, selling immovable, transferring land use rights, selling and importing other specified goods including fertilizers; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.

                According to the Notice on the Adjustment to the Value-added Tax Rates issued by the SAT and the MOF on April 4, 2018, where taxpayers make VAT taxable sales or import goods, the applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 17% to 16% and from 11% to 10%, respectively. Subsequently, the Notice on Policies for Deepening Reform of Value-added Tax was issued by the SAT, the MOF and the General Administration of Customs on March 30, 2019 and took effective on April 1, 2019, which further adjusted the applicable tax rate for taxpayers making VAT taxable sales or importing goods. The applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 9%, respectively.

Dividend Withholding Tax

The EIT Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

PRC Laws and Regulations on Employment and Social Welfare

Labor Law of the PRC

                Pursuant to the Labor Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on July 5, 1994 with an effective date of January 1, 1995 and was last amended on August 27, 2009 and the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, became effective on January 1, 2008 and was last amended on December 28, 2012, with the amendments coming into effect on July 1, 2013, enterprises and institutions shall ensure the safety and hygiene of a workplace, strictly comply with applicable rules and standards on workplace safety and hygiene in China, and educate employees on such rules and standards. Furthermore, employers and employees shall enter into written employment contracts to establish their employment relationships. Employers are required to inform their employees about their job responsibilities, working conditions, occupational hazards, remuneration and other matters with which the employees may be concerned. Employers shall pay remuneration to employees on time and in full accordance with the commitments set forth in their employment contracts and with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Our Hong Kong subsidiary currently does not comply with PRC laws and regulations, but complies with Hong Kong laws and regulations.

Social Insurance and Housing Fund

                Pursuant to the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on October 28, 2010 and became effective on July 1, 2011, employers in the PRC shall provide their employees with welfare schemes covering basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and occupational injury insurance. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees in full for all the employees in compliance with the relevant regulations. We may be ordered by the social security premium collection agency to make or supplement contributions within a stipulated period, and shall be subject to a late payment fine computed from the due date at the rate of 0.05% per day; where payment is not made within the stipulated period, the relevant administrative authorities shall impose a fine ranging from one to three times the amount of the amount in arrears. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees as required by relevant regulations.

In accordance with the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund, which were promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999 and last amended on March 24, 2002, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. Employers and employees are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time. Our subsidiaries have not registered at the designated administrative centers nor opened bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. They also have not deposited employees’ housing funds. Our subsidiaries may be ordered by the housing provident fund management center to complete the registration formalities, open bank accounts, make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit if they become subject to PRC laws. Failing to register or open bank accounts at the expiration of the time limit could result in fines of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000. And an application may be made to a people’s court for compulsory enforcement if payment and deposit has not been made after the expiration of the time limit.

PRC Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 

General Administration of Foreign Exchange

The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, RMB is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13

                Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.

                If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.

                Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.

                We cannot assure that our PRC beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.

Circular 19 and Circular 16

                Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.

                Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:


· | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.

                Our PRC subsidiaries' distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.

PRC Share Option Rules

Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.

PRC Regulation of Dividend Distributions

The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
