ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Mobile Mini, Inc. - General
 We believe we are the world’s leading provider of portable storage solutions, and are committed to providing our customers with superior service and access to a high-quality and diverse fleet.  We are also a leading provider of specialty containment solutions in the United States (“U.S.”).  Our mission is to uphold our leadership positions in portable storage solutions to customers throughout North America and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and become the provider of choice for specialty containment products in the U.S.
Business Model
 Mobile Mini, founded in 1983, focuses on renting rather than selling our units, with rental revenues representing approximately 95% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We believe this strategy provides us with predictable, recurring revenue.  Additionally, our assets have long useful lives, low maintenance and generally maintain their value throughout their useful lives.  We also sell new and used units and provide delivery, installation and other ancillary products and value-added services.
 Our business is comprised primarily of two product categories:
  
- | Storage Solutions
--+------------------

 This category consists of our container and ground level office product offerings. We offer a wide range of Storage Solutions products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as patented locking systems, premium doors, electrical wiring and shelving. Our Storage Solutions products provide secure, accessible storage for a diversified client base of approximately 74,000 customers across various industries, including construction, retail and consumer services, industrial, commercial and governmental. Our customers use these products for a wide variety of storage applications, including construction materials and equipment, retail and manufacturing inventory, maintenance supplies, documents and records, household goods, and as portable offices.
  
- | Tank & Pump Solutions
--+----------------------

 Our Tank & Pump Solutions products consist primarily of liquid and solid containment units, pumps and filtration equipment. Additionally, we provide an offering to our customers of value-added services designed to enhance the efficiency of managing liquid and solid waste. The client base for our Tank & Pump Solutions products includes customers in specialty industries, such as chemical, refinery, oil and natural gas drilling, mining and environmental.
 As of December 31, 2019, our network includes 120 Storage Solutions locations, 20 Tank & Pump Solutions locations and 16 combined locations.  Included in our Storage Solutions network are 15 locations in the U.K., where we are a leading provider, and two in Canada. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 200,200 units, and our Tank & Pump business has a fleet of approximately 12,700 units.  In the discussions below, we generally refer to our business and assets as either “Storage Solutions” or “Tank & Pump Solutions.”
 Recent Strategic Transactions
 In March 2019, we created more capital flexibility and positioned Mobile Mini for future growth by entering into the Second Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement dated as of March 22, 2019 (the “Credit Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (“Deutsche Bank”), as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which replaced our prior Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement dated as of December 14, 2015. The Credit Agreement extends the maturity of our ABL financing to March 2024 and reduces fees associated with unused credit.
Industry Overview
 Storage Solutions
 The storage industry includes two principal sectors, fixed self-storage and portable storage. The fixed self-storage sector consists of permanent structures located away from customer locations to store excess household goods. We do not participate in the fixed self-storage sector.
 The portable storage sector, upon which our business focuses, differs from the fixed self-storage sector, as it brings the storage solution to the customer’s location and fulfills the need for secure storage with immediate access to the storage unit. 
 4

The advantages of portable storage include convenience, immediate accessibility, and lower price. In contrast to the fixed self-storage sector, the portable storage sector is primarily used by businesses. This sector of the storage industry is highly fragmented and remains primarily local in nature. Although there are no published estimates of the size of the portable storage market, we believe the sector is expanding due to the increasing awareness of the advantages of portable storage and that portable storage units are achieving increased market share compared to other portable options because containers provide ground level access, better protection against wind or water damage, higher security and improved aesthetics when compared to certain other portable storage alternatives such as van trailers.
 We also offer ground level offices to serve the modular space industry, which includes mobile offices and other modular structures. Our ground level offices are either custom designed and manufactured or made from converted ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers.  In addition, our fleet includes combination steel ground level office/storage units in varying lengths and widths to serve the various requirements of our customers.
 Tank & Pump Solutions
 In the specialty containment sector, we service different markets. We serve the industrial market, which is comprised mainly of chemical facilities and refineries (the “downstream” market), and, to a lesser extent, companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas (the “upstream” market).  Additionally, we serve a diversified group of customers engaged in projects in the construction, pipeline and mining markets.  Downstream customers utilize our equipment and services to manage and remove liquid and solid waste generated by ongoing operating activities as well as turn-around projects and large-scale expansion projects, while upstream customers tend to rent steel tanks to store water used in well hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”).  Other customers utilize a wide variety of our products differentiated by the type of project in which they are engaged.
Business Environment and Outlook
 Based on our assessment, we expect that the majority of our North American end markets will continue to drive demand for our products, although some macro-economic indicators are pointing to slower growth.  The construction industry, which represents approximately 36% of our consolidated rental revenue, is forecasted to continue to show growth.  Economic indicators related to the industrial and commercial end-segment are mixed.  Industrial and commercial customers, which comprise approximately 26% of our rental revenue, generally operate in industries such as:  large processing plants for organic and inorganic chemicals, refineries, distributors and trucking and utility companies.  Our national retail accounts typically involve seasonal demand in the third and fourth quarter during the holiday season.  Retail and consumer service customers comprise approximately 23% of our rental revenue and include department, drug, grocery and strip mall stores as well as hotels, restaurants, service stations and dry cleaners.  Upstream oil and gas customers comprise approximately 2% of our rental revenue and include companies performing such activities as exploratory well drilling, operation of producing wells and bringing crude oil and/or raw natural gas to the surface using alternative methods. 
 In October 2019, the U.K. and E.U. agreed upon the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. in the form of a Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by the U.K. Parliament, and the European Parliament in Brussels, in late January, with the consequence that Brexit formally occurred on January 31, 2020.
 Economists predict there may be a modest improvement in the U.K. economy in the early months of 2020, as certain of the uncertainties facing the economy are diluted by the decisive U.K. election result and the certainty of the U.K. leaving the E.U. on January 31, 2020. This may lead to business investment decisions and commitments to major projects going ahead. However, the upside is expected to be limited by, among other things, longer-term Brexit uncertainties after the end of 2020. The current opinion of most economists is that, even after the U.K. formally leaves the E.U., there will be no lasting recovery until a U.K.-E.U. trade deal is in place.
 Competitive Strengths
 Our competitive strengths include the following: 
 Market Leader. We believe we are the world’s largest provider of portable storage solutions, the largest portable storage provider in North America, a market leader in portable storage and accommodation solutions in the U.K., where we have nearly 100% geographic coverage, and the third largest provider of specialty containment solutions in the U.S.
 5

Our business units operate under one family of brands.  The portable storage business is branded as “Mobile Mini Storage Solutions,” while our specialty containment business is known as “Mobile Mini Tank + Pump Solutions”.  Together we are “Mobile Mini Solutions”.  The Mobile Mini Solutions brand name is associated with high quality products, superior customer service and value-added solutions. Our branding reinforces this reputation and communicates to Mobile Mini’s customers that the Company offers a diversified portfolio of products, with consistent quality and world-class service.
 We believe we are one of a few competitors in the U.S. and the U.K. who possess the brand awareness, network of locations, customer relationships and infrastructure to compete on a national and regional basis while maintaining a strong local market presence.
 Superior, Differentiated Products and Service.  Within Storage Solutions, we offer a wide breadth of products and proprietary security features, like our patented tri-cam locking system. This product differentiation within the Storage Solutions sector and our superior service allows us to gain market share and charge premium rental rates.
 We also offer a broad range of Tank & Pump Solutions equipment and value-added services, which enables us to meet customers’ ongoing needs throughout the various life cycles of projects unique to the petrochemical and industrial industries.  Our comprehensive turnkey solutions to customers’ containment, storage, pumping and filtration needs drive the creation of strong long-term partnerships with our customers.
 Sales and Marketing Emphasis. We target a diverse customer base and, unlike most of our competitors, have developed sophisticated sales and marketing programs enabling us to expand market awareness of our products and generate strong organic growth. We have a dedicated, commissioned sales team that works within our highly customized customer relationship management (“CRM”) system. We manage our salespersons’ effectiveness through extensive sales call monitoring, mentoring and intensive training programs. Our digital advertising includes paid and organic search, industry targeted content, social messaging and strategic partnerships.  Additionally, our web site is designed to maximize organic and local search features, making use of location-specific content using the latest in technology to connect our customers with the nearest branch, as quickly as possible. Our web site features video case studies, product specifications, easy access to our customer portal and supports real time sales inquiries that enable customers to chat live with salespeople.
 National Presence with Local Service.  We have invested significant capital developing a national network of locations that serve most major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and the U.K. Our national presence in both markets allows us to offer our products to larger customers who wish to centralize the procurement of Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump Solutions products on a multi-regional or national basis.  We have leveraged and will continue to leverage our national Storage Solutions presence and infrastructure across the U.S. to facilitate the geographic expansion of our Tank & Pump Solutions division.  Locally, our branch managers, sales representatives and drivers develop and maintain critical long-lasting relationships with our customers who benefit from our reach and exceptional service, as well as our wide selection of products.
 Customer Service. The portable storage industry is service intensive. To position ourselves to understand our customers’ needs, we have trained our sales force to focus on all aspects of customer service from the sales call onward. We use Salesforce.com® as our CRM platform to increase our responsiveness to customer inquiries and to efficiently monitor our sales force’s performance. 
 We use a Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) system to measure customer loyalty through real time surveys conducted by a third party. We utilize customer feedback to drive service improvements across the Company, from our field locations to our corporate headquarters, resulting in proven success as evidenced by our best in class NPS score of 86% for 2019. We differentiate ourselves by coupling market-leading product quality, security, convenience, selection and availability, with exceptional customer service. We believe our superior customer service drives customer satisfaction and we survey our customers to determine the ease of doing business with us.  Survey results are scrutinized to prioritize customer-facing process improvements. 
 Within the tank and pump industry, we have leveraged our broad range of products and expertise to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our Tank & Pump Solutions business offers a full suite of the liquid and solid containment equipment required to execute a comprehensive containment solution that often must meet stringent regulatory and technical requirements.  
 Management Information Systems and Proprietary Digital Solutions.  We continue to make significant investments in the management information systems supporting our operations. Our customized management information systems enable us to optimize fleet utilization, control pricing, dispatch and track our trucks, capture detailed customer data, evaluate and approve credit applications, monitor company results, gain efficiencies in 
 6

internal control compliance, and support our growth by projecting near-term capital needs. These systems also provide insight into estimating our forward-looking market potential by territory, enabling us to be more proactive and responsive when driving specific revenue streams.  Decision makers and field personnel at all levels have access to real-time business information. In addition, we consistently capture relevant customer demographic and usage information to target new customers within existing and new markets. These capabilities result in a competitive advantage over smaller, less sophisticated regional competitors.
 As part of our commitment to be the supplier of choice for our customers in 2019 we expanded several proprietary digital business solutions. Our customer portal MM ConnectTM provides our customers real-time access to track and execute customer rental agreements, request services, review account history and make payments. In 2018 and 2019, we also introduced several mobile applications to drive efficiencies when interacting with our customers including delivery notifications, enabling real time contract activations and confirmation of delivery with digital signatures.  In 2019, we launched a live chat feature on our website that allows customers to be guided through the entire rental process digitally by a sales team member.  This alignment of technology and process provides value for our customers, drives market share growth and enables Mobile Mini to be easy to do business with.
 Within the tank and pump industry specifically, we offer EnviroTrackTM, a proprietary, sophisticated technology platform that provides detailed real-time data capture, tracking and customized reporting capabilities.  We continue to further develop EnviroTrackTM as a GPS and smart-device enabled solution allowing our Tank & Pump Solutions customers to manage both their equipment on rent as well as their waste streams through the life cycle of the rental period.  Our technology is a market differentiator, enabling us to develop strong, long-term relationships with the majority of our customer base, many of whom are large, blue-chip companies.
 In addition to our customer-facing solutions, we continue to deploy new technology internally to promote efficient and effective processes within operations.  In 2019, we implemented a new mobile platform to facilitate the inspection and repair process of units returning from rental contracts. This process ensures we have accurate status of all assets in yards and provides a clear view of specific required maintenance by unit, which ultimately results in accurate and timely billing of any damage caused while on rent. All solutions deployed are designed to ensure our fleet is maintained in a rent ready state.  
 Safety. At Mobile Mini, we are committed to the safety of our employees and our business partners.  We believe that our focus on safety is a competitive advantage, as customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions, especially in the Tank & Pump Solutions segment.
Business Strategy
 Our strategic goal is to accelerate rental revenue growth and expand our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency.  To achieve this goal, we intend to continue execution of the following strategies:
 Focus on Core Rental Business with Higher Returning Assets. Our rental business provides predictable recurring revenue and high margins.  We are constantly evaluating our portfolio of product offerings to ensure our capital is invested in products that provide optimal returns. 
 Generate Strong Organic Growth. We focus on increasing market penetration and gaining additional revenues from existing customers as well as gaining new customers through sophisticated sales and marketing programs aimed at increasing brand recognition, expanding market awareness of the uses of portable storage and differentiating our superior products from those of our competitors. In particular, we have experienced increased customer demand for our ground level offices and anticipate strong rental revenue growth related to this product group.
 Opportunistic Geographic Expansion. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of varying sizes for our North America Storage Solutions business.  Acquisitions are a method we may use to create value, gain market share and expand to new or underserved markets in North America where we believe demand for portable storage units is underdeveloped.  We also have a proven strategy to enter markets by migrating available fleet to new markets that can be serviced by nearby full-service field locations. From these start-up operational yards, we are able to redeploy existing available fleet, allowing for cost effective new location openings with minimal capital expenditures. We also believe we have the opportunity to geographically expand the markets in which we offer Tank & Pump Solutions products.
 7

Innovative Product Offering. Our wide offering of products with varying features expands the applications and overall market for our Storage Solutions products. Within our Tank & Pump Solutions products, we offer one of the broadest ranges of services and containment equipment in the industry complemented by an assortment of pumps and filtration units designed to allow us to partner with customers through every project stage.  We believe that there will continue to be substantial demand for our rental products throughout North America and the U.K.  
 Managed Services.  For certain of our customers, we partner with other rental companies to provide supplementary product and service offerings that may not be provided as part of our core product offering. Arranging these comprehensive services for our customers increases customer loyalty while generating additional rental revenue without additional investment in fleet. 
 Opportunities for Cross-selling and Expansion. By leveraging Mobile Mini’s national footprint we can expand the geographic reach of our Tank & Pump Solutions products. Additionally, our significant Tank & Pump Solutions presence in downstream markets, particularly in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., has allowed us to leverage established, long-term Tank & Pump Solutions relationships for their Storage Solutions needs.
 Focus on Efficient Utilization of Fleet. We are focused on following disciplined pricing practices and maintaining the right mix of products within each geography to maximize the return on our assets and we continuously strive to enhance our fleet management processes to maximize fleet availability. Additionally, our salesforce proactively reaches out to the market to increase awareness of our products and has sophisticated tools to increase sales productivity. Optimizing fleet availability enables increased utilization resulting in higher rental margins, reduced capital expenditure requirements and maximum return on investment.
 Drive Profitability of Existing Locations.  We have established key performance indicators to optimize profitability at individual locations and incentivize local management teams based on the performance of their branch.  We also compare results across locations and regions to identify areas of opportunity for growth or for increased efficiencies.
 Continuous Improvement in Our Systems.  We have made significant investments in our management information systems supporting our operations and believe these systems give us a competitive advantage. We utilize SAP® Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system which is a scalable platform to support future growth. We are focused on continued enhancements that drive further process improvements and efficiencies.
Products
 To achieve favorable pricing and optimize our capital expenditures we centrally manage the purchasing of our rental fleet.  We acquire our products through a trusted worldwide network of industry leading suppliers and manufacturers, negotiating competitive purchasing programs aimed at reducing total cost of ownership and maximizing asset returns across all of our business units.  We maintain our assets at industry leading quality standards through rigorous maintenance programs executed throughout its branch network.  We do not generally maintain long-term contracts with any of our suppliers.
 We protect our products and brands through the use of trademarks and patents. In particular, we have patented our proprietary tri-cam locking system, our Container Guard Lock and other continued improvements in our locking technology both in the markets in which we operate, as well as in Europe and China.

Product Lives and Durability
 We rent containers and equipment that have been in our fleet for various lengths of time at similar rates, without regard to the age of the unit. Third-party appraisals on our rental fleet are required by our lenders on a regular basis. The appraisals typically report no difference in the value of the unit due to the age or length of time it has been in our fleet.  These appraisals are used to calculate our available borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Based in part upon our lender’s third-party appraiser who evaluated our fleet as of August 31, 2019, management estimates that the net orderly liquidation appraisal value of our rental fleet at December 31, 2019 was approximately $1.1 billion.  Our net book value for this fleet as of December 31, 2019 was $966.2 million.
Storage Solutions
 Steel containers have a long useful life with no technical obsolescence. Our steel portable storage containers and steel ground level offices have estimated useful lives of 30 years from the date we build or acquire and remanufacture them, with residual values of 55%. We maintain our steel containers on a regular basis by removing rust, painting them with rust inhibiting paint, plug-welding holes, and occasionally replacing the wooden floor or a rusted steel panel. Repainting the outside of storage 
 9

units is the most common maintenance item.  A properly maintained container is essentially in the same condition as when initially remanufactured.
 Tank & Pump Solutions
 When purchased new, our steel tanks and stainless steel tank trailers have estimated useful lives of 25 years, dewatering and roll-off boxes have useful lives ranging from 15 to 20 years and our pumps and filtration equipment have estimated lives of 7 years.  We do not assume any residual value at the end of the assets’ useful lives.  There is a limited secondary market for Tank & Pump Solutions products. We have outlined a stringent quality control and maintenance program to ensure that only equipment of the highest quality is released to the field. Each container undergoes a thorough visual inspection, hydro-testing and ultrasonic thickness testing to identify maintenance requirements.  Tank maintenance includes repainting with rust inhibiting paint, replacing interior liners, and repairing valves, gaskets and rails. This periodic maintenance keeps the Tank & Pump units in essentially the same condition as when initially purchased and is designed to maintain the units’ value.
Depreciation
 We depreciate our rental fleet using the straight-line method over each unit’s estimated useful life after the date we place the unit in service, and the units are depreciated down to their estimated residual values, if any.  Assets obtained through acquisitions are recorded at their then current fair market value and depreciated to their estimated residual value over each asset’s estimated remaining life.
Remanufacturing and Manufacturing of Storage Solutions Containers
 We purchase used ISO containers from leasing companies, shipping lines and brokers. These containers were originally built to ISO standards and are 8 feet wide, up to 9.5 feet high and 20, 40 or 45 feet long. After acquisition, we remanufacture and modify these ISO containers. Remanufacturing typically involves cleaning, removing rust and dents, repairing floors and sidewalls, painting, adding our signs and further customizing units by adding our proprietary easy opening door system and our patented locking system. Modification typically involves splitting some containers into differing lengths.  The capitalized cost for remanufactured units includes the price we paid for the unit, plus the cost of customizing units and freight charges to our location when the unit is first placed in service.  For manufactured units, cost includes our manufacturing cost, customization costs and freight charges to our location when the unit is first placed in service.  In addition, we also purchase containers that have been manufactured in China that meet our size and quality specifications and as a result require no further customization.

Operations
 Our senior management analyzes and manages our business as (i) two Storage Solutions business segments: North America and the U.K. and (ii) one Tank & Pump Solutions business segment. To effectively manage this business across different geographic areas, we divide these business segments into smaller management areas we call divisions, regions and locations. Each of our locations, in their respective segment, generally has similar characteristics covering products rented or sold, similar customer bases, sales personnel, advertising, yard facilities, general and administrative costs and field operations management. Further financial information by segment is provided in Note 16 “Segment Reporting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 We locate our field operations in markets with attractive demographics and strong growth prospects. Within each market, we are located in areas that allow for easy delivery of units to our customers over a wide geographic area. In addition, when cost effective, we seek locations that are visible from high traffic roads in order to advertise our products and our name. A typical branch consists of outdoor storage space for units not currently on rent and a small office.
 Each branch has a manager who has overall supervisory responsibility for all operational activities. Branch managers report to regional managers who each generally oversee multiple locations. Our regional managers, in turn, report to one of our operational senior vice presidents (called a managing director in the U.K.). Performance-based incentive bonuses are a substantial portion of the compensation for these senior vice presidents, regional managers and branch managers.
 Locations have dedicated sales staff and transportation personnel that deliver and pick up units from customers. We also supplement our delivery fleet by outsourcing delivery services to independent haulers when appropriate. The locations have delivery trucks and forklifts to load, transport and unload units and a yard staff responsible for unloading and stacking units. Portable storage steel units can be stored by stacking them to maximize usable ground area. Our branch employees perform preventive maintenance tasks but outsource major repairs and other maintenance requirements either externally or to a senior repair team.
 Sales and Marketing
 Storage Solutions
 We approach the market through a territory-based sales model with local, regional and national sales, including dedicated staff at our field locations as well as at our National Sales Center (“NSC”). Our field sales representatives handle local inbound calls and work to develop their branch territory and deepen local relationships through effective networking. Additionally, throughout the salesforce, we have multiple avenues of customer communication, including digital methods like live chat.  The NSC handles overflow, answering inbound calls and working digital leads while initiating outbound sales campaigns across our footprint. Our one-team approach means that everyone works with our local branch managers and dispatchers to ensure customers receive integrated first-class service from inquiry to pickup.  We believe that offering our customers local sales and service support in addition to the convenience of a centralized sales operation, allows us to serve all of our customers in a dedicated, efficient manner.
 11

Our sales and marketing personnel provide information about our products to prospective customers by handling inbound calls and initiating outbound marketing calls. We have ongoing sales and marketing training programs covering all aspects of sales process and customer service. Our field locations communicate with one another and with corporate headquarters through our ERP system and our CRM platform, Salesforce.com®. This centralization of information enables the sales team to share leads and other information and permits management to monitor and review sales and rental productivity on a location-by-location basis. We improve our sales efforts by recording and rating the sales calls made and received by our trained sales force. Our sales personnel are compensated largely on a commission basis.
 Our national footprint in the U.S. and the U.K. allows us to offer our products to larger customers who wish to centralize the procurement of portable storage on a multi-regional or national basis. Within our portable storage business, we are well equipped to meet these customers’ needs through our National Account Program, which centralizes and simplifies the procurement, rental and billing process for those customers.  Our largest customers tend to participate in our National Account Program. We provide our National Account customers with service guarantees, which assure them they will receive the same superior customer service and access to high quality, diverse fleet from any of our field locations. This program has helped us succeed in leveraging customer relationships developed at one location across our entire network of locations.
 We focus a significant portion of our marketing expenditures on digital initiatives for both existing and potential customers. We also use targeted direct email and digital programs to build brand awareness by communicating market specific features and tying them to industry benefits of using portable storage solutions. We have implemented aspects of search engine marketing like remarketing, pay per click, content curation, and organic search best practices to drive our customers to on-line lead generation integrated into our CRM. Immediately after completion of the online form, our dedicated sales force contacts the customer and completes the request. External market research vendors are an integral part of our sales and marketing approach.
 Tank & Pump Solutions
 Each Tank & Pump Solutions branch is responsible for targeting potential new customers in the branch’s service area and to be available to respond to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The branches are supported by a corporate team, including a sales and marketing department, business development representatives and National Account management.

Our sales personnel are compensated largely on a commission basis.
 Within our Tank & Pump Solutions business we utilize an advanced prospect and customer management software package across our sales force and branch network, providing enhanced visibility and tracking on all prospective customer accounts.  Personnel have access to real-time critical customer information regardless of location.  This access facilitates targeted marketing and sharing of relevant customer information across branches.

Rental Terms
 Storage Solutions
 We enter into contracts with our Storage Solutions customers generally based on a 28-day rate and billing cycle.  The rental continues until cancelled by the customer or the Company. On average, the steel storage containers on rent at December 31, 2019, have been in place for 30 months, and the steel ground level offices on rent at December 31, 2019 have been in place for 15 months. Our rental contracts provide that the customer is responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup and specify that the customer is liable for any damage done to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear. Customers may purchase 
 13

a damage waiver from us to avoid damage liability in certain circumstances, which provides us with an additional source of recurring revenue. Customer possessions stored within a portable storage unit are the responsibility of that customer.
 Tank & Pump Solutions
 Our Tank & Pump Solutions rental contracts typically offer daily, weekly or monthly rates. Certain of our larger customers have multi-year agreements that limit rate increases during the term of the contract.  The rental duration varies widely by application, and the rental continues until the unit is returned in clean condition to us. Rental contracts specify that the customer is responsible for carrying commercial general liability insurance, is liable for any damage to the unit beyond ordinary wear and tear, and for all materials the customer contains in rented equipment. The customer is contractually responsible for the cost of delivery and pickup, as well as thoroughly emptying and cleaning the equipment before return.
Competition
 In all segments, we face competition from local and regional companies, as well as national companies, in substantially all of our current markets. We compete with several large national and international companies in our ground level office product line. Our competitors include lessors of storage units, mobile offices, van trailers and other structures used for portable storage. We also compete with conventional fixed self-storage facilities. In our Storage Solutions segments, we compete primarily in terms of security, convenience, product quality, broad product selection and availability, rental rates and customer service. In our Storage Solutions business, our largest competitors are WillScot Corporation, PODS, Pac-Van, 1‑800-PACK-RAT, Haulaway Storage Containers, ModSpace, McGrath RentCorp, and Wernick Hire, along with other national, regional and local companies. 
 The liquid and solid containment industry is highly fragmented, consisting principally of local providers, with a handful of regional and national providers. In our Tank & Pump Solutions business we compete based on factors including:  quality and breadth of equipment, technical applications expertise, knowledgeable and experienced sales and service personnel, on-time delivery and proactive logistics management, geographic areas serviced, rental rates and customer service. Our competitors include United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Adler Tanks.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we employed 2,042 employees, the majority of which are full time.  Of these employees, 1,643 are employed in North America and 399 are employed in the U.K.  No employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Seasonality
 Demand from our Storage Solutions customers is somewhat seasonal. Construction customers typically reflect higher demand during months with more temperate weather, while demand for our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from September through December because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season. Our retail customers usually return these rented units to us in December and early in the following year. In our Tank & Pump Solutions business, demand from customers is typically higher in the middle of the year from March to October, driven by the timing of customer maintenance projects. The demand for rental of our pumps may also be impacted by weather, specifically when temperatures drop below freezing.

Environmental, Social and Safety
 Our operations, and the operations of certain of our customers, are subject to numerous federal and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and transportation. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, storm water and the management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances.  We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.  However, failure by us to comply with applicable environmental and other requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, remediation actions, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We have adopted Environmental and Social Commitment Policies outlining our commitment to environmental responsibility and accountability and our commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights and labor standards. These policies apply to the company as a whole, our customers, and our vendors and suppliers and are available on our website. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented a number of measures to promote workplace safety. Customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions due to increased regulations to report all incidents that occur at their sites and the costs associated with such incidents.
Cybersecurity
 We believe that we have implemented appropriate preventative measures to avert and mitigate the effects of cyber-attacks; however, like other companies, the measures that we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all cybersecurity breaches. We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware, computer virus attacks and phishing attempts. We monitor regional regulatory requirements to ensure compliance and to continually improve our processes. Additionally, in the event we encounter any suspected cybersecurity issues, we have a robust response plan, including controls over the sales of securities by executives and those with knowledge of any cybersecurity issues to prevent insider trading on non-public information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. While we carry robust cybersecurity insurance, costs and consequences of a cybersecurity incident could include remediation expenses, lost revenues, litigation, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage and erosion of shareholder value. Our Board regularly reviews our cybersecurity risks and controls with senior management.  We have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach.
