Overview
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors for diseases with significant unmet need. We apply our insights into the chemistry and biology of proteases to develop orally delivered, small molecule inhibitors with high selectivity, potency and bioavailability that we believe will make them successful treatments for diseases. We have used these capabilities to develop a proprietary portfolio of novel, small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors targeting hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”). In late 2020, we also announced a novel, oral Factor XIIa (“Factor XIIa”) inhibitor program, which initially is being advanced to provide a next generation of HAE therapeutics and which also offers the opportunity for expansion into other high unmet need indications in the future.
 Our primary focus is currently on developing oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE, for which we have two drug program candidates in clinical trials. HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with symptoms that include episodes of debilitating and often painful swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. Despite having multiple therapies approved, we believe HAE patients are in need of alternatives that better meet their objectives for quality of life and ease of disease control. Other than one therapy recently approved for 
 1

prophylaxis, currently marketed therapies are all administered by injection, which patients can find challenging despite their efficacy because they can be painful, time consuming to deliver and difficult to store. We anticipate that there will be strong interest in safe and effective, orally delivered, small molecule treatments, and our strategy is to develop oral drug candidates for both on-demand and prophylactic use with the goal of providing patients with a complete set of oral options to treat their disease.
 Our strategy is based upon extensive patient, physician and payer research to identify the key needs in the market. According to our market research, oral therapy remains the highest unmet need, with 93% of patients surveyed by KalVista expressing a willingness to switch to oral therapy for both on-demand and prophylactic use. Importantly however, the survey data shows that patients are not prepared to accept significantly reduced efficacy or safety with a switch to oral therapy, and so we place a high degree of emphasis on advancing program candidates that we believe can compare favorably to existing approved therapies in both those dimensions. 
 
We have advanced our candidate KVD900 into later stage clinical development as a potential oral, on-demand therapy for HAE attacks. In February 2021 we announced data from a Phase 2 efficacy trial in which KVD900 demonstrated statistically and clinically significant responses across all primary and secondary endpoints. KVD900-201 was a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial investigating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of 600 mg KVD900 as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Following an open label phase, in which pharmacokinetic samples were collected over four hours, all patients progressed into the randomized phase of the trial. In this “at home” part of the trial, patients treated two attacks, one with 600 mg KVD900 and one with placebo in a randomized sequence. Patients administered treatment for each attack within one hour of attack onset, following confirmation with their physician, and then recorded symptoms and, if needed, the time to use of rescue (the patient’s conventional attack treatment). The time to use of rescue treatment within 12 hours was the primary outcome of the trial. Secondary outcomes included assessment of attack severity using categorical (“PGI-S”) and visual analogue scale (“VAS”) measures and the patient’s global impression of change (“PGI-C”).
 
The trial planned to complete at least 50 patients and enrolled 68 patients of which 53 completed the trial by treating two attacks. One patient withdrew consent and 14 patients were discontinued due to completion of the trial. No patients withdrew due to adverse events.
 
The trial met its primary endpoint comparing the time to use of rescue treatment within 12 hours on KVD900 versus placebo (p=0.001) with rates of use at 12 hours of 15.1% following treatment with KVD900 versus 30.2% after placebo. The trial also met all secondary endpoints: reduced worsening of attacks (p<0.0001; based on PGI-S or use of rescue) and reduced time to onset of symptom relief measured using both PGI-C (p<0.0001) and VAS (p<0.0001). The trial included 126 administrations of KVD900 and 55 of placebo. During the uncontrolled, open label phase, 5 of 68 patients dosed reported 8 adverse events suspected to be related to treatment. During the randomized, placebo-controlled phase, 5 patients reported adverse events suspected to be treatment-related (3 of 58 dosed with KVD900 and 2 of 55 dosed with placebo). We have scheduled an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA to confirm our plans for the Phase 3 program, following which we are prepared to commence the trial rapidly in the US. We also intend for this trial to be conducted in a number of other countries, with commencement in those locations to follow approval by their respective regulatory authorities. KVD900 has received Fast Track designation from the FDA. A Pediatric Investigational Plan (“PIP”) has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for KVD900.
 
KVD824 is our oral product candidate being developed for potential prophylactic treatment of HAE. Our work to optimize the exposure profile of KVD824 has yielded a formulation that maintains the plasma concentrations we believe are required to deliver efficacy that will compete with approved injectable therapies. Twice-daily dosing of this formulation of KVD824 up to 14 days has shown what we believe to be an encouraging safety and tolerability profile.
 
In April 2021 we announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold our Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for a Phase 2 clinical trial of KVD824. The FDA letter request further information and analysis related to certain preclinical studies of KVD824 submitted to support the planned Phase 2 trial. Refinements were also proposed to the intended KVD824 Phase 2 study protocol. No new studies were requested nor was it suggested that new data be generated to initiate the Phase 2 trial. We are currently working to provide the additional 
 2

information and analysis requested by the FDA while also progressing regulatory filings for other countries where we also plan to initiate sites for the Phase 2. We currently intend to submit our response to the FDA in the third calendar quarter of 2021.
 
We initially evaluated KVD824 in a three-part first-in-human study in which 84 healthy male, adult subjects received at least one dose of KVD824. The study evaluated single doses up to 1,280 mg, multiple doses up to 640 mg, and the effect of food on KVD824 pharmacokinetics. We have also completed a study in healthy adult subjects assessing different formulations of KVD824 and believe that twice-daily dosing maintains concentrations sufficient to deliver meaningful clinical efficacy.
 
To date, a total of 121 subjects have been exposed to treatment with KVD824 as single doses up to 1,280 mg and up to 14 days of twice-daily dosing of 600 mg and 900 mg. In the first-in-human study adverse event rates were similar in placebo and active arms, no subjects withdrew from the study and no serious adverse events were reported. All reported adverse events have been mild and no subjects withdrew from the trial.
 
Our oral Factor XIIa inhibitor program represents what we believe is a major breakthrough in development of a therapeutic against an important target. Factor XIIa is an enzyme that plays a key role in HAE as the most upstream mechanism in the biochemical pathway that initiates HAE attacks. For this reason, we believe that inhibition of Factor XIIa will block the underlying causes of HAE attacks, including the uncontrolled generation of both plasma kallikrein and bradykinin, which cause swelling and pain. Clinical studies of an injectable Factor XIIa-inhibitory antibody have demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in preventing HAE attacks, and there are no known safety implications of long-term inhibition of this enzyme. We believe that our program has the potential to be the first orally delivered Factor XIIa inhibitor to enter clinical development, initially for HAE and over time for additional indications that are supported by scientific evidence.
 
Our internal research team has discovered multiple series of low nanomolar potency Factor XIIa inhibitors that are both selective and orally bioavailable. We are pursuing comprehensive intellectual property protection for this advanced medicinal chemistry program that is currently in lead optimization. We anticipate initiating IND-enabling studies for potential drug candidates in 2021.
 
The second indication we are pursuing is DME. DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in most developed countries and diabetes, the underlying cause of DME, is the leading cause of blindness among American adults according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Our DME program to date has been focused on the development of an intravitreally administered small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor, KVD001, which completed a Phase 2 trial. We believe intravitreal plasma kallikrein inhibitors may be an effective alternative therapy to vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) inhibitors and further improve visual acuity and decrease macular thickening. We also intend to develop oral therapies for DME, which we believe would represent a substantial enhancement to the therapeutic options with this disease. We are currently evaluating our development strategy in this indication and expect to provide further updates when appropriate. 
 Strategy
 Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Apply our deep scientific expertise in the area of serine proteases to develop novel oral therapies for indications with high unmet need. Our core scientific team has decades of experience working on protease inhibitors and developing compounds with high potency, selectivity and bioavailability. We have assembled a team of chemists and biologists who have demonstrated the ability to design and formulate multiple drug candidate programs from a broad variety of chemical classes, as indicated by our extensive intellectual property portfolio. Our initial focus is specifically on development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE and DME; however, we believe our scientific capabilities also can be applied to other proteases to develop therapies for diseases with high unmet need and orphan indications.

• | Develop multiple HAE product candidates to provide a full set of therapeutic options for patients.

options to treat their disease. Our most advanced program for HAE is KVD900, which is being developed as a potential oral, on-demand therapy for treatment of HAE attacks. In February 2021 we announced data from a Phase 2 efficacy trial in which KVD900 demonstrated statistically and clinically significant responses across all primary and secondary endpoints, and we are currently preparing for an FDA meeting following which we intend to commence a Phase 3 trial. KVD824 is our next oral candidate to be developed as a potential oral prophylactic treatment for HAE. In April 2021 we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on our IND for a Phase 2 clinical trial of KVD824. We are currently working to provide the additional information and analysis requested by the FDA and intend to commence the planned Phase 2 study once such clearance is provided. With our recently announced Factor XIIa inhibitor program, we believe we may be able to offer patients a next generation of HAE therapies that may further enhance their options.

• | Continue to advance our DME programs, including developing an oral therapy. KVD001, our first product candidate to treat DME, completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2019. We also intend to develop an oral therapy for this indication, which we believe could dramatically improve the standard of care for patients, since all current therapies are delivered by injection into the eye.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow our capabilities internally as well as through strategic partnerships. We intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key milestones and in certain markets. For certain indications, such as HAE, that can be addressed by a focused organization, we intend to keep all program rights and develop internal sales and marketing capabilities. For programs that address larger markets or require greater infrastructure or resources, we may seek a partner that can provide those capabilities. Decisions on whether, and when, to engage in partnerships or collaborations will be based upon our evaluations of the relative risks and rewards of those collaborations at each point in the development cycle.

 Plasma Kallikrein in HAE and DME 
 Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease enzyme that is a key early mediator of inflammation and edema. The body modulates the inflammatory effects of plasma kallikrein through a circulating inhibitor protein called C1-esterase inhibitor (“C1-INH”). Most patients with HAE have genetic mutations that lead to C1-INH deficiency, which results in an inability to control activated plasma kallikrein in affected tissues. This excessive activation leads to inflammation, edema, and pain. 
 Published laboratory work has shown that the vitreous fluid of the eye is also a site of increased plasma kallikrein in DME. In diabetic patients, the retina is one of a few tissues in which edema develops. Under normal circumstances the eye is protected from the diffusion of plasma proteins by an effective blood vessel barrier. In diabetes this barrier becomes less effective and allows plasma proteins such as plasma kallikrein to enter the retina and vitreous. While C1-INH can also to enter by the same route, animal models of DME have shown that the concentration of C1-INH in the vitreous fluid is insufficient to fully suppress the effects of plasma kallikrein on retinal edema. Over time, this edema leads to retinal damage that causes blindness.
 Hereditary Angioedema 
 Disease Overview
 HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people, according to published information from an HAE patient advocacy group. Excessive plasma kallikrein activation that is not sufficiently controlled by C1-INH leads to HAE attacks, which can vary with regard to the affected tissue or organ and severity. HAE attacks include episodes of intense swelling usually in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. They often lead to temporary disfiguration of various body parts including the hands, feet, face, body trunk, and genitals. In addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that is caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation.
 Attacks can occur spontaneously although they often are associated with anxiety, stress, minor trauma, surgery, or illnesses. Commonly patients are alerted to an impending attack by prodromal symptoms which include 
 4

rash, fatigue, and muscle aches. Trauma to the oral cavity caused by dental procedures makes HAE patients particularly vulnerable to airway attacks. The frequency of HAE attacks is highly variable, with some patients having attacks several times per week and others very infrequently. Population studies have shown that the median number of attacks per month for patients is approximately one, and approximately 90% of patients have two or fewer attacks per month. Although life-threatening airway swelling is rare, at least half of HAE patients have experienced at least one such attack and airway attacks remain a major cause of mortality in HAE patients. The severity of attacks is unpredictable and not related to their underlying frequency. A patient with only one attack per year can nevertheless be at risk of suffering a laryngeal attack. 
 
HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that a defect in only one copy of the gene leads to symptoms and that it occurs at similar rates in both males and females. The most common cause of HAE is a defect or mutation in the gene responsible for the production of C1-INH. While HAE most often results from the inheritance of a defective gene from a parent, it is estimated that up to 25% of cases also arise from spontaneous mutations. Patients with C1-INH-related disease are classified as Type 1 or Type 2; Type 1 is the most common form and results in low levels of circulating C1-INH and Type 2 results in production of a low function protein. An additional form of HAE, sometimes called normal C1-INH HAE, can occur in patients with normal levels of C1-INH for a variety of reasons including mutations in genes for Factor 12, plasminogen or angiopoetin. Moreover, bradykinin-induced acute attacks of angioedema can occur idiopathically in individuals for which a hereditary cause has not yet been identified. Excessive formation of bradykinin can also be caused by increased circulation of estrogens, reduced elimination of bradykinin, or through use of drugs such as ACE inhibitors. 
 C1-INH is a natural plasma-borne protein that is an inhibitor of multiple serine proteases in both the complement and kallikrein kinin systems. C1-INH is the predominant physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, and thereby suppresses the generation of bradykinin, a potent hormone produced by plasma kallikrein, that activates its receptors on blood vessels to increase vascular leakage. Uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity leads to the edema that is the hallmark of HAE. Selective plasma kallikrein inhibitors and a bradykinin receptor antagonist are approved therapies for HAE. As such, plasma kallikrein is a clinically validated target for HAE and previous studies have demonstrated that plasma kallikrein inhibition can both treat and prevent HAE attacks.
 Current Treatments and Market Opportunities
 There are a number of marketed and development stage therapeutics for HAE which provide evidence that inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity will give therapeutic benefit in HAE. Takyzyro® is a monoclonal antibody against plasma kallikrein indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE. The prescribing information recommends subcutaneous administration every two weeks, though dosing at more extended intervals may be considered in some patients. Ecallantide (Kalbitor®) is a small protein inhibitor of plasma kallikrein that is approved for treatment of acute attacks of HAE. While effective, ecallantide has been associated with cases of anaphylaxis and its approval by the FDA includes a black box warning limiting its administration to healthcare professionals. Other therapies provide C1-INH replacement to control plasma kallikrein levels. Marketed C1-INH replacement therapies include Cinryze® and Haegarda® for prophylaxis, and Berinert® for treatment of acute attacks, all of which are purified from human plasma, and Ruconest® which is a recombinant product also for treatment of acute attacks. Icatibant (Firazyr®) is a synthetic peptide-based antagonist that blocks the activity of bradykinin and is indicated for treatment of acute attacks. All of these products are administered by injection, which is typically less convenient for patients and has the potential to reduce compliance. Berotralstat (ORLADEYOTM) is a newly approved oral prophylactic treatment which in clinical trials had inferior efficacy when compared to injectables. As a result of the lifelong nature of HAE and the challenges related to taking many of the injected therapies, patient surveys consistently indicate an overwhelming desire of patients for an oral therapy. We believe that a safe and effective oral agent has the potential to transform treatment for this disease. We also believe that opportunities exist for both acute and prophylactic treatments, and we intend to develop drug candidates for both on-demand and prophylactic use, with the goal of providing patients with a complete set of oral options to treat their disease.
 We believe a further future market opportunity may exist in treatment of normal C1-INH HAE. Estimates of the size of this patient population vary widely, but we believe that the nature of normal C1-INH HAE disease may make prophylaxis less attractive for these patients than a safe and rapidly effective on-demand plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy.

Our Portfolio of HAE Programs
 
Our strategy is to evaluate and develop multiple oral molecules in pursuit of best-in-class therapies for HAE patients, with an initial focus on treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 HAE. The first of these product candidates being evaluated in later stage clinical trials is KVD900. A positive Phase 2 clinical trial for KVD900 as a potential on-demand treatment for HAE attacks was completed in February 2021. Our second oral treatment in development for potential prophylactic treatment for HAE is KVD824.
 KVD900
 The first clinical study of KVD900 was a multi-part trial consisting of a single ascending dose phase, a formulation cross-over phase, and investigation of food effect in 84 healthy, male volunteers. Doses up to 600 mg were tested in this study using both capsule and tablet formulation, with the tablet as the intended formulation for future development. Data from the single ascending dose phase of the study showed that KVD900 tablets were rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and achieved blood levels that we believe are sufficient for efficacy within as little as 10 minutes at the higher dose levels, and essentially complete inhibition of plasma kallikrein was observed within 30 minutes. Food effect studies showed little impact of fed state on the pharmacodynamic profile of KVD900 tablets, delivering 95% inhibition within 30 minutes. There were no severe adverse events (“SAE”) reported and single doses of KVD900 up to 600 mg were generally well-tolerated in this study.
 Evidence from studies using therapies approved for the treatment of acute HAE attacks shows that earlier treatment has a powerful impact on the efficacy outcomes. Despite clear evidence that early treatment markedly reduces attack duration, treatment is often delayed. In one outcome study of 207 HAE attacks, attack duration was 2.75-fold shorter when treatment was administered within 1 hour of attack onset (6.1 hours versus 16.8 hours (p<0.001)), yet treatment was administered more than 1 hour after attack onset in nearly 60% of attacks, and for 30% of attacks treatment was administered more than five hours after attack onset. We believe this delay in administration is due to many factors including the inconvenience of preparation and administration as well as the discomfort of injectable therapies. An oral therapy has the potential to overcome these and lower the barrier for treatment for patients. The combination of the rapid uptake of KVD900 to very high blood levels and the likelihood of earlier dosing by patients, could lead to much better disease management and prevention of attacks reaching the critical stage of significant swelling and discomfort. We therefore believe that a safe, oral on-demand treatment has the potential to become a preferred alternative for patients currently using injectable treatments, including both acute and prophylactic therapies. 
 In 2020 we completed a multiple dose study of KVD900 that was designed to explore the safety and pharmacokinetics of repeat dosing over differing timeframes. A total of 42 healthy male and female subjects were included in the study, consisting of 30 active and 12 placebo. Study subjects received a total dose of 1800 mg KVD900 given as 3x600 mg doses at intervals of 8 hours (6 active, 2 placebo), 4 hours (6 active, 2 placebo) or 2 hours (18 active and 8 placebo). 
 The study showed that dosing every two hours achieved maximum concentrations of KVD900 approximately three times the maximum concentration of a single 600 mg dose. All reported AEs were mild and resolved without intervention. The incidence of adverse events was similar between KVD900-treated and placebo-treated cohorts. The protocol also included continuous cardiac monitoring of subjects. There was no clinically significant effect of KVD900 treatment on any electrocardiogram parameters.
 In February 2021 we announced data from a Phase 2 efficacy trial in which KVD900 demonstrated statistical and clinically significant responses across all primary and secondary endpoints. KVD900-201 was a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial investigating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of 600 mg KVD900 as an on-demand treatment for HAE attacks in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 HAE. Following an open label phase, in which pharmacokinetic samples were collected over four hours, all patients progressed into the randomized phase of the trial. In this “at home” part of the trial, patients treated two attacks, one with 600 mg KVD900 and one with placebo in a randomized sequence. Patients administered treatment for each attack within one hour of attack onset, following confirmation with their physician, and then recorded symptoms and, if needed, the time to use of rescue (the patient’s conventional attack treatment). The time to rescue treatment within 12 hours was the primary outcome 
 6

of the trial. Secondary outcomes included assessment of attack severity using categorical (PGI-S) and visual analogue scale (VAS) measures and the patient’s global impression of change (PGI-C).
 
The trial planned to complete at least 50 patients and enrolled 68 patients of which 53 completed the trial by treating two attacks. One patient withdrew consent and 14 patients were discontinued due to completion of the trial. No patients withdrew due to adverse events.
 The trial met its primary endpoint comparing the time to use of rescue treatment within 12 hours on KVD900 versus placebo (p=0.001) with rates of use at 12 hours of 15.1% following treatment with KVD900 versus 30.2% after placebo. The trial also met all secondary endpoints: reduced worsening of attacks (p<0.0001; PGI-S or use of rescue) and reduced time to onset of symptom relief measured using both PGI-C (p<0.0001) and VAS (p<0.0001). The trial included 126 administrations of KVD900 and 55 of placebo. During the uncontrolled, open label phase, 5 of 68 patients dosed reported 8 adverse events suspected to be related to treatment. During the randomized, placebo-controlled phase, 5 patients reported adverse events suspected to be treatment-related (3 of 58 dosed with KVD900 and 2 of 55 dosed with placebo). We have scheduled an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to confirm our plans for the Phase 3 program, following which we are prepared to commence the trial rapidly in the US. We also intend for this trial to be conducted in a number of other countries, with commencement in those locations to follow approval by their respective regulatory authorities. KVD900 has received Fast Track designation from the FDA. A Pediatric Investigational Plan (“PIP”) has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for KVD900.
 KVD824
 KVD824 is our oral product candidate which is being developed for potential prophylactic treatment of HAE. Our work to optimize the exposure profile of KVD824 has yielded a formulation that maintains the plasma concentrations we believe are required to deliver efficacy that will compete with approved injectable therapies. Twice-daily dosing of this formulation of KVD824 up to 14 days has shown what we believe to be an encouraging safety and tolerability profile.
 We initially evaluated KVD824 in a three-part first-in-human study in which 84 healthy male, adult subjects received at least one dose of KVD824. The study evaluated single doses up to 1,280 mg, multiple doses up to 640 mg, and the effect of food on KVD824 pharmacokinetics. We have also completed a study in healthy adult subjects assessing different formulations of KVD824 and believe that twice-daily dosing maintains concentrations sufficient to deliver meaningful clinical efficacy.
 To date, a total of 121 subjects have been exposed to treatment with KVD824 as single doses up to 1,280 mg and up to 14 days of twice-daily dosing of 600 mg and 900 mg. In the first-in-human study adverse event rates were similar in placebo and active arms, no subjects withdrew from the study and no serious adverse events were reported. All reported adverse events have been mild and no subjects withdrew from the trial. 
 All of our initial clinical development related to KVD824 was conducted in the U.K. To conduct our planned Phase 2 clinical trial in the US, we filed our first US IND for KVD824 in early 2021. In April 2021 we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on our IND. The FDA letter request further information and analysis related to certain preclinical studies of KVD824 submitted to support the planned Phase 2 trial. Refinements were also proposed to the intended KVD824 Phase 2 study protocol. No new studies were requested nor was it suggested that new data be generated to initiate the Phase 2 trial. We are currently working to provide the additional information and analysis requested by the FDA while also continuing to make regulatory filings in other countries where we plan to initiate sites for the Phase 2. We currently intend to submit our response to the FDA in the third calendar quarter of 2021.

Factor XIIa
 Our recently announced oral Factor XIIa inhibitor program represents what we believe is a major breakthrough in development of a therapeutic against an important target. Factor XIIa is an enzyme that plays a key role in HAE as the most upstream mechanism in the biochemical pathway that initiates HAE attacks. For this reason, we believe that inhibition of Factor XIIa will block the underlying causes of HAE attacks, including the uncontrolled generation of both plasma kallikrein and bradykinin, which cause swelling and pain. Clinical studies of an injectable Factor XIIa-inhibitory antibody have demonstrated efficacy in preventing HAE attacks, and there are no known safety implications of long-term inhibition of this enzyme. We believe that our program has the potential to be the first orally delivered Factor XIIa inhibitor to enter clinical development, initially for HAE and over time for additional indications that are supported by scientific evidence.
 Our internal research team has discovered multiple series of low nanomolar potency Factor XIIa inhibitors that are selective and orally bioavailable. We are currently in the lead optimization phase of compounds that display pharmacokinetic profiles consistent with our target for once-daily oral dosing that we believe can lead to clinical candidates. In parallel with advancing medicinal chemistry for our Factor XIIa inhibitors, we are characterizing the PK/PD properties of certain of our compounds in preclinical models of angioedema. ACE inhibitor captopril-induced vascular leakage of Evans blue dye is a well-characterized model of bradykinin-mediated angioedema in mice. Captopril increases vascular leakage in the larynx (3.4 fold) and colon (3.1 fold) in mice compared with controls receiving saline. Factor XII knockout mice are fully protected from captopril-induced vascular leakage, demonstrating that Factor XII is required for vascular permeability in this model. We show that treatment of mice with our selective small molecule Factor XIIa inhibitor KV998083 at 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg reduced captopril induced leakage in larynx by 65% (p=0.013), 84% (p=0.001) and 104% (p<0.001), compared to captopril alone. In the colon, this dosing regimen reduced captopril induced leakage by 27% (n.s), 50% (p=0.027) and 112% (p<0.001). These results demonstrate that Factor XIIa inhibition with KV998083 protects against bradykinin-mediated angioedema an established preclinical model.
 


We have not yet determined whether KV998083 will be advanced as a program candidate, as we have multiple preclinical compounds under evaluation and we have established a strict set of criteria for candidate selection. We anticipate initiating IND-enabling studies for one or more of those potential Factor XIIa inhibitor program candidates in 2021.

Diabetic Macular Edema 
 
Disease Overview 
 DME occurs as a complication of diabetes and is caused by the breakdown of the endothelial barrier function in the retina, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the macula. This leads to edematous thickening of the macula region of the retina and loss of visual acuity, potentially leading to blindness. DME is a major complication associated with diabetes, affecting an estimated 26% of type 1 diabetic patients after 14 years of the disease, and an estimated 29% over their lifetime; 17% of type 1 diabetic patients were estimated to develop clinically significant macular edema over their lifetime. Approximately 900,000 patients in the United States have active DME and are at serious risk of vision loss, according to a study published in 2015.
 The current standard of care for DME in the United States is therapy directed against VEGF, a hypoxia-induced protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels in the retina. FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies for DME are ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®). Both of these products are administered via intravitreal injection at roughly monthly intervals. In addition to treatment by these two products, a large fraction of patients is treated with bevacizumab (Avastin®), another therapy that works through the same mechanism of binding to VEGF but has not been approved for ophthalmic use. Bevacizumab is priced based on its application in oncology and off-label use by retinal specialists typically results in treatment at a fraction of the cost seen with both ranibizumab and aflibercept. Patients are also treated with laser therapy in some circumstances, as well as a number of other drug therapies including corticosteroid anti-inflammatories.
 In a recent large, multi-center clinical trial in DME patients, anti-VEGF therapy led to approximately 20% of patients improving their visual acuity by 15 letters or more after a median of 9 or 10 intravitreal injections, leaving a significant portion of the patients with inadequate control of their disease. Further, in one study conducted for an approved anti-VEGF, 40% of patients displayed minimal improvement in visual acuity following anti-VEGF therapy after months of treatment. Certain corticosteroid treatments have led to 15-letter improvements in visual acuity in approximately 20-30% of patients. However, corticosteroid treatments are associated with a dramatic increase in cataract formation and a rise in intraocular pressure, reducing the attractiveness of these agents as potential therapies in many patients.
 Research into the biology underlying DME by our scientific team has identified plasma kallikrein as a potential novel target for this indication. KalVista scientists were the first to identify increased concentrations of plasma kallikrein in vitreous fluid samples obtained from individuals with diabetic retinopathy and DME and have pioneered the development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of this disease. Our group has established preclinical models to investigate the role of plasma kallikrein in both VEGF-independent and VEGF-mediated DME as well as for underlying pathologies associated with diabetic retinopathy. We have used this in-depth knowledge of the plasma kallikrein system, diabetic retinopathy, and clinical ophthalmology to evaluate the effects of orally available plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of DME. Using a pharmacology platform, originally developed and validated using plasma kallikrein knockout mice at the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, we have screened and characterized the pharmacodynamic effects of KalVista’s oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors. We were the first to demonstrate that plasma kallikrein inhibition and gene knockout are protective against VEGF-induced retinal edema.
 Using subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps we have quantified the dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effect of plasma kallikrein inhibitors on VEGF-induced retinal edema and have correlated these effects with both plasma and retinal drug concentrations. Moreover, using gavage we have characterized the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects of orally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitors on retinal edema. These models and protocols have enabled detailed characterization and comparison of the effects of multiple oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors on retinal edema.

KVD001
 Our first potential DME therapy is KVD001. KVD001 is a potent inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein with a Ki of approximately 10 nM and a high degree of selectivity against a broad range of other proteases. We have developed KVD001 for intravitreal injection because we believe that trials using this delivery modality will provide a relatively early and direct proof-of-concept since the molecule is delivered directly to the site of edema. Since other products such as anti-VEGF therapies are also delivered intravitreally, we believe this will be accepted by both physicians and patients and will not lead to any competitive disadvantages. Another inherent advantage of intravitreal administration is that there is very limited systemic exposure, thus reducing potential systemic safety concerns.
 
In December 2019 we announced data from a Phase 2 trial for KVD001. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of two dose levels (3μg and 6μg) of KVD001 compared to a sham control in 129 DME patients who had previously been treated with anti-VEGF therapy, and still had significant edema and reduced visual acuity. The primary efficacy endpoint of change in best corrected visual acuity (“BCVA”) at 16 weeks compared to sham was not met. No significant differences were observed in the secondary endpoints of central subfield thickness or the diabetic retinopathy severity scale. KVD001 was generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In the overall study population, KVD001 demonstrated a protection against vision loss. In the sham treated group 54.5% of patients experienced a reduction in vision compared to 32.5% in the 6μg dose (p=0.042). The study also included a pre-specified subgroup analysis investigating the impact of baseline visual acuity on response. After excluding those patients with the most severe vision loss (visual acuity of <55 letters at baseline), the remaining 70% of the total patient population showed a difference in BCVA compared to sham of 4.9 letters (p=0.056) at the 6μg dose.
 
We continue to believe that the results of the KVD001 Phase 2 study suggest a patient population in which plasma kallikrein inhibition may yield vision benefits, and we intend to explore further development opportunities for this and oral DME programs over time.
 Potential for Oral DME Therapies 
 In parallel with the clinical development of our intravitreal product candidate KVD001, we intend to identify and advance plasma kallikrein inhibitors as oral therapies for DME. We believe that a safe and effective oral therapy has the potential to transform the treatment of DME which to date has been dominated by drug therapies that must be injected intravitreally. Future trials in DME with oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors may focus on the treatment of earlier stage disease, a stage at which intravitreal injections are not a desirable solution due to their inherently invasive nature and consequent risk of adverse reactions.
 
Competition
 In treating HAE, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including Takhzyro and Cinryze, marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited (“Takeda”) in the United States and Europe for the prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents; Firazyr, marketed by Takeda in the United States, Europe and certain other geographic territories for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; Kalbitor, an injectable plasma kallikrein inhibitor marketed by Takeda for the resolution of acute attacks in adolescent and adult HAE patients; Berinert, marketed by CSL Behring for treatment of acute abdominal, facial or laryngeal attacks of HAE in adults and adolescents, and Haegarda, also marketed by CSL Behring, for prophylaxis; Ruconest, marketed by Pharming Group for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; and Orladeyo, an oral prophylactic treatment marketed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are also aware of other companies that are engaged in the clinical development of other HAE treatments, including Pharvaris GmbH,  Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We are aware of several other companies in preclinical development of potential HAE therapies. 
 In treating DME, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including anti-VEGF therapies Lucentis, marketed by Roche Holding AG (“Roche”) and Novartis International AG (“Novartis”), Eylea, marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (“Regeneron”), and off-label use of Avastin from Roche. We also face competition from various corticoid steroids including extended release formulations lluvien, marketed by 
 10

Alimera Sciences, Inc., and Ozurdex, marketed by Allergan plc. We further expect to compete with generic corticosteroids such as fluocinolone acetonide, and dexamethasone and we are aware of a number of other companies that have product candidates in clinical trials, including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche, Regeneron, Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc., Aerpio Therapeutics, Oxurion NV and Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success substantially depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.

 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We require 
 11

our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive confidential information or materials.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 FDA approval process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDA”), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence in the United States, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and manufacturing process, as well as toxicity studies in animals to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices and good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with the information on product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. For the initial IND submission, a 30-day waiting period after the submission of the IND is required prior to the commencement of the clinical trial in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. For subsequent clinical trial protocols submitted to the IND, there is no mandated review time for FDA. Longer duration pre-clinical studies, for example animal tests of reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity, if required, will be conducted and submitted to the IND throughout the development of the product until sufficient data is available to support submission of an NDA. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for 
 12

approval prior to the start of the clinical trial. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dose, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious or life-threatening outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. 
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life- threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical and clinical data, including pharmacology and toxicology results, and the results of other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, and once approved, the NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA. Priority review can be applied to a drug that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the compliance of manufacturing facilities with GMP, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such additional data in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for the indication being supported. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) if it is considered that additional measures are needed to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include the use of medication guides and communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. 
 13

Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Foreign clinical studies to support an NDA 
 The FDA will accept as support for marketing approval of a product (NDA) well-designed, well-conducted, clinical studies conducted outside of the United States if the studies have been conducted in accordance with the exact same standards of GCP, as required in the United States, and the protocol was submitted to the IND. FDA may validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Clinical studies conducted outside the United States are subject to the same rigorous regulatory controls as the United States (see “— Europe / rest of world government regulation” below).
 A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical study to support an IND must submit documentation to the FDA to demonstrate compliance with GCP. The FDA may also request to inspect a foreign clinical study site to confirm compliance.
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation if a compound has the potential to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested prior to submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the compound and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process of an NDA. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a drug product containing a compound that has FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that drug product for that orphan indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a drug product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a drug product containing a different active moiety for the same disease or condition, or the same drug product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA user fee. 
 Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
 Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
 14

Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has 
 15

been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. In addition, the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are subject to change.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 16

Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. Certain local jurisdictions also require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Sales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third party payors

provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 U.S. Healthcare reform 
 In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. For example, in March 2010, the presidential administration signed into law the ACA, which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. 
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: 
  
• | subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (now 70%) off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the United States, there have also been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Following January 2017, the presidential administration issued two executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on October 12, 2017, the presidential administration issued an executive order that expands the use of association health plans and allows anyone to purchase short-term health plans that provide temporary, limited insurance. This executive order also called for the halt of federal payments to health insurers for cost-sharing reductions previously available to lower-income Americans to afford coverage. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact this executive order could have on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, among other things, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. It is uncertain how healthcare measures of the current presidential administration will impact the ACA and our business. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current presidential administration and the Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the ACA. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our products, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

There has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the former presidential administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders, and policy initiatives. It is unclear whether the current administration will work to reverse those measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the generation revenue, attainment profitability, or commercialization of products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm the business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 Europe / rest of world government regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country in the European Union. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

To obtain regulatory approval of a drug product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The documentation submitted to the FDA in support of an NDA in the United States is almost identical to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other regulations 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of April 30, 2021, we had a total of 70 full-time employees, of whom 28 were located in the United States, 41 were located in the United Kingdom, and 1 was located in Switzerland. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, and we provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In July 2021, the Company adopted an Equity Inducement Plan in order to provide incentives to attract and motivate employees through the grant of stock options and restricted share units.
