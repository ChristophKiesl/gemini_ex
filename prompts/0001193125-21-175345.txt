The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing massive changes at an unprecedented rate. Our mission is to help accelerate its transformation to a value-based care system from which everyone benefits. We deliver solutions and products that help increase efficiency, improve outcomes, and enhance consumer engagement throughout the consumer healthcare journey. That journey has three major stages: 
 

 | The Pre-Visit, which includes provider selection, scheduling an appointment, ensuring coverage and pre-authorization, medical record sharing and review, and understanding required payments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 


 
 | The Visit (or visits), during which financial clearance is provided, imaging and other clinical activities are managed, and medical necessity is ensured.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Post-Visit, which typically requires the resolution of payment, claims remittance and processing, and on-going patient engagement. This stage is increasingly important today as the industry moves toward value-based care and payment models.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our mission to accelerate transformation of the healthcare system requires us to support all three stages with solutions that address the clinical, financial, and engagement requirements of the journey. 
 Our analytics-driven solutions are designed to improve delivery of care through better clinical decision-making, and to simplify billing and payment functions by reducing administrative errors and improving documentation. In addition, we seek to improve payers and providers relationships with consumers by offering solutions that enable price transparency and empower their decision-making and support.

Market Opportunity 
 We compete in the market for data and analytics-driven solutions that help ensure clinically appropriate care, increase efficiency and reduce waste in the healthcare industry. We believe the following trends impacting payers, providers and consumers represent a significant opportunity for us. 
 Wasteful spending amidst rising costs in the U.S. healthcare system. 
 Research cited by the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that the estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion, accounting for approximately 25% of total health care spending in 2019. Examples of waste include failure to adhere to best care practices and lack of care coordination, which leads to unnecessary readmissions and inappropriate levels of care delivery. Wasteful spending includes significant variation among providers in the cost and quality of similar care from provider to provider, and market to market (not explained by geography alone), and also includes overtreatment, which is testing and care that is not medically beneficial. 
 Additionally, the U.S. healthcare system relies on many inefficient processes that are manual, complex, frequently changing, time consuming, prone to error, costly, and requiring undue amounts of clinicians and other professionals time. In addition, improper payments, according to the Office of Management and Budget, represented approximately 6% of all Medicare Fee-for-Service and 21% of Medicaid payments in 2020. Such improper payments and fraudulent billing create costly and labor-intensive follow-up. According to the CMS, U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow from $3.8 trillion in 2019, or 18% of U.S. gross domestic product, to $6.2 trillion, or approximately 20% of U.S. gross domestic product, by 2028. This implies that healthcare 
 
7 


  spending is increasing at a 5.4% annual growth rate, or 3.4% higher than expected inflation over the same period. Given the significant and lasting financial burden of ongoing rising costs and wasteful spending, government, commercial payers, and providers are increasingly focused on reducing costs attributable to administrative complexity and errors; excessive manual labor; and uncoordinated, unproductive, or ineffective processes. As a result, we expect continued strong demand for solutions that can aid in reducing waste, improving efficiency, and help ensure delivery of clinically appropriate and value-based care. 
 Healthcare system exposure to growing chronically ill and higher risk populations. 
 While the overall U.S. population is expected to increase 6.8% from 2020 to 2030, the population of adults age 65 and older is expected to increase 30.5% over the same period, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As the countrys elderly population continues to grow, and the healthcare system serves more chronically ill and higher risk populations, providers and payers will need tools to onboard and manage these populations. These include the ability to deliver appropriate care for medically complex patients, and the ability to document risk and outcomes to attain the appropriate reimbursement rates associated with these populations. 
 Increasing prevalence of value-based care and alternative reimbursement models. 
 The traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model is viewed as having facilitated growth in healthcare spending beyond the value provided from additional services. In response, both public and private sectors are shifting towards alternative payment models that are designed to incentivize value and quality throughout an episode of care and the care continuum overall, which encompass most or all of the services provided to a patient to diagnose, treat, and manage a clinical condition before, during, and after care is delivered. In recent years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has set quality and value targets for certain Medicare value-based alternative payment models, and commercial payers are accelerating their focus in a similar fashion. These payment models require a high level of documentation, robust data, sophisticated payment attribution capabilities, and advanced analytics that can adapt to new rules and goals to ensure compliance. Further, solutions seek to optimize the design, implementation, and monitoring of care delivery throughout an episode of care. Many payers and providers are still building the capabilities, expertise, and administrative processes to manage these changes adequately. They are increasingly partnering with third parties to demonstrate the achievement of the outcomes required under these value-based payment models, which require a fundamentally different skillset and toolset than what they have deployed historically. 
 Increasing patient financial responsibility and consumerism in healthcare. 
 As healthcare expenditures have continued to rise, employers and health plans have shifted costs to patients through increased adoption of high-deductible health plans. Enrollment in high deductible health plans with a savings option (HDHP/SO) has increased over the past five years, from 24% of covered workers in 2015 to 31% in 2020, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. This trend is expected to continue. Increases in patient financial responsibility require providers to obtain payment from the patient before and after the point of care, which in turn requires more advanced billing and collection workflows. As providers become more consumer-oriented, they require increasingly sophisticated, dynamic, and personalized digital solutions, which generally necessitate scale for efficient implementation and cost-effectiveness. Likewise, as patient out-of-pocket costs continue to increase, they are becoming more quality- and cost-conscious consumers, likely to make more calculated decisions regarding their healthcare consumption. These empowered healthcare consumers are demanding price transparency, decision support, and access to medical records from their health plans to help them choose caregivers who deliver the highest quality care at the lowest price. Health plans are consequently partnering with third parties to provide their members with tools which enable them to assess quality and cost based on individual plan benefits. At the same time, providers seek to effectively communicate the quality and value of their services, determine patients upfront insurance eligibility, coverage, and ability to pay their portion of healthcare bills; and simplify the payment process to improve patient experience and satisfaction.

 Proliferation of healthcare data. 
 The U.S. government funded almost $40 billion of incentive payments to healthcare providers between 2011 and July 2018 to adopt EHR technology. This has resulted in 80% of physicians and 96% of hospitals in the U.S. having certified EHR systems as of 2017, according to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). These EHRs, other digitized healthcare data, and the increasing amount of personal health data generated from smartphones, wearables, and other devices have generated unprecedented amounts of healthcare data in the U.S. However, healthcare data is often siloed and unstructured, and has historically been difficult for all constituents to understand and use in a timely manner. Both healthcare professionals and consumers increasingly demand tools and solutions that standardize the transfer and collection of data, as well as the ability to mine and analyze it for actionable insights. Advancements in ML, AI, and data science are making it easier to cost-effectively utilize data at scale, in real-time, to identify actionable insights that help improve outcomes and decrease cost. As healthcare data can be used more effectively, we expect that leading technology companies will increasingly seek partners who can effectively develop new software and analytics solutions to help payers and providers improve workflows and deliver higher quality care at lower cost to consumers. 
 Responding to the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our economy and nearly brought the healthcare system to its knees. It exposed and exacerbated weaknesses in the U.S. healthcare systems clinical, financial, and technical infrastructure, including significant issues with clinical guidelines; patient access and capacity management; revenue stability; social determinants of health and care inequity; clinical data interoperability; telehealth coverage, access, and payment; staffing safety and remote work; contact tracing; gaps in value-based payment models and the impact on claims management; and, now, a safe and orderly return to normal. The pandemic highlighted the criticality of accelerating the transformation of the U.S. healthcare system by making it simpler, more accessible, more integrated and streamlined, and digitized for everyone. 
 As a provider of data and analytics-driven solutions for the U.S. healthcare system, we help embed our customers with their end-to-end, mission-critical daily workflows. 
 Our solutions support our customers core business functions, including member enrollment, patient access, treatment, documentation, reimbursement and payment, claims and financial management, and post-payment and communication.

In that area, we continue to enhance the only cloud-native enterprise imaging solution in the market, helping customers modernize their workflow infrastructure, reduce capital and operating costs, improve care coordination across specialties, and speed accurate clinical decisions. 
 Data stewardship and security.
 As the amount of data in healthcare grows and the ability to use that data becomes more essential to effective delivery, management, and administration, we expect data security to become increasingly important for our customers. Our history of delivering solutions while prioritizing data security and fidelity enables us to be the platform of choice for large customers and partners. We have multiple certifications on multiple offerings and we implement security procedures and policies informed by applicable law and recommended practices. We also aim to drive industry maturity through appointed leadership roles with HITRUST Alliance and Healthcare Information Security and Analysis Center. 
 Predictable revenue profile and attractive, scalable model.
 We have an attractive operating profile given the predictable, recurring nature of a significant portion of our revenue combined with a scalable financial model. Our revenue is largely derived from recurring transactional, monthly subscription, and per-click formats, as well as contingency-based or long-term contracts. We continue to streamline costs and have instituted cost improvement initiatives throughout the organization. We believe our recurring revenue will provide us with increasing flexibility to allocate and deploy our capital. 
 Growth Strategy

In addition, certain major software, hardware, information systems and business process outsourcing companies, both with and without healthcare companies as their partners, offer or have announced their intention to offer competitive products or services. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Substantially all of our business is directly or indirectly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by changes in the healthcare industry, including regulatory changes and fluctuations in healthcare spending. In the U.S. and other countries, the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Although some regulatory requirements do not directly apply to our operations, these requirements affect the business of our payer and provider customers and the demand for our solutions. We also may be impacted by non-healthcare laws, requirements and industry standards. For example, banking and financial services industry regulations and privacy and data security regulations may impact our operations as a result of the electronic payment and remittance services we offer directly or through third-party vendors. 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. 
 
17 


  In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate, and in some instances also through private civil litigation. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to compliance with federal, state and other laws and regulations and other requirements, see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Government Regulation and other Legal RisksRecent and future developments in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, Risk FactorsRisks Related Government Regulation and other Legal Risks Government regulation, industry standards and other requirements create risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies, and Risk FactorsRisks Related to Government Regulation and other Legal Risks We are unable to predict what changes to laws, regulations and other requirements, including related contractual obligations, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance. 
 Examples of the most significant of these laws include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements 
 There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (known as protected health information) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. The privacy regulations established under HIPAA also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. As a provider of services to entities subject to HIPAA, we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a Business Associate. We are also directly subject to the HIPAA privacy and security regulations as a Covered Entity with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse and with respect to our clinical care visit services. 
 When acting as a Business Associate under HIPAA, to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and contracts and associated Business Associate Agreements with our customers, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. To the extent we are permitted to de-identify protected health information and use de-identified information for our purposes, determining whether such protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. 
 Other Privacy and Security Requirements 
 In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information. Certain federal and state laws protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive. For example, the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records (42 C.F.R. Part 2) is a federal law that protects information that would reveal if an individual has or had a substance abuse disorder. Similarly, New Yorks Public Health Law, Article 27-F protects information that could reveal confidential HIV-related information about an individual. Some states have enacted or are considering new laws and regulations that would further protect this information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which builds upon and is more stringent in many respects than other state laws currently in effect in the U.S. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and 
 
18 


  other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of personal and other information to individuals or entities located outside of the U.S. The U.S. Congress is also currently considering a generally applicable national privacy law that may supplant Californias and other states privacy laws. 
 There also are numerous international privacy and security laws that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access, retention, protection, transfer and confidentiality of personal information. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, is more stringent than laws and regulations governing personal information in the U.S. Certain of our solutions involve the transmission and storage of customer data in various jurisdictions, which subjects the operation of that service to privacy or data protection laws and regulations in those jurisdictions. 
 Data Protection and Breaches 
 Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the states attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on both Covered Entities and Business Associates. In certain circumstances involving large breaches, requirements may even involve notification to the media. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Covered Entity or Business Associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA. 
 Further, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prosecuted certain data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, by regulation, the FTC requires creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. Although Congress passed legislation that restricts the definition of creditor and exempts many healthcare providers from complying with this identity theft prevention rule, we may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule. 
 HIPAA Transaction and Identifier Standards 
 HIPAA and our implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. HHS has established standards that health plans must use for electronic fund transfers with providers, has established operating rules for certain transactions, and is in the process of establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of the remaining types of covered transactions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) also requires HHS to establish standards for health claims attachment transactions. HHS has modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010. Further, as of 2015, HHS requires the use of updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures. Enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS. 
 Anti-Kickback Laws and Anti-Referral Laws 
 A number of federal and state laws govern patient referrals, financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and inducements to providers and patients, including restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS). The AKS prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, anything of value with the 
 
19 


  intent of generating referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Courts have interpreted the law to provide that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. Violation of the AKS is a felony, and penalties for AKS violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil penalties with treble damages (when the federal False Claims Act (FCA) is implicated) and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The ACA broadened the reach of the AKS by amending the intent requirement, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, as further discussed below, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim which includes items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, as well as restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMP). The AKS contains a limited number of exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of HHS has created regulatory safe harbors to the AKS. Activities that comply with a safe harbor are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not automatically render an arrangement illegal under the AKS. The arrangement, however, does risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, based on our particular facts and circumstances. Our contracts and other arrangements may not meet an exception or a safe harbor. Additionally, many states have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal or state healthcare program. In addition, federal laws restricting certain physician self-referrals (also known as the Stark Law), as well as state counterparts, may prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with physicians or other healthcare providers. The Stark Law is very complex, and state anti-referral laws vary widely. As noted below, to the extent we undertake billing and coding for designated health services, such activities may be subject to the Stark Law. 
 False or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding 
 Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance. We provide billing and coding services, claims processing and other solutions to providers that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of health services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal and state healthcare programs and private payers. In addition, as part of our data transmission and claims submission services, we may employ certain edits, using logic, mapping and defaults, when submitting claims to third-party payers. Such edits are utilized when the information received from providers is insufficient to complete individual data elements requested by payers. We also provide solutions including risk analytics, chart reviews, clinical care visits, payment accuracy, audit functions and enrollment and eligibility, to Medicaid and Medicare managed care plans, commercial plans and other entities. These solutions, which include identifying diagnosis codes with respect to hierarchical condition categories, impact the amounts paid by Medicare and Medicaid to managed care plans. In addition, some solutions we offer to customers enable customers to certify to compliance with certain requirements and standards, such as EHR Meaningful Use requirements. We rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use analytics, codes, reports and other information in connection with the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so. As a result of these aspects of our business, we may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the FCA, the CMP, and state equivalents. 
 In addition, the FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FCA also contains qui tam, or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. 
 
20 


 Exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs 
 We are also subject to the exclusion rules of the OIG whereby individuals and entities convicted of program-related crimes are excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A company that employs or contracts with an OIG-excluded individual and submits a claim for reimbursement to a federal healthcare program, or causes such a claim to be submitted, may itself be excluded or may be subject to significant penalties under the CMP, plus treble damages, for each item or service furnished during the period in which the individual or entity was excluded. A company contracting with providers has an affirmative duty to check the exclusion status of individuals and entities prior to entering into employment or contractual relationships and periodically re-check thereafter, or run the risk of liability under the CMP. 
 FDA and International Regulation of Medical Software 
 Certain of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. In the U.S., the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application, unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. Moreover, the FDA has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the FDCA. For example, in February 2015, the FDA issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. The Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, builds on the FDAs efforts to limit the regulation of low-risk medical devices by exempting certain categories of software functions from the definition of medical device under the FDCA, including software functions intended for administrative support of a healthcare facility and certain functions related to the exchange and use of electronic medical records. However, a software function may not be excluded from the device definition if the FDA determines that use of the software function would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences. 
 Foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, where we sell our medical device solutions internationally, we are subject to international regulation regarding these medical device solutions. For example, in May 2017, the European Union (EU) Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) (Regulation 2017/745) was adopted and in May 2020 the MDR came into effect. The MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, the MDR is directly applicable in the EU Member States and on the basis of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement in Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR, among other things: 
 

 | Strengthens the clinical data requirements related to medical devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Imposes additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure for high risk medical devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Imposes on manufacturers and authorized representatives the obligation to have a person responsible for regulatory compliance continuously at their disposal;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Requires that authorized representatives be held legally responsible and liable for defective products placed on the EEA market jointly with the device manufacturers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reinforces post market surveillance requirements applicable to CE marked medical devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a Unique Device Identification System; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
21 


 
 | Increases transparency. Information from several databases concerning economic operators, CE Certificates of Conformity, conformity assessment, clinical investigations, the Unique Device Identification system, adverse event reporting and market surveillance will be available to the public.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interoperability Requirements 
 There is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare IT products provided by various vendors be compatible with each other and allow for the efficient exchange of EHR information. In 2013, in order to address this demand for interoperability, a number of other healthcare IT companies co-founded the CommonWell Health Alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among physicians, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could eventually become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. For example, under the Cures Act, the ONC within HHS is required to develop a trusted exchange framework and common agreement for the secure exchange of health information between networks. Although the Cures Act does not make implementation of the trusted exchange framework mandatory, the Cures Act encourages its adoption through the establishment of a publicly available directory of networks that are capable of trusted exchange and by permitting federal agencies to require implementation of the trusted exchange framework by network contractors as the contractors update their health IT or operational practices. 
 The Cures Act also encourages interoperability through changes to EHR certification standards implemented as part of HHSs programs to promote interoperability. In particular, the amended EHR certification standards will require developers (i) to publish application programming interfaces that permit exchange of EHR and other health information among different health IT systems, (ii) to successfully test the real world use of interoperability technology, and (iii) to attest that they will not engage in information blocking or otherwise inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health information. 
 Restrictions on Communications 
 Communications with our customers and our customers patients are subject to laws and regulations governing communications, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and data privacy rules under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as well as potentially under non-U.S. laws that regulate communications and messaging and that affect our operations, such as Canadas Anti-Spam Law (CASL), GDPR, and the EUs e-Privacy Directive and implementing member state laws. We also use email and social medial platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain social media accounts and may occasionally email customers offers and promotions. As laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, we will become subject to such laws and regulations. 
Financial Services Related Laws, Regulations and Industry Standards 
 Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards. These laws may subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of our communication and payment solutions. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. We rely on relationships with such banks, vendors and providers. If we fail to maintain these relationships or if we maintain them under new terms that are less favorable to us, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer. The various payment modalities that we offer our customers directly and through banks, vendors, or other regulated providers may be deemed regulated activity at the federal or state level, and, as a result, we may be affected by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations and standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, reporting and disclosure obligations and requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information. In addition, our communication and payment solutions may be affected by payment card industry operating rules and security standards, certification requirements, state prompt 
 
22 


  payment laws and other rules governing electronic funds transfers. Moreover, in addition to regulatory requirements related to electronic funds transfers, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association, and these rules may affect our payment practices. Certain payment transactions may be subject to card association and network rules and standards. Finally, as we expand our financial services offerings we may be subject to additional laws and regulations, including certain consumer protection laws such as the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and various other state laws implicated by such financial services. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Bribery Laws 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar international bribery laws make it unlawful for entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining and maintaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business, to any person. In addition to the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, the statute also contains accounting requirements designed to operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions. Covered companies are required to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010 (Sunshine Act) requires manufacturers of medical devices covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Childrens Health Insurance Program to collect and track all financial relationships with certain healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and to report annually such data to CMS. Medical device manufacturers must report to CMS payments or transfers of value made to specified healthcare providers, including meals, travel reimbursement, consulting fees and research payments. The Sunshine Act authorizes significant civil monetary penalties for each payment or transfer of value not accurately or completely reported. In addition, several states and the District of Columbia have passed laws requiring that medical device manufacturers report various details of their financial relationships with specified healthcare providers. Some states prohibit or otherwise limit transfers of value to specified healthcare providers. Violation of these state statues could subject us to fines for each occurrence. 
Payment Card Industry Standards 
 We accept credit card, eCheck, ACH Payments, and payments via online portal, phone/Interactive Voice Response system or by mail. We also enable payers to collect member premium payments. These transactions are regulated at the federal, state and international levels as well as by certain industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, the National Automated Clearing House Association and individual credit card issuers. Federal, state, international and industry groups also may consider and implement from time to time new privacy and security requirements that apply to our business. Compliance with contractual obligations and evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent ACH, credit card and debit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher ACH, credit card and debit card related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of our ability to process payments through ACH transactions or on any major credit or debit card would adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
 
23 


 Other State Healthcare Laws 
 Many states in which we provide clinical care in-home assessment services prohibit corporations and other non-licensed entities from practicing medicine, nursing and other licensed professions by employing physicians and certain non-physician practitioners. These prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine, nursing and other licensed professions impact how we structure our relationships with physicians and other affected non-physician practitioners. In addition, some states have restrictions on physicians and other healthcare practitioners splitting fees with non-practitioners or restrict the ability of practitioners to assign claims for reimbursement from government healthcare programs. Some states have interpreted these laws to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges. Furthermore, we hold certain state licenses and enrollments in government healthcare programs which subject us to additional requirements and scrutiny by government regulators. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures designed to protect the intellectual property and commercially valuable confidential information and data used in our business. We generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers. This also seeks to control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 We use numerous trademarks, trade names and service marks for our solutions and have a number of patents and patent applications covering solutions we provide, including software applications. However, we do not believe our solutions are dependent upon any one patent or patent application, or family or families of the same. We also license from third parties a variety of content, data and other intellectual property. Although we believe that alternative technologies and work-arounds are likely to be available should these agreements terminate or expire, there is no guarantee that third-party technologies will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or that work-arounds would be readily available for deployment on a commercially reasonable time-frame. 
 The steps we have taken to protect our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and adversely affect our competitive position or results of operations. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 15,000 employees. Our board of directors oversees and receives regular updates on topics related to human capital management and corporate culture, including retention, employee engagement, workforce health and safety and privacy and information security. We aim to attract, develop and retain our team members using the human capital management and corporate culture practices summarized below. 
Learning and Development 
 We invest in our employees success through Change Healthcare University and our Career Development Center. These programs help our employees expand their knowledge and gain foundational understanding to support their growth and development. 
Diversity & Inclusion 
 We aim to create a diverse workforce, develop a culturally competent organization and build an inclusive culture. To support these goals, we prioritize diversity and inclusion training for our employees, including

  Unconscious Bias Training, and we track our progress with our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. Additionally, we support Business Resource Groups that represent a wide range of professional, cultural and personal affinities and interests. Each group is supported by a senior leader and provides our team members with an opportunity to connect and network. 
 Total Rewards, Health and Wellness and Community 
 We provide competitive salary, annual incentive awards, benefits programs, health and wellness benefits, stress and financial management resources, work/life balance resources, mental health resources and Teladoc Health access. To support our communities, our employees volunteered over 30,000 hours in the U.S. and Canada in fiscal year 2020. We provide paid volunteer days and, in the last year, we introduced an employee matching gifts program. 
Seasonality 
 The nature of our customers end-market results in moderate seasonality reflected in revenue differences during the year with a slightly greater positive variance in our fiscal fourth quarter related to the regulatory impact of data submission deadlines due to HEDIS, which may drive timing of analytics activity. Quarter to quarter financial performance may vary from historical seasonal trends as we further expand and diversify our business and increase the portion of our revenue generated from new offerings.
