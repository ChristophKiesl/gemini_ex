The company was previously engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. On April 29th, 2014, the company began a new direction and the majority of the Shareholders of the company elected the current Board of Directors and renamed the Company Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Directors formed a US based company founded in 2012 by a group of renowned researchers from the fields of molecular biology, cancer research and pharmacology. R&D is conducted in Government licensed labs in Israel with the focus of development of novel and sophisticated cannabinoid based therapies, medications and administration routes for various diseases.
History
 
Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on September 15, 2004, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Thrust Energy Corp., for the purpose of acquiring undivided working interests in small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both producing and exploration projects throughout the United States and Canada.
 
On September 30, 2010, we increased our authorized capital to 900 million shares of common stock (par value $0.0001) and 100 million shares of preferred stock (par value $0.0001), and effected a 20-for-1 reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from 13,604,000 shares to 680,202 shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares.
 
Due to our inability to earn any meaningful revenue from oil and gas exploration, our management determined in April 2011 that we should change our business plan to include toll milling and refining.
 
On May 5th, 2011, we effected a change of name to American Mining Corp. by completing a short form merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On April 25th, 2014, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware Corporation, purchased 20,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, thus acquiring control of the company.
 
On April 29th, 2014, Mr. Andrew Grundman resigned his official position as Director of the Corporation. On April 29th, 2014, the shareholders of the Corporation voted Dr. Zohar Koren, Dr. Eyal Ballan and Itamar Borochov as the new Directors of the Company.
 
Dr. Zohar Koren resigned his official position as director of the corporation on January 2015.
 
On June 3rd, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-to-one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split was approved by FINRA on June 19th, 2014. The effect of the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 40,880,203 to 81,760,406. All common share and per common share data in these financial statements and related notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the stock split for all periods presented prior to June 3rd, 2014. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.
 
On June 19th, 2014, FINRA granted final approval of Change of Name & Ticker Symbol of the Corporation from American Mining Corporation to CANNABICS PHARMACEUTICALS INC., with the new Ticker Symbol of “CNBX”. Said approval was predicated upon Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s filing of Articles of Merger with American Mining Corporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 21st, 2014. Under the laws of the State of Nevada, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was merged with and into the Registrant, with the Registrant being the surviving entity. The Merger was completed under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 92A, as amended, and as such, does not require the approval of the stockholders of either the Registrant or Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Company Overview –
 
CANNABICS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. is based in Bethesda, Maryland, and is dedicated to the development and licensing of advanced and sophisticated cannabinoid-based treatments and therapies. The Company’s main focus is development and marketing of various new and innovative therapies and biotechnological tools aimed at providing relief from diverse ailments that respond to active ingredients sourced from the cannabis plant. These advanced tools include innovative delivery systems for cannabinoids, personalized medicine therapies and procedures based on cannabis originated compounds and bioinformatics tools.
 
The parent Company Cannabics Inc was founded by a group of Israeli researchers from the fields of cancer research, pharmacology and molecular biology. Its current flagship Intellectual Property is named “CANNABICS SR”, a proprietary formulation to create a long acting medical cannabis capsule that was shown in observational studies in Israel to provide 10-12 hours of beneficial therapeutic effects and indicated initially as a palliative care therapy for cancer patients. This proprietary delivery method enables a convenient once per day dosing regimen of medical cannabis to patients.
 
The Company has a dedicated team of scientists that are working constantly on creating new technologies of medical cannabis care for patients in diverse indications. The company’s Research is located in Israel which has allowed for the use of medical cannabis since the 1990s, and has a favorable regulatory attitude towards the conducting of Cannabis based clinical studies in Israeli hospitals – in contrast to the legal situation in the United States where clinical research on medical cannabis is still illegal. This structure is an extraordinary corporate advantage, and markedly separates the company from similarly minded companies.
 
The number of people licensed to receive medical cannabis treatment in Israel numbers around 20,000 - in comparison to over 1,000,000 in the whole of the United States. Therefore, while the Israeli market potential is regarded as limited, the ability to perform clinical studies and use the Israeli market as an “advanced medical Cannabis R&D lab” is proving to be highly advantageous.
 
Most importantly, while the U.S. FDA has yet to approve even basic private research relating to cannabis, the regulatory environment is quite different in Israel. Within the Israeli Ministry of Health, there is a stand-alone agency, the Israeli Medical Cannabis Agency, (IMCA), which on October 26th, 2014, granted Cannabics Pharmaceuticals an exclusive government License to launch their advanced scientific R&D program.
 
Through the large body of research that is conducted by its scientists and affiliated partners, the Company has been able to gain in-depth knowledge of the various therapeutic effects of diverse cannabis strains and identify patterns of cannabinoid ratios that are useful in treating various indications. The Company is currently in the midst of several collaborative programs with several leading academic research and medical centers in Israel in order to further establish the beneficial therapeutic effects of its proprietary Intellectual Property, and to refine its development of novel treatments for debilitating ailments.
 
CANNABICS SR technology
 
While the medicinal effects of certain cannabinoids are well known to physicians, it is common knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health, due to the formation of inhaled carcinogenic compounds in the combustion process and deposit of tar and other damaging residues in the lung tissue. Many physicians are perfectly aware of the beneficial therapeutic properties of medical cannabis, however they refrain from recommending or prescribing it to patients knowing that smoking the raw flowers is still the most common and available administration route. Suggesting smoking for a grandmother going through cancer treatment makes little sense. Hence the availability of an oral, standardized, reliable and clinically tested administration route of medical cannabis – no different from the administration route of most medications consumed by patients today - would dramatically improve the availability of medical cannabis therapy to patients in need.
 
Standardization and reproducibility
 
Most practicing physicians are aware of the increasing market availability of cannabis edible products such as cannabis cookies, chocolates and chewing gums. However, these products have so far totally failed in gaining credibility in the eyes of the medical community due to a severe lack in standardization and reproducibility. Laboratory tests of cannabinoid concentrations in currently available edible products have demonstrated severe variability in the potency of those products, due to non-uniformity of manufacturing procedures in the kitchens that produce them. In addition, the bioavailability levels (the amount of active ingredients that ultimately reach the blood stream after ingestion) of these products is also highly variable due to the lack of a standardized and efficient formulation. As a result, it is very common to either over-dose or under-dose when using such cannabis edibles as a therapeutic means, a fact which rightly prevents most physicians from recommending these medically un-tested products. Therefore, a substantial unmet need of the medical cannabis market is a standardized and reproducible product, which is based on a sophisticated and advanced formulation that provides a high and predictable bioavailability level of the cannabis active ingredients to patients.

Long lasting and stable effect profile
 
An additional substantial drawback of most currently available administration routes of medical cannabis is the short lasting effect profile that they offer, with a typical 3-4 hour effect for smoking, vaporizing and sublingual administration, and a typical 6-7 hour effect for unformulated edible products. As a result, the patient has to re-dose several times throughout the day, and suffers from inconsistent and rapidly variable levels of therapeutic effects. Many patients and physicians report that this is one of the main limitations to the efficacy of currently available medical cannabis therapies, and a major cause for a sub-optimal treatment. Therefore, a substantial unmet need in the medical cannabis field is a long acting product that will provide a steady state level of therapeutic effects for at least 10 hours, and can thus allow a whole day of beneficial response within the therapeutic window upon a once-per-day dosing regimen.
 
Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed its proprietary “CANNABICS SR” long acting formulation in order to address these specific unmet needs of medical cannabis needs described above. This sophisticated and advanced formulation is the core technology embedded in CANNABICS SR. Our technology allows for standardized and long acting medical cannabis dosage, designed for specific and various indications. The proprietary formulation ensures the patient experiences a constant, steady state level of beneficial effects within the therapeutic window for up to a 10 – 12 hour span. The unique long acting formulation allows for once-per-day dosing regimen that provides the desired therapeutic effects of medical cannabis throughout the day. Thus, our technology enables a safe, effective and reproducible administration method and fulfils the unmet needs of both patients and physicians.
 
The Cannabics SR technology perfectly solves one of the major concerns of medical cannabis patients, which is the initial high peak of active cannabinoids concentration in the plasma soon after administration. This high peak is a common feature of immediate release cannabis administration methods, and can cause undesirable side effects such as disorientation and dizziness. The unique pharmacokinetic profile of our technology helps to avoid this undesired result. The CANNABICS technology assumes only natural pure extracts of active cannabinoids from specifically selected strains of medical cannabis, that are carefully chosen to serve the unique needs of patients suffering from specific indications. There are no synthetic compounds involved. The CANNABICS technology is pre-designed to fit the currently existing medical cannabis regulations in Israel, Europe and certain US States which are licensed as a “Medical Marijuana Infused Products Manufacturer” (§12-43.3-404 CRS). The ingredients used in the proprietary CANNABICS SR formulation are all certified food grade ingredients (recognized by the FDA as “G.R.A.S.” – Generally Regarded as Safe) and the formulation is free of any artificial additives or chemical substances. Thus the CANNABICS SR technology is fully compliant with the current cannabis infused edible product regulatory definition, which is in fact very similar to a regular food supplement regulatory definition.
 
As a result, CANNABICS technology is exempt from long and arduous pharmaceutical development processes and does not require additional regulatory approval beyond the standard “Medical Marijuana Infused Products Manufacturer” license from a licensee (the “manufacturer”) in order to reach the market. This unique position distinguishes CANNABICS SR technology from other options currently available in the market. On the one hand, the technology proffers a fully standardized and reproducible product that has compliance for GMP manufacturing standards just as one would expect from any pharmaceutical product; and on the other hand it is pre-designed to allow for use of this technology without long, arduous and extremely expensive regulation processes that are typical in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
In order to establish the goal of true standardization and reproducibility and to indeed rank as one of the leading medical cannabis technologies in the market, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has achieved Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) capabilities. GMP regulations are designed to ensure that products are produced and controlled according to the highest industry quality standards. Adhering to these practices ranks Cannabics among a very limited number of medical cannabis technologies available in the market that are capable of being manufactured according to GMP standards. An additional goal of the company is to be one of the first and few companies in the world to commercialize its clinically tested cannabis-based technology. In furtherance of this goal, Cannabics Inc. has now undertaken a series of clinical studies in renowned medical centers in Israel where the R&D division is strategically located. Achievement of GMP manufacturing capabilities is an important pre-requisite for the initiation of these clinical studies. The efficacy and safety data collected in these formal clinical studies, together with the superior pharmacokinetic profile of the Cannabics SR formulation, will be the key advantage of Cannabics in the medical cannabis arena.
 
Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. has now initiated its technology through a strategic partner in the state of Colorado and EU markets under existing medical cannabis regulatory pathways, while simultaneously preparing to launch a series of formal clinical studies in order to establish the unique medical benefits of its technologies for patients suffering from various indications.

Within Israel, Europe and other territories outside the US, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. may employ a different business model through gaining adequate licenses under the appropriate regulations in each territory, all in full compliance with local rules and regulations in each country. Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. is purely a Bio-Technology Pharmaceutical company which licenses use of its Intellectual Property, it does not itself produce or provide any product in any location.
 
The Cannabis Cancer Market
 
According to a January, 2017, report by Grand View Research, Inc. a San Francisco-based market research and consulting company: “Medical Marijuana Market Analysis by Application and Segment Forecasts”, the global medical marijuana market size in 2015 was valued at $11.4 billion and the projected annual growth rate of 17 percent through 2025. According to this study cancer is the most rapidly increasing segment with cannabis application and has an annual growth of 18 percent expectancy through 2025. Contributing to this factor is the increasing number of states, districts, and territories in the US that are enacting laws to legalize medical marijuana which is supporting the patients demand for cancer treatment. The report indicated that marijuana has indicated cancer cell destroying capabilities. In the meantime, there is limited recorded success in the actual usage of cannabis in the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society has yet to take an official position on the use of cannabis for medical treatment although they do admit that there are indications of its efficiency in dealing with nausea and vomiting as side effects from chemotherapy.
 
Cannabis is yet to be approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the US for treatment of cancer which is what is holding back the growth of this segment, according to the Grand View Research report.
 
The growth in the number of cancer patients and increasing interest amongst physicians and researchers regarding the use of medical marijuana in cancer treatment are indicators that will lead to increased investment and applications in the medical cannabis market over the next decade. Cannabics Pharmaceuticals hopes to take advantage of these developments and trends to capitalize on our technology to bring forth cutting edge solutions for both research, diagnosis and drug efficacy data that will provide additional insight into personalized health care.
 
The Cancer Diagnosis Market
 
According to Grand View Research, Inc., the global cancer diagnostics market size was valued at USD 124.0 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at an annual rate of over 7%. This market is expected to reach USD 232.7 billion by 2025 according to Orbis Research.
 
The growth in cancer cases, growing demand for effective diagnostic tools that develop from rising awareness, government support and technological developments are driving the demand for this increase worldwide.
 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide which leads to efforts to develop accurate diagnostic tools and effective treatment solutions. Early monitoring and pre-detection are being focused on as this leads to improved success rate in treatment. This leads to public awareness and healthcare support programs that promote routine check-ups which enable diagnosing the disease before first symptoms may appear.
 
According to BCC Research, the global market for circulating tumor cell (CTC) technology reached nearly $2.8 billion in 2012 and $3.7 billion in 2013. This market is estimated to reach nearly $8.9 billion by 2018, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.9% for the five-year period, 2013 to 2018.
 
The major factors that affect the growth in this industry is due to increase advancements in biomedical imaging and bioengineering technology. Genomics development of methods that enhance detection, enumeration and analysis of CTC in patient samples will lead the estimated growth in the industry through to 2022.

The increasing adoption of personalized medicine and regular diagnostic tools creates the possibility of aggressively battling cancer in new and heretofore unthought of methods. This will create momentum and align interests to progress along these routes.
 
The growing demand for ongoing screening, diagnosis and monitoring throughout the different stages of the diseases development in order to assess the patient’s health will feed the growth of this sector in the coming years.
 
Company’s Perspective
 
Cannabics is a pioneer in the constellation of Cannabis Cancer and Diagnostics. Personalization of cannabinoid based treatments is the main scope of the company, addressing the rapidly growing unmet need of cancer patients who are prescribed with cannabis. The multifactorial benefits of cannabis create an arising need that may unravel a new attitude to cancer treatment. The palliative aspects of cannabis such as reducing pain and nausea, propel the market to create OTC and pharma grade cannabis products to cancer patients. With minor side effects and no toxicity, the only barrier to millions of cancer patients is worldwide regulation. Our vision is to harness the anti-tumor properties of cannabinoids administrated first as palliative treatment and tuned with a growing database to possibly serve as anti-cancer medicine itself. Creating the constellation of CTC HTS Genomic data ahead of any other competitor puts Cannabics in the forefront of treating cancer with cannabis and may serve a large portion of the cross-section of two markets – cannabis and cancer diagnostics. The still confining regulation creates an advantage for Cannabis which is licensed to do such research and clinical studies in Israel by the Israeli government.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Overview
 
Our vision is to reveal and personalize the potential of cannabis medicine to treat cancer itself, as well as side effects. We develop cancer diagnostics in conjunction with cannabinoid medicine, utilizing novel bio-technological tools, striving to prevent cancer onset in healthy adults and progression in patients.
 
We engage our research and development through our wholly owned Israeli subsidiary G.R.I.N Ultra. The company possesses a government License from the Health Ministry to perform research on cannabis, develop products and test them clinically. To date, we have been doing in-vitro studies and clinical studies cancer cell lines and cancer patients respectively.

Natural products have served as vital resources for cancer therapy (e.g.,Vinca alkaloids, paclitaxel, etc., which are used as conventional chemotherapeutic agents ) and are also sources for novel drugs. Natural products from plants therefore represent an excellent resource for targeted therapies, as phytochemicals and herbal mixtures act multi-specifically, i.e. they attack multiple targets at the same time. Furthermore, the problem of drug resistance may be approached by integrating phytochemicals and phyto-therapy into academic western medicine through derivation and integration of data and as adjunct to conventional treatments. The integration of phytochemicals and phyto-therapy into cancer medicine represents a valuable asset to chemically synthesized chemicals and therapeutic antibodies. Cannabinoids are very good candidates for this approach. Cannabinoids are a class of over 60 compounds derived from the plant cannabis sativa, as well as the synthetic or endogenous versions of these compounds. Cannabinoids show specific cytotoxicity against tumor cells, while protecting healthy tissue from apoptosis. These effects are exerted through cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in mammals and through non-receptor signaling pathways. Recent studies suggest that cannabinoids contribute to maintaining balance in cell proliferation and that targeting the endo-cannabinoid system can affect growth of several different types of cancer, including gliomas, breast, colon, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinoma
 
These dual anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of cannabinoids and associated signaling pathways have been investigated on a large panel of cancer cell lines. Cannabinoids also display potent anticancer activity against tumor xenografts, including tumors that express high resistance to standard chemotherapeutics. Several other studies have investigated the possible synergistic effects of cannabinoids with standard oncology therapies, and are based on the pre-clinically confirmed concept of "cannabinoid sensitizers”. Cannabinoids have shown to enhance the efficacy of classical cytotoxic drugs at least in glioblastoma. However, additional studies are required to analyze the efficacy of these drug combinations in other cancer types as well as to identify additional cannabinoid-based drug combinations that could be useful for the treatment of cancer

While many anecdotal reports by cancer patients using various formulations of Cannabinoids suggest significant efficacy, the lack of pure pharmacologically active compounds and legal restrictions have delayed the clinical research that will ultimately determine whether cannabinoids are effective in the treatment of cancer beyond their proven palliative effects. Thus, only few clinical trials have been conducted aiming to confirm the antineoplastic activity of cannabinoids. Further studies require extensive monitoring of the effects of cannabinoids alone or in combination with standard anticancer strategies. With such knowledge, cannabinoids could become a therapy of choice in contemporary oncology.
 
Furthermore, Additional basic research will help lead to the development of cannabinoid-based therapies for the treatment of aggressive cancers and will also bring us closer to understanding the novel CB1 and CB2 independent component of the cannabinoid system that controls cancer progression.
 
For example, date, there has only been one clinical trial looking at the anti-tumor activity of cannabinoids on terminal human patients harboring actively growing recurrent gliomas.
 
Additionally, there are various in vitro studies elucidating the potential mechanism of action of cannabinoids for urological cancers, along with population-based studies specific for testicular malignancies. However, until now, no clinical trials have been conducted for urological cancer patients (bladder, kidney, prostate and testicles).
 
In a third example a study demonstrated the bladder cancer cell lines are regulated by activation of CB receptors where CB1 receptor activation played a more prominent role in proliferation, while CB2 receptors were more effective in triggering the pro-inflammatory state. Further research and more studies are required to understand the expression of these receptors in different stages of bladder cancers and also the varying effect of endocannabinoid ligands on the different CB1 and CB2 receptors.
 
Cannabinoids could provide unquestionable advantages compared to other current anti-tumor therapies:
 
(1) Cannabinoids selectively affect tumor cells more than their non-transformed counterparts that might even be protected from cell death;
 
(2) Selective inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation would be effective in those tissues where endo-cannabinoid levels are pathologically altered, without any significant psychotropic or immunosuppressive activity;
 
(3) Cannabinoids could represent an efficacious therapy in COX-2-expressing tumors that have become resistant to induction of apoptosis: acting as COX-2-substrates with no effect on the protective properties of COX-2-derived products, they could offer some advantage with respect to the NSAID in order to enhance the sensibility to conventional anticancer therapies.
 
Personalized Medicine:
 
Despite significant progress in cancer diagnostics and development of novel therapeutic regimens, successful treatment of advanced forms of cancer is still a challenge and may require personalized therapeutic approaches.
 
Advances in understanding many of the fundamental mechanisms of cancer progression have led to the development of molecular targeted therapies. While molecular targeted therapeutics continue to improve the outcome for cancer patients, tumor heterogeneity among patients, as well as intra-tumor heterogeneity, limits the efficacy of these drugs to specific patient subtypes, as well as contributing to relapse. Furthermore, Intra-tumor heterogeneity is caused by genomic instability in cancer cells, resulting in the selection of resistant clones, thus limits efficiency of cancer treatment. Thus, there is a need for a more personalized approach toward drug development and diagnosis that considers the diversity of cancer patients, as well as the complex milieu of tumor cells within a single patient.
 
Personalized medicine refers to customization of treatment on the individual patient level, while Precision Medicine is a contemporary term that describes the utilization of molecular diagnostics to classify disease, and where possible, delivery of select treatment based on causal genetic variants. Current day molecular characterization of disease using next generation sequencing enables a sensitive and specific diagnosis established by genotype. Correlating essential genotype with disease-modifying genes, environmental influences, and individual polymorphisms may help explain variations in phenotype.

Precision cancer medicine relies on the possibility to match, in daily medical practice, detailed genomic profiles of a patient's disease with a portfolio of drugs targeted against tumor-specific alterations. Clinical blockade of oncogenes is effective but only transiently; an approach to monitor clonal evolution in patients and develop therapies that also evolve over time may result in improved therapeutic control and survival outcomes.
 
Drug Resistance:
 
Furthermore, a major issue in the treatment of patients suffering from cancer is the development of resistance to therapies. This ability of cancer to adapt to pharmacological pressures stems from the tumor heterogeneity. Tumor heterogeneity is the co-existence of cellular populations bearing different genetic or epigenetic alterations within the same lesion, or in different lesions of the same patient. Tumor evolution depicts changes in tumor heterogeneity along the temporal axis and describes the dynamics by which, under environmental pressure, sub-populations of cancer cells bearing selective advantages emerge instead of the others. This process appears to be particularly marked when cancer undergoes sudden selective pressures imposed by medical treatment.
 
A major issue with targeted treatment therefore, is also early identification of patients with primary or secondary drug resistance.
 
Detection of Primary Tumor: Contemporary cancer therapy refers to treatment based on genetic abnormalities found in a patient's tumor. However, this approach is faced with numerous challenges, including tumor heterogeneity and molecular evolution, insufficient tumor samples available along with genetic information linking to clinical outcomes, lack of therapeutic drugs containing pharmaco-genomic information, and technical limitations of rapid drug efficacy tests with insufficient quantities of primary cancer cells from patients.
 
Our Research and Development:
 
To address these problems and improve clinical outcomes Cannabics focuses on the development of diagnostics that monitor cancer progression and cannabinoid-cancer sensitivity tests to tailor treatment of cancer with cannabinoid medicine. Utilizing novel High-Throughput Screening (HTS) methods to perform studies on cancer cell lines and on circulating tumor cells (CTC) derived from cannabis medicated patients.
 
We aim to treat a wide scope of cancers both as the main treatment and as a conjugate to conventional chemotherapy. We believe a significant need remains for novel oral and natural drugs for patients who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies bear undesirable side effects. We are currently exploring several formulations containing active compounds from the cannabis plant, including the psychoactive cannabinoid -THC and non-psychoactive cannabinoids - CBD, CBDA, THCA, THVC, CBN, CBG, CBGA and CBC. We recognize the potential therapeutic applications of the synergistic effects of these active compounds thus building the methodology and procedures that decipher specific ratios of active compounds in regard to their antitumor activity. Following successful research and development, we intend to license cannabinoid-based products and treatments that will be standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate and efficient delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies.
 
HTS on Cancer Cell Lines.
 
We have successfully standardized the procedure of high through output screening (HTS) for the detection of correlations between cannabinoid ratios, dosages and anti-tumor activity using a growing library of human cancer cell lines and creating an enlarged variety of Cannabis-based compounds. We examine the biological activity of these compounds on tumor cell lines of distinct tissue lineage, creating invaluable therapeutic data. We then screen the most potent cannabinoid/natural extracts with/without the conjunction of standard chemotherapy.
 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs):
 
Identifying Circulating Tumor Cells can be regarded as a “Liquid Biopsy of Cancer” method. CTCs can be useful for screening cancer drugs as they may reflect the severity and heterogeneity of primary tumors. CTCs are present in the blood of many patients with solid tumors. Most of these cells, which are thought to be involved in metastasis, die in the circulation, presumably due to the loss of matrix-derived survival signals or circulatory shear stress. The clinical value of CTCs as a biomarker for early cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, stratification, and pharmacodynamics have been widely explored in recent years. However, the clinical utility of current CTC tests is limited mainly due to methodological constraints.

However, a full cancer genome and transcriptome is present in each individual CTC, therefore these cells represent an interesting source of tumor information where mutations and gene fusions can be found. Many studies have used enumeration of CTCs to predict recurrence or used cancer-derived biomarkers to follow therapy resistance.
 
CTC Testing and Cannabinoids
 
We are currently in the process of commercializing a diagnostic test which is based on liquid biopsies of patients suffering from epithelial cancers.
 
Two tests are available and complement each other:
 
1. Cell count - The test uses CTC technology that marks and counts cancer cells from the blood sample.
 
2. Cannabinoid Sensitivity test. – This test counts number of live and dead cancer cells after being exposed to cannabinoid compounds such as THC or CBD with multiple combinations of other cannabinoids.
 
The results enable doctors to make better informed decisions by providing personalized patient data as supporting evidence to available medical treatments.
 
Genomics:
 
We are currently engaged in adding Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to our lab which will enable us to search for tumor mutations that have emerged as potential predictive markers of targeted therapy outcome to better understand their real clinical utility in identifying subsets of patients most likely to benefit from the administration of cannabis therapy.
 
Unmet need: Personalized medicine holds great promise for cancer treatment, with the potential to address challenges associated with drug sensitivity, drug resistance and inter-patient variability. Therapy approaches have so far been based on the characterization for tumors mainly by means of in situ tissue analyses (depicting disease as the sum of molecular alterations of a particular lesion at a definite time point). Furthermore, tumor heterogeneity is likely to be underestimated and insufficiently captured with single tumor-biopsy analysis. Similarly, single biomarker-driven therapy may not be adequate, suggesting that targeting ubiquitous gene alterations may lead to better cancer control and patient outcomes.
 
However, despite the vast knowledge gathering regarding tumor dynamics and genomics, still there exists the problem of tumor heterogeneity, as mentioned before, tumor heterogeneity among patients, as well as intra-tumor heterogeneity, variability among patients, and along the course for disease progression, challenges chemotherapy due to genetically and phenotypically different cell subpopulations and usually leads to drug-resistance by refractory tumors.
 
Additionally, despite the solid scientific evidences that cannabinoids exhibit a remarkable anticancer activity in preclinical models of cancer, the use of cannabis-based medicines in the clinical practice is restricted to palliative uses in a few diseases. Preclinical data accumulated during the last decade has stimulated the interest in developing additional clinical studies aimed at investigating the potential therapeutic value of these compounds in different diseases and specifically their potential as anticancer agents, however the number of active clinical trials is still very low.
 
Furthermore, although cannabis extracts are purely natural, and ignoring current US regulatory procedures, there is no conclusive evidence to support patient claims for starting on cannabinoid monotherapy (or combined therapy) for anticancer benefit even when all other avenues for therapy have failed.
 
There is still a long felt unmet need to provide a validated system and method for selecting appropriate cannabis based therapy grounded in evidence based medicine, and this is exactly the core of where our company’s energies and focus lay.

The Palliative side of Cannabis:
 
Therapeutic Potential of Cannabinoid for CACS
 
Cannabis has long been suggested to stimulate appetite, decrease nausea and vomiting, and improve quality of life in cancer patients. Studies on the efficacy of cannabis for improving CACS and S-NIS have had mixed results. After trials showing improvement in weight gain among AIDS patients, cannabinoids were tested on cancer patients as well. In a controlled, random study comparing dronabinol to a placebo among cancer patients, dronabinol was associated with increased appetite in 38% vs 8% for placebo, and decreased nausea in 20% vs 7%, using acceptable measurement scales. Of the dronabinol patients, 22% gained ≥2 kg, compared with 10.5% of placebo recipients, but this datum did not reach significance, perhaps due to the advanced stage of cancer and the high mortality in both placebo and experimental group.
 
Another randomized study compared dronabinol to megestrol acetate or both treatments together. The research included 469 advanced cancer patients who had been suffering from a substantial appetite loss. A greater percentage of megestrol acetate-treated patients reported appetite improvement compared with dronabinol-treated patients, 75% vs 49% (p=0.0001). Combination treatment resulted in no significant differences compared with megestrol acetate alone. Another study, which included 243 patients, compared the administration of a combination of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol to tetrahydrocannabinol alone, compared to placebo. It should be noted that cannabinoid dosages in the study were low, even in comparison to other studies. No significant differences between the groups were seen regarding improvement in appetite or weight-gain. In these two studies, no substantial side effects of cannabis products were found compared to the other arms. This may be related to the dosages of the drugs given.
 
A more recent study demonstrated improved chemosensory perception, appetite, sleep, and macronutrient preference in advanced cancer patients. However, the study included less than 50 patients. This research showed improvement in taste and smell perception in patients receiving chemotherapy, as well as appetite and caloric intake in the arm that received dronabinol compared to placebo.
 
Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Cannabis
 
Over 50 compounds have been isolated from cannabis. Generally, cannabinoids refer to compounds that activate CB1 and CB2 or have structures similar to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC has been found to reduce inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Cannabidiol (CBD), the most abundant non-psychoactive cannabinoid, has also been studied for its anti-inflammatory properties. In synovial cells isolated from mice, CBD suppressed release of TNF-alpha. Cannaflavin A is 30x more potent than aspirin as an inhibitor of prostaglandin E2. There is some evidence that PGE2 is involved in cachexia, and the reduction of prostaglandin E2 via inhibition of COX-2 has been shown to improve lean muscle mass. Beta-caryophyllene and luteolin are two non-psychoactive, anti-inflammatory compounds found in cannabis and in other plants. Beta caryophyllene binds to CB2 and inhibits TNF alpha and IL-1b expression in human peripheral blood. Luteolin, a flavonoid found in celery and green pepper, has been found to suppress the production of TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6 when added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.
 
Clinical Study
 
Our current clinical study in Haifa, Israel, is led by Professor Gil Bar-Sela, the Deputy Director of the Division of Oncology at Rambam Health Care Campus, Head of the Palliative and Supportive Oncology Unit, and Head of the service for Melanoma and Sarcoma patients. The main purpose in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and CACS is to prolong life and to improve quality of life (QoL) as far as possible. QoL in patients with CACS is directly related to loss of appetite and loss of weight.
 
The science:
 
Cachexia
 
Cachexia originates from Greek and Latin roots - Kakos- (bad) and - hexis (condition or appearance). It is associated with several chronic diseases and, generally, involves a dual mechanism of general muscle wasting, malnutrition, and anorexia. Cachexia is primarily caused by cytokines released from inflammatory cells. In 2011, an international panel defined cachexia as a “multifactorial syndrome characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment”.

Cachexia may be masked by excess weight, obesity, edema or tumor mass. Muscle wasting or sarcopenia occurs as a key feature of cachexia. In cachexia, muscle wasting is primarily caused by inflammation, in contrast to sarcopenia where muscle wasting is related to age and immobility. Additional parameters utilized to diagnose cachexia include food intake, CRP, and albumin levels.
 
Anorexia and Cachexia
 
Anorexia is a subjective term describing the reduction or loss of appetite. Although it is commonly known that patients suffering from cancer and cancer treatments experience loss of appetite, the exact prevalence of anorexia is unknown. In one study on advanced cancer patients, more than half the patients experienced anorexia.
 
In patients suffering from cancer, anorexia may be due to physiological and psychological factors. Anorexia can occur due to chemotherapy treatments, which cause nausea and vomiting. Tumors may also obstruct the upper gastrointestinal system, causing dysphagia and making it difficult to consume food. Depression also significantly contributes to decreased appetite. The decreased appetite causes increased psychological distress and a decreased quality of life.
 
The presence of a decreased appetite has been proposed to be an independent risk factor for mortality. A North Central Cancer Treatment Group study of 1,115 patients with colorectal and lung cancer found that patients with anorexia had lower survival rates and experienced more toxicity from chemotherapy than similarly matched patients who maintained their appetite. In a retrospective review of 3,047 patients by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology group, weight-loss greater than 5% before chemotherapy predicated early mortality regardless of stage or tumor type.
 
Cancer-Related Cachexia and Anorexia Syndrome
 
Cachexia may occur with or without a loss of appetite or reduction in nutrition. Interestingly, anorexia or decreased appetite is an independent risk factor for patient decline and, therefore, it has been proposed to view anorexia accompanying cachexia as a separate syndrome. Cachexia primarily caused by anorexia or reduced intake has been defined as cancer-related cachexia and anorexia syndrome (CACS). CACS, unlike cachexia, includes weight-loss caused by muscle wasting, as well as lipolysis and decreased intake.
 
Pathogenesis of CACS
 
Anorexia is due to both catabolic drivers and inflammation associated with cancer, side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiation, as well as depression and other psychosocial effects. It has been proposed that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, may decrease leptin release by mimicking excessive negative feedback signaling from leptin. In addition, these cytokines also contribute to hyper-metabolism and increased resting energy expenditure, especially as patients near death.
 
The symptoms correlating with decreased appetite in cancer have been referred to as “secondary nutrition impact symptoms” (S-NIS), and include early satiety, constipation, nausea or vomiting, dysphagia and depression. Increasing protein and caloric intake, may increase body mass and prolong survival. In order to have this effect, it has been suggested that patients should increase caloric intake by 300-400kcal and protein intake by 50%. This was demonstrated in a study using parenteral nutrition, as meeting these goals may be difficult in patients experiencing S-NIS.
 
Decreased appetite may also lead to malnutrition. Although the relationship between malnutrition and cachexia is not well defined, it is proposed that a lack of certain nutrients further contributes to muscle catabolism, especially a deficiency of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, and choline. Treatments that address CACS should improve appetite in order to correct malnutrition associated with decreased protein and caloric intake.

Intellectual Property, Specifics.
 
On July 31, 2014, the Company filed an exclusive Patent Application with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), which covers the proprietary technology developed by its team of experts in the field of cannabinoid long acting lipid based formulations. This technology is the basis for the company’s “CANNABICS SR” technology, which is the basis of a standardized and long acting medical cannabis capsules, designed for patients suffering from diverse indications. Simultaneously a Patent Application was filed with the PCT division of the Israeli Patent Office (ILPO) in order to provide International IP protection.
 
On May 27th, 2015 the Company filed a Patent with the USPTO entitled “A Method of in Vitro High Throughput Screening of Cancer Biopsies with Cannabinoid Extracts”. In essence this patent takes the next step from the cancer cell knowledge already obtained from cell lines in the Technion Laboratory and extends it to a system of analyzing cancer cells taken from patient biopsies, and then testing them against a multitude of cannabinoid combinations for anti-tumor activity via the High Throughput Screening process. This patent formally begins the next phase of the Company, which is Personalized Medicine (PM). We have developed an automated high-throughput method for the screening of different types of cancer cells or biopsies treated with a multitude of cannabis extracts. These natural extracts could also be tested in conjunction with already approved and common synthetic drugs for patients that undergo chemotherapy for the most personally tailored therapy. This multilayer method is producing a large-scale database that will capture the knowledge gained as to the unique effects of different combinations of cannabinoid compounds on diverse malignancies. Coextensive with the development of the automated high-throughput system, we are also developing proprietary and novel compounds targeting diverse and specific types of tumors.
 
On February 24, 2016, the Company filed a new patent application for the company’s slow release medical capsules with the US Patent & Trademark Office, as noted in their Press Release of that date.
 
On June 6th, 2016 the Company filed a PCT Application with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) entitled a "System and Method for High Throughput Screening of Cancer Cells". Cannabics Pharmaceuticals has developed a proprietary high throughput screening process which is designed to generate mega-data of specific cannabinoids and cannabinoid formulations with antitumor properties. In this proprietary process biopsies and live cancer cells lines are treated, In vitro, with innumerous combinations of cannabinoids and the resulting antitumor effects are screened, categorized and actually visually displayed.
 
On August 28th, 2017, the Company announced it received a very positive preliminary international patentability report from the PCT authorities regarding its patent application relating to personalized screening of necrotic cancer cells through a High Throughput Screening System (HTS), finding all claims “innovative and inventive”. This PCT report is significant as it secures the Company’s expanding proprietary IP rights.
Competitive Factors
 
The Pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with many other and better financed companies.
 
We are an early stage pharmaceutical company, with deminimis positive cash flow. We compete with other early stage bio-tech and pharmaceutical companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in early stage development companies. The presence of competing early stage pharmaceutical companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our research and development if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on their subjective analysis of our company, the general market conditions and the price of the investment offered to investors.
