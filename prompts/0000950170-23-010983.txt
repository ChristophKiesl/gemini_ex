Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company leveraging our innovative virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, with an initial focus on life-threatening respiratory diseases. Our VLP platform technology is designed to enable multivalent, particle-based display of complex viral antigens, which we believe will induce broad, robust, and durable protection against the specific viruses targeted. Our pipeline includes vaccine candidates targeting some of the most prevalent viral causes of pneumonia. We are developing these candidates for older adults, a patient population with high unmet need. Our lead vaccine candidate IVX-A12 is a bivalent candidate, or a mixture of two different VLP candidates. IVX-A12 combines IVX-121, a vaccine candidate designed to target respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and IVX-241, a vaccine candidate designed to target human metapneumovirus (hMPV). There are currently no vaccines approved that target both RSV and hMPV, which are two common causes of pneumonia in older adults. In September 2021, we began the clinical development of IVX-A12 by conducting a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of IVX-121 targeting RSV, and we reported positive interim topline and six-month durability data with respect to IVX-121 in June 2022 and December 2022, respectively. As planned, we then transitioned development to our IVX-A12 bivalent RSV/hMPV candidate. In October 2022, we received allowance for our investigational new drug application (IND) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12, with topline interim data expected in the second quarter of 2023. In February 2023, we announced that the FDA granted IVX-A12 fast track designation for the prevention of disease caused by RSV and hMPV in older adults aged 60 or older.
 We are developing additional vaccine candidates as part of our strategy to develop combination VLP vaccines targeting the viral causes of pneumonia in older adults, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In the future we may also develop candidates in other areas of unmet need where VLP vaccines have the potential to offer differentiated benefits.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to utilize our VLP platform technology to develop vaccines against infectious diseases with an initial focus on life-threatening respiratory diseases and a vision of creating pan-respiratory vaccines for older adults. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advancing our combination RSV-hMPV VLP vaccine candidate, IVX-A12, through clinical development and regulatory approval for the prevention of respiratory disease including pneumonia in older adults. Following positive interim topline and six-month durability data for IVX-121 in RSV, we initiated a Phase 1 trial for IVX-A12. We expect topline interim data for this trial in the second quarter of 2023 and, assuming positive results, plan to thereafter initiate a Phase 2 trial of IVX-A12. While monovalent RSV vaccines may soon be approved by the FDA, there is no approved vaccine for hMPV, and we believe that our bivalent RSV- and hMPV-targeted VLP vaccine is differentiated by targeting two leading causes of pneumonia in one vaccine, as well as other potential benefits.
•Leveraging our VLP platform technology to pursue additional vaccine candidates and combinations in indications with high unmet need. We believe our VLP vaccine technology has broad potential applicability beyond RSV and hMPV, including in influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and we have programs in both of these indications. We plan to evaluate the development of VLP candidates for other indications with high unmet need and where VLP vaccines have the potential to offer differentiated benefits. We also plan to continue to evaluate the potential of our VLP platform technology in combination vaccines in support of our vision to ultimately create pan-respiratory vaccines.
•Building manufacturing scale-up capability early in the development process. For all our vaccine candidates, we plan to identify and contract with large-scale commercial contract development and manufacturing organizations early in the development process. Our strategy is to initiate scale-up of manufacturing process development activities immediately following commencement of clinical trials to enable incorporation of manufacturing process changes early in development. We believe that this will lower manufacturing risk for our programs as well as accelerate our timelines to regulatory approval.
•Further optimizing our VLP platform technology and enhancing our antigen design capability. We intend to invest in process enhancements that we believe could enable more rapid development of future vaccine candidates. As part of this plan, we intend to evaluate alternative manufacturing processes that we 
 

believe could reduce time from candidate selection to availability of clinical trial material and enable us to rapidly respond to annual strain changes as needed in our influenza program. We have also added a research team deploying cutting edge antigen design and VLP scaffold design in the development of our pipeline programs.
•Maximizing the value of our vaccine candidates through selective partnerships. As we continue to build and advance our vaccine candidate pipeline, we may explore on a candidate-by-candidate or regional-basis partnerships or strategic collaborations to accelerate development or commercialization with third parties who have complementary capabilities that allow us to enhance the value of our pipeline.
Our VLP Technology
 Our technology platform is based on the VLP approach to vaccine development, which we believe has been validated through the regulatory approvals and commercial success of third-party, naturally occurring VLP vaccines and has several benefits. These naturally occurring VLPs have shown the ability to induce high and sustained levels (titers) of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in both older and younger adults, which have generally been associated with protective immunity. In addition, we believe VLPs can be used in combination vaccines as VLPs enable multivalent display of antigens in a manner that closely resembles viruses but contain no genetic material. However, VLPs engineered to display complex viral antigens have in general been difficult to develop or successfully manufacture at scale, limiting the pathogens that can be addressed by this approach.
 Our vaccine technology was licensed from the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington (UW) and is designed to enable the application of VLP-based vaccines against a broader array of pathogens than has been possible with naturally occurring VLPs and to overcome the manufacturing challenges experienced with these VLPs as well as some additional VLP technologies. Our licensed VLP technology utilizes a computationally designed protein structure that self-assembles without interfering with the structure of the displayed antigens. The individual protein components are expressed and purified using traditional recombinant protein techniques, which we believe will allow us to manufacture our VLP vaccine candidates efficiently at scale.
Vaccines are designed to prevent disease by providing a safe exposure to key components of pathogens capable of inducing protective immunity. Infants and young children have typically not been exposed to many pathogens and have limited immunity following the disappearance of maternal antibodies. As infants grow into adults the immune system becomes stronger and more capable of fighting off several pathogens that cause disease, owing to both vaccines and natural exposure to infections as children. However, as adults age, their immune system becomes weaker and less capable of mounting an effective immune response. This phenomenon is called immunosenescence, and it leaves older adults more susceptible to disease than younger adults. Recently, several vaccines have been approved or recommended specifically for use in older adults and we believe that novel approaches to vaccine development will continue to drive the market for prevention of disease in this population.
 

Our initial focus is on the development of vaccines to prevent respiratory disease including pneumonia caused by viral pathogens in older adults. We believe there is a need for effective vaccines to combat infections in older adults, who


are generally less able to mount an immune response against pathogens compared to other age groups due to immunosenescence. Immunosenescence causes older adults to be more susceptible to severe symptoms and death from infections and results in a weaker response to vaccination with conventional vaccines. For many infectious diseases, including RSV, hMPV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2, there is a strong correlation between nAb levels and increased protection against disease. For this reason, vaccines able to induce the highest and most durable nAb titers will likely be the most protective against infection, particularly in older adults. We believe that VLP vaccines may be effective in generating the high and durable nAb responses needed. In addition, we believe our platform has the potential to address the global need for thermostable, low-cost, and readily manufacturable vaccines.
 Benefit of Combination Vaccines
 We plan to utilize our innovative VLP platform technology to develop and deliver combination vaccine products, initially targeting respiratory pathogens in older adults. Combination vaccines have had commercial success in both pediatric and young adult populations with significant patient access and market penetration. This is because combination vaccines can be developed to protect against diverse pathogens or multiple strains or variants of the same pathogen with a single product while having the potential to reduce the number of injections and simplifying the immunization schedule.
We predict that as more vaccines targeting the older adult community are developed, combination vaccines will become the preferred approach for older adults, similar to what has occurred with pediatric and young adult vaccines. We believe an early focus on combination vaccine candidates against respiratory viruses in older adults will give us a competitive advantage over monovalent vaccine candidates in development, and our ultimate vision is to develop pan-respiratory vaccines.
 Potential Benefits of VLP Vaccines
 There are a number of highly effective VLP vaccines on the market (e.g., for HPV and HBV) and vaccines in development (e.g., for norovirus) that are based on naturally occurring VLPs. In these instances, the vaccines contain proteins from the target pathogen that naturally self-assemble into VLPs and are capable of inducing a protective immune response. Data from third-party and our preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest that VLPs are capable of inducing a robust and durable immune response that in some cases was superior to soluble protein antigens alone.
The robust response to VLPs is believed to be due to their interaction with several aspects of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, which are responsible for driving immediate and lasting immune responses. The innate immune system involves a diverse set of cells, including dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and macrophages, all of which generate a rapid response to pathogens or other foreign bodies. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is specific to a pathogen or antigen and is triggered when antigen presenting cells (APCs) from the innate immune system activate and recruit cells from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells which can form immunologic memory and therefore be activated upon reintroduction of the initial antigen or pathogen.
As illustrated in the figure below, VLPs are believed to induce robust immune responses through (1) improved uptake and presentation of VLP-based antigens by APCs that “instruct” T cells on pathogenic threats, (2) efficient trafficking of VLPs to the lymph nodes, a critical site for adaptive immune responses, (3) enhanced cellular crosstalk between APCs, T cells and B cells and (4) the potential of multivalent, VLP-based antigens to effectively cross-link and stimulate antigen receptors on B cells, which mature into short-lived plasma cells, long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells following exposure to antigens. Compared to soluble antigens, the observed strength of B cell receptor cross-linking by multivalent, VLP-based vaccines are believed to increase the induction of long-lived plasma cells, which provide a durable antibody response. As an example, marketed HPV vaccines have demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity and efficacy for 9-10 years following vaccination while 80% people vaccinated with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) VLP vaccine showed protective titers at least 10 years after their primary immunization.
 



We believe there are several other potential advantages to VLP-based vaccines. VLPs are non-replicating and non-infectious, which we believe has the potential to make them safer to use in all populations. In addition, since they do not replicate, VLPs have the potential to stimulate immune responses even in the presence of pre-existing immunity (through either previous infection or vaccination), which has limited the utility of some viral vector-based vaccine platforms. VLPs have also been observed to induce robust nAb levels in older adults, despite immunosenescence. VLPs have also been effective in the development of combination vaccines. For example, the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines for use against HPV, among others, incorporate combinations of VLPs targeting different viral strains. For Gardasil, the initial formulation contained four VLPs, and serotype coverage was expanded through the inclusion of five additional HPV type VLPs in a second-generation product, showing the feasibility of expanding VLP formulations. Gardasil/Gardasil-9 generated $6.9 billion in 2022 worldwide sales. In addition, the Takeda/HilleVax norovirus VLP candidate, a combination of two VLPs targeting different norovirus genotypes, has successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials. Evaluation of nAb titers induced by this vaccine candidate showed no difference between the response seen in adults aged 22-48 and adults aged 60 and over. In 2022, we announced positive Phase 1b clinical data with respect to our IVX-121 VLP vaccine candidate, as described above and below, that indicated that IVX-121 was generally well-tolerated and generated a robust nAb response in both young and older adults that was sustained for at least 6 months after administration.
Limitations of Earlier VLP Technologies
 The major drawback of naturally occurring VLPs is that they often cannot be easily engineered to display complex antigen targets or manufactured at commercially relevant scale. Since very few pathogens have protective antigens that naturally form VLPs, where the manufactured proteins naturally fold into the shape of a multimeric particle, this limits the specific pathogens that can be targeted with this approach. Several developers have and are currently utilizing various other approaches to develop and manufacture VLP-based vaccines. One approach is to use proteins from viruses that naturally form VLPs (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus and HBV) as scaffolds for protective antigens that fail to form VLPs on their own. There are also naturally occurring proteins that self-assemble into particles (e.g., bacterial protein ferritin or lumazine synthase) that can be used as scaffolds for presenting heterologous antigens. The main limitation of the natural scaffold-based approaches is that the structure is fixed resulting in limitations on the size and nature of the antigens that can be incorporated into these particles, as well as the valency and geometry of the antigens presented. Another approach is to use an enveloped VLP that buds from the host cell and contains cellular lipids that make up the lipoprotein envelope. Although this allows for incorporation of complex heterologous antigens, enveloped VLPs can be challenging to purify, with concerns about viral contamination as well as host-cell proteins being carried through to the enveloped VLP, particularly when mammalian expression systems are used. In addition, enveloped VLPs have historically had poor yields, scalability, and stability challenges.
 Our Solution—Computationally Designed VLP Technology
 We believe that our computationally designed VLP platform technology, licensed from UW, retains the benefits of the naturally occurring VLPs while potentially overcoming the constraints and limitations seen in some other VLP


technologies to date. Our platform is based on technology developed by scientists at UW, who pioneered a computationally designed VLP system with potential to address a wide range of vaccine targets.
Our licensed VLP technology includes VLPs formed from one and two protein components that are separately produced using traditional recombinant protein manufacturing techniques. With respect to our two component VLP technology, the antigen-bearing Component A consists of a trimeric protein that is genetically fused to the target protein of interest and is produced in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. The trimeric Component A assembly domain is derived from a thermophilic bacterium and has shown stability at above 70 degrees Celsius, which we believe has the potential to confer stability to the assembled VLP. The second protein, Component B, is a pentameric protein that is produced by bacterial fermentation and assembles cooperatively with Component A to form the two component VLP.
We are focusing our current development efforts on a single two component VLP scaffold, which allows for the same Component B to be shared across multiple vaccine candidates featuring different antigens presented on Component A, as illustrated in the graphic below.
 

Component A and Component B are expressed and purified separately prior to assembly. Upon mixture, the two protein components self-assemble into an icosahedral VLP displaying multiple copies of a trimeric or monomeric antigen, such as the 20 copies of the trimeric RSV or hMPV antigens in IVX-121 or IVX-241, respectively. VLPs may also be assembled using multiple Component As incorporating the same antigen, or by mixing Component As incorporating more than one antigen as shown with the mosaic influenza particle in the graphic above.
 Using our VLP platform technology we engineer vaccine candidates comprised of self-assembling proteins that are designed to have the following potential benefits:
•Robust, durable, and broad immune responses. The icosahedral symmetry of our VLPs mimics viral geometry and is designed to allow for increased antigen density. In addition, we believe our VLPs are within the optimal size range (20-100 nm) that enables efficient trafficking to the lymph nodes as seen with natural VLPs. Both increased antigen density and lymph node trafficking are known to trigger robust B cell immune responses. We believe that preclinical data and initial clinical data support the potential of our platform to generate VLPs that provide one or more of the following benefits: high nAb levels, durable immunogenicity, cross-protection against related viral strains, and a favorable tolerability profile.


•Potential to display complex heterologous antigens. Our approach allows for the multivalent display of complex antigens that would not normally form into VLPs.
•Highly scalable manufacturing and ease of purification. Our technology facilitates the use of standard, scalable recombinant protein production methods for vaccine manufacturing and purification with well-established cell line and fermentation technologies.
•Increased antigen stability. Our VLPs are designed to confer increased stability to our vaccine candidates, which we believe will allow for improved storage and distribution.
Vaccine Market Overview
 The 2021 global vaccine market was estimated to be over $140 billion, including an estimated $100 billion for COVID-19, $8 billion for influenza, and $7 billion for pneumococcal. Although sales for COVID-19 vaccines are projected to decline over time, sales for other vaccines are expected to increase. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are each projected to reach $13 billion by 2030. Recombinant, conjugate and subunit vaccines, which include VLP-based vaccines, make up over 50% of the non-COVID vaccine market.
Respiratory disease, including pneumonia, was the leading cause of death and hospitalization from infections and the fourth highest cause of death globally prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and it is estimated that prior to COVID-19, lower respiratory infection (LRI) caused over one million deaths globally in people over the age of 70 every year. The world adult population over the age of 60 is expected to double by 2050, so prevention of respiratory disease in older adults is a growing commercial opportunity. Many of the viral causes of pneumonia have no approved vaccines, limited treatment options, and result in high morbidity and mortality in the older adult population.
Our Programs
 Our initial focus is on developing vaccine candidates for viral causes of pneumonia in older adults. The following chart summarizes our current programs.

 | We have worldwide nonexclusive rights with the exception of South Korea (which is not included in the licensed territory), which will convert to exclusive rights in North America and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025, with non-exclusivity maintained elsewhere.

 Our current development efforts are focused on addressing the unmet need for safe and effective vaccines against leading causes of LRIs, including pneumonia, in older adults. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, LRIs were the fourth


leading cause of death worldwide, with morbidity and mortality increasing with age and pre-existing conditions. LRIs caused by pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 typically lead to over one million deaths worldwide per year in people over 70 years of age and pneumonia is the most common LRI. Many of the viruses found to be associated with pneumonia and LRIs have no approved vaccines as of March 2023, including RSV and hMPV. While two RSV vaccines are likely to be approved by the FDA in 2023, there is no approved vaccine that targets hMPV or the combination of hMPV and RSV. Other viruses associated with pneumonia, such as influenza, have marketed vaccines but efficacy is often low and variable from year to year.
 We have developed each of our vaccine candidates using a robust selection process to identify what we believe is the best antigen. Our selection process includes screening for expression, protein conformation, stability, VLP assembly competence, and evaluation of immunogenicity in multiple animal models, including those that have been previously infected with the pathogen (i.e., primed) when relevant. We in-license antigens where we believe that others’ discoveries may be optimally suited for our technology. We also develop our own antigens in-house.
 IVX-A12 (RSV-hMPV vaccine candidate), a bivalent combination of IVX-121 (RSV vaccine candidate) and IVX-241 (hMPV vaccine candidate)
IVX-A12 is a bivalent combination of IVX-121, which is designed to target RSV, and IVX-241, which is designed to target hMPV. Both IVX-121 and IVX-241 have been designed to display prefusion stabilized F antigens of RSV and hMPV, respectively. The F (fusion) proteins of these viruses are critical for viral entry. F proteins are also one of the main targets for nAbs and are a focus of most vaccine efforts for respiratory viruses such as RSV and hMPV.
Although we believe the F protein of RSV was validated as a target in 1998 through Synagis, a monoclonal antibody used to protect high-risk infants from infection, it was only more recently that F antigen-based vaccines began to show proof of concept in clinical development. The conceptual breakthrough came in 2013 with the resolution of the crystal structure of the prefusion F antigen, its form before viral entry into a cell, and the recognition that there is a significant change and loss of critical protective epitopes in the molecule’s postfusion F form, its form following viral entry. The subsequent design of stabilized RSV F prefusion antigens reinvigorated the field, leading to substantially improved immune responses and protection. More recently, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Moderna reported positive Phase 3 efficacy studies of their RSV vaccines incorporating stabilized RSV F prefusion antigens. Preclinical work suggests a similar structural transition occurs to the hMPV F antigen following viral entry, and that the hMPV prefusion F antigen provides superior protection to the hMPV F postfusion antigen.
 We have licensed a prefusion stabilized form of the RSV F antigen, DS-Cav1, from the National Institute of Health (NIH) that has been demonstrated in clinical trials conducted by the NIH to be a robust immunogen. An initial clinical trial with DS-Cav1 showed an induction of nAb titers much higher than had previously been seen with other postfusion vaccine approaches to RSV. We have incorporated DS-Cav1 into our VLP candidate IVX-121. Preclinical data with hMPV antigens provide support for the F antigen as a potential target for protective immunity, and we have incorporated a prefusion F antigen into our VLP candidate IVX-241. The prefusion F antigen in IVX-241 incorporates key mutations that we have licensed from the NIH and the University of Texas at Austin (UT). We assessed different ratios of IVX-121 and IVX-241 in preclinical studies in an effort to identify the ratio least likely to induce immunologic interference between them prior to initiating clinical trials of IVX-A12, and we are currently evaluating ratios of IVX-121 to IVX-241 in our IVX-A12 clinical trial. We believe that multivalent display of these prefusion F antigens on the surface of our VLPs has the potential to induce a robust nAb response capable of conferring protection against infection of both viruses, which we are assessing in clinical trials.
We believe that a bivalent VLP vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV is an optimal approach to prevent these two common causes of pneumonia. We initiated clinical development of IVX-A12 with a clinical trial of IVX-121. We conducted a Phase 1/1b clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of IVX-121 in adults aged 18-45 and 60-75, and in June 2022, we announced positive topline interim results. These topline interim data showed that IVX-121 induced a robust immune response, consistent across both young and older adult groups, including at the lowest non-adjuvanted dose tested and was generally well-tolerated across all dosage groups. We received allowance to proceed from the FDA under our IND and in October 2022, we announced initiation of a Phase 1 IVX-A12 clinical trial, with topline interim data expected in the second quarter of 2023. In December 2022, we reported positive six-month IVX-121 immunogenicity data, demonstrating a sustained nAb response against RSV, lasting for at least six months after a single administration of IVX-121. We are also conducting a Phase 1b extension study for IVX-121, in which a subset of older adults from the Phase 1b cohort will be followed out to 12 months to assess durability of response, and response to an additional vaccine dose.


Twelve-month IVX-121 immunogenicity data is expected for this study in mid-2023. In February 2023, the FDA granted fast track designation to IVX-A12 for the prevention of disease caused by RSV and hMPV in older adults aged 60 or older.
 IVX-A12 Market Opportunity
Marketed vaccines for pneumococcus and influenza, two major causes of pneumonia, had an estimated combined annual 2021 global revenue of $15 billion. RSV and hMPV are also highly prevalent respiratory pathogens that occur seasonally. The largest epidemiological study assessing prevalence of RSV and hMPV that compared with influenza and pneumococcal in adults was the EPIC study published in 2015. Based on this study, the two most common pathogens causing pneumonia in adults after human rhinovirus, influenza pneumococcus and influenza were RSV and hMPV, which were found in 8% and 11%, respectively, of U.S. adults hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia where any pathogen was detected, as shown below.

 Pneumonia (EPIC Study*)

 Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines are important vaccines in the current respiratory vaccine market. Both are recommended for immunization by healthcare policy makers in the United States and other major markets. The global pneumococcal market was estimated to be around $7 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow to around $13 billion in 2030. The global influenza market size is estimated to be around $8 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow to around $13 billion by 2030. Older adults make up a significant proportion of these sales. Uptake of influenza vaccines in U.S. adults over the age of 65 increased from 70% in the 2019-2020 season to 74% in the 2021-2022 season. Pneumococcal vaccine uptake is also estimated to be around 70% in adults over 65 years of age. Pneumovax23, a pneumococcal vaccine with uptake primarily in the older adult population, had 2022 sales of $600 million. We believe that sales of vaccines for older adults will grow substantially in the future, as the world adult population over the age of 60 is expected to double by 2050.


RSV is estimated to cause 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults 65 years of age or older annually in the United States alone. Costs per hospitalization for RSV in older adults are estimated to be at least as great as those of influenza due to longer hospital stays and greater pulmonary complications. The U.S. economic burden for RSV-related hospitalizations alone is estimated to be greater than $2.5 billion per year. Rates of hospitalization and severity of disease for hMPV have been shown to be similar to those seen with RSV and influenza. There are currently no marketed vaccines that target both RSV and hMPV, two common causes of pneumonia.
In addition, recent data show that both morbidity and mortality in U.S. adults hospitalized with viral pneumonia is higher with both RSV (16.1% likelihood of ICU admission and 5.2% likelihood of death) and hMPV (16.5% likelihood of ICU admission and 3.9% likelihood of death) than with influenza (11.5% likelihood of ICU admission and 3.3% likelihood of death). Given these data, a combined RSV-hMPV vaccine could address a substantial unmet medical need.
We have conducted a primary and quantitative research campaign including interviews with 35 U.S. and EU payors and policy makers and a quantitative survey with 140 U.S. vaccinators (physicians and pharmacists). Data from the study suggest that once launched, an effective RSV vaccine targeting the older adult population could be included in policy (e.g., Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; ACIP) guidelines. This applied to both monovalent (RSV only) and combination vaccines that incorporate an RSV component. These guidelines drive recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and equivalent organizations outside the United States, and can lead to inclusion on payor formularies. Inclusion of GlaxoSmithKline and/or Pfizer RSV vaccines into older adult immunization guidelines in the United States could happen as early as 2023 based on the upcoming Prescription Drug User Fee Act dates and scheduled ACIP review for these vaccine candidates. The quantitative survey results suggested that policy recommendations were likely to drive immediate vaccine utilization of an RSV vaccine. Survey results also suggested that vaccinators were likely to have a strong (90%) preference for a combination RSV-hMPV vaccine over an RSV monovalent vaccine, assuming equivalent efficacy against RSV. Overall, we believe that the survey results supported continued development of a bivalent RSV/hMPV vaccine candidate. In February 2023, the FDA granted fast track designation to IVX-A12. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of, investigational drugs to treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need.
IVX-121—RSV VLP Vaccine Candidate
 Overview of RSV
 RSV is an RNA virus that replicates in the nose and lungs and is a major viral cause of LRI worldwide. There are two major subtypes of RSV, A and B, which may co-circulate in a single RSV season. Re-infection is common, and all older adults are expected to have been exposed to RSV and have RSV-specific antibodies. The most common symptoms are cough, fatigue, dyspnea, congestion, wheezing, and fever.
High Neutralizing Antibody Titers Correlate with Reduced Risk of Infection and Disease
 There is substantial data correlating high nAb titers with protection against RSV. Published preclinical data, natural history studies, human challenge studies, and clinical data all demonstrate reduced risk of infection and disease when higher nAb titers are present. Published natural history studies have demonstrated that once partial protection is achieved, every additional doubling in RSV nAb titer may be associated with an 22-25% decrease in RSV-associated hospitalization. Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Sanofi that followed 1,180 subjects aged 65 or older with cardiopulmonary disease over two years at U.S. sites provided additional support that increasing titers correlate with a reduced risk of respiratory illness. As illustrated in the figure below, a doubling of RSV nAb titer was observed to be correlated with a reduced risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Based on these and similar findings, we have designed IVX-121 to increase the magnitude, quality, and durability of the nAb response.

Prefusion RSV-F Protein-Based Vaccines May Generate Higher Neutralizing Antibody Titers than Postfusion Vaccines
 RSV contains several glycoproteins that are important for different functions of the virus, including the surface fusion protein F (RSV-F). RSV-F is a highly conserved glycoprotein that contains the majority of the neutralizing epitopes, specific regions of antigens that bind protective antibodies. We believe RSV-F was validated as a target for protection by the reported positive efficacy results from Phase 3 studies of multiple vaccine candidates, including from GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, and by the clinical efficacy and approval of Synagis, a monoclonal antibody used to protect against serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants at high risk of RSV disease. RSV-F is critical for fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane and the conformation of RSV-F changes significantly between the prefusion or postfusion state. nAbs that bind to prefusion F can block viral entry into cells, thereby reducing viral replication and the severity of RSV-related disease.
The RSV-F protein naturally shifts to the postfusion state and vaccine developers initially focused on vaccines containing the postfusion conformation. These vaccine candidates induced approximately two- to four-fold increases in nAb titers, which was not a sufficient increase in nAb titers to protect a large enough portion of the trial participants to justify continued development.
Data now show that the majority of the nAbs against RSV-F in human sera are directed against the prefusion conformation, and that prefusion directed antibodies have greater neutralizing activity than antibodies directed against the postfusion protein. Researchers at the NIH developed an antigen called DS-Cav1, a prefusion stabilized form of RSV-F that has elicited high titers of nAbs against RSV in mice and nonhuman primates. The NIH conducted an initial Phase 1 trial of DS-Cav1 that showed the antigen induced high nAb titers in humans, much higher than had been seen with postfusion F antigens tested by other developers, as further described below. Although DS-Cav1 provided proof-of-concept (PoC) for prefusion RSV F antigens, DS-Cav1 is not fully stabilized in the prefusion conformation and converts over time to a postfusion structure, which has limited its commercial viability.
We have in-licensed the prefusion RSV-F antigen DS-Cav1 and related technology from the NIH and have incorporated the DS-Cav1 antigen assessed in the NIH Phase 1 trial onto our VLP scaffold. IVX-121 has been designed to display 20 copies of DS-Cav1 as a novel two-component VLP, as shown on the right of the figure below.
 




We believe that multivalent, particle-based display of the DS-Cav1 antigen has the potential to improve antigen presentation and B cell receptor cross-linking as has been observed with other VLPs. In addition, we have observed that the fusion of DS-Cav1 to the assembly domain of Component A of the VLP further stabilizes the prefusion structure of RSV-F so that the prefusion conformation is maintained under normal storage conditions.
 IVX-121 Prefusion F Protein Stability
 In preclinical studies, we have observed that the fusion of DS-Cav1 to Component A further stabilized the prefusion conformation and the resultant assembled VLP was very stable at two to eight degrees Celsius, which is a typical temperature range for vaccine storage. In comparison, long-term storage of DS-Cav1 at four degrees Celsius resulted in a shift away from the prefusion stabilized structure as measured by reduction of prefusion specific antibody binding, including D25 binding, by 102 days.
IVX-121 Clinical Results
 Following preclinical studies, we advanced IVX-121 into the clinic in September 2021, and the results of our Phase 1/1b clinical study are described below.
 IVX-241 hMPV VLP Vaccine Candidate
 Overview of hMPV
 hMPV is an RNA virus that is related to the RSV virus. hMPV was first identified in 2001, though it was likely in circulation for at least 50 years prior to discovery. Infection with hMPV brings a similar symptomatic profile as RSV with the most common symptoms being cough, wheezing, dyspnea, congestion and fatigue. Similar to RSV, there are two genetic lineages of hMPV, hMPV/A and hMPV/B, which show a high degree of sequence homology and co-circulate with varying annual prevalence of each strain. The hMPV virus has several highly conserved viral proteins including a fusion protein (F). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that immunization with the F protein is capable of inducing nAbs and protecting against viral challenge in animal models. Vaccination with an F protein from one lineage has been shown to result in nAb titers capable of protection against both hMPV strains, though titers against the heterologous strain are often lower. Similar to RSV, the F protein of hMPV undergoes a conformational change from the prefusion to the postfusion structure to enable entry into the host cell. Recent data indicate that prefusion stabilization of the F protein results in an improved immunogenicity profile in mice, similar to results previously seen with RSV. Our development is focused on a pre-fusion stabilized hMPV antigen.
RSV, hMPV, and influenza seasons show high though not complete seasonal overlap, and hMPV is underdiagnosed and often mistaken for RSV or influenza given the similarity in clinical presentation. As diagnostic tools improve, hMPV is being increasingly recognized as a major contributor to ARI and LRI. Similar to RSV, prospective cohorts from third-party clinical trials have shown that higher baseline hMPV nAbs were associated with reduced risk of hMPV symptomatic virus infection, so the goal of vaccination is to increase hMPV nAbs. There are currently no FDA-approved antivirals or vaccines to treat or prevent hMPV.
hMPV Antigen Selection and Immunogenicity Results
 

Expression of the hMPV F protein has been shown to be challenging and efforts have been made to introduce modifications within the protein to improve expression and stabilize the prefusion structure. We evaluated a number of potential candidate antigens for compatibility with our two-component VLP platform and selected IVX-241. IVX-241 incorporates an F antigen from hMPV/A and was selected based on key criteria, including: high expression, prefusion conformation, monodispersity, VLP stability, and high nAb titers following VLP administration in rodent studies.
Activity of IVX-241 in BALB/c Mice
 In order to evaluate the longevity of the immune response induced by IVX-241, BALB/c mice were immunized twice at Day 1 and Day 21, and sera was collected over a 153-day period. Titers peaked at Day 35 and then stabilized, with titers of >9 log2 maintained out through Day 153. To explore the mechanism for the durability of the antibody response we quantified antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) in animals immunized with either soluble trimeric antigen or IVX-241 by ELISpot. The animals immunized with the multivalent VLP version of the hMPV F prefusion antigen showed significantly higher numbers of antigen-specific LLPCs.
 
Activity of IVX-A12 via Intramuscular Administration in Cotton Rat Model
 To evaluate the potential of IVX-121, IVX-241 or IVX-A12 formulated with Addavax (oil-in-water adjuvant) to protect in a live virus (RSV/A and hMPV/A) challenge model, cotton rats were administered two doses of IVX-121, IVX-241 or IVX-A12 (1 ug of each VLP) on day 0 and day 21 and subsequently challenged with RSV/A or hMPV/A two weeks post the second administration.
 Strong nAb titers against RSV and hMPV were observed in the animals two weeks post the second VLP administration and prior to challenge. Titers in monovalent and bivalent formulations were equivalent. The animals were challenged intranasally with 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of either RSV/A2 or hMPV/A and lung tissue samples tested 5 days post challenge for viral replication. Cotton rats that were not vaccinated but challenged with RSV or hMPV resulted in substantial viral titers in the lung. Monovalent or bivalent formulations blocked viral replication of each of RSV and hMPV to below the lower limit of quantitation.
 



We have advanced IVX-A12 into the clinic and we describe our clinical development plan below.
 IVX-A12 RSV-hMPV Combination Vaccine Candidate Clinical Development Plan
 We intend to pursue regulatory approval of our RSV/hMPV combination VLP candidate IVX-A12 in the older adult population. As is standard for vaccine development where correlates of protection have not been identified, we are first evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate in a Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) trial in healthy older


adults including measuring the change in RSV and hMPV nAb levels compared to baseline antibody levels. We are also assessing different combinations of RSV and hMPV for potential immune interference caused by the addition of hMPV VLPs to the RSV VLP vaccine candidate and to inform the ratio of each VLP in the combination vaccine candidate. Contingent upon favorable safety results, demonstration of immunogenicity and determination of our RSV-hMPV dose combination based on Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, we plan to assess the efficacy of our RSV-hMPV combination vaccine candidate. For example, the efficacy may be assessed by measuring incidence of LRI caused by either RSV or hMPV in patients receiving IVX-A12 compared to those receiving placebo, or a similar, alternative proof of concept for efficacy.
Based on the clinical and preclinical data for IVX-121, preclinical data for IVX-241, and different formulations of IVX-A12, we also plan to assess whether to advance an adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted formulation of IVX-A12 to later stages of development. Specifically, in our current Phase 1 trial of IVX-A12 we are evaluating varying doses of IVX-A12 with and without CSL Seqirus’ proprietary MF59® adjuvant.
 IVX-121 Phase 1/1b and IVX-121 Phase 1b Extension Trial
 Our plan for the clinical development of IVX-A12 has been to first assess safety and immunogenicity of the RSV monovalent VLP candidate IVX-121 in an initial Phase 1/1b trial in Belgium, for which we reported positive topline interim and six-month durability data in June 2022 and December 2022, respectively.
This FIH trial with IVX-121 was a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 1/1b trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of non-adjuvanted and Alhydrogel-adjuvanted IVX-121 in two adult cohorts: 18-45 years of age (Phase 1, n = 90) and 60-75 years of age (Phase 1b, n = 130). All subjects in the trial were evaluated for safety and persistence of antibody response for six months following a single intramuscular administration of either IVX-121 or placebo.
 In June 2022, we announced positive topline interim results from the Phase 1/1b trial. These topline interim data showed that IVX-121 was generally well-tolerated across all dosage groups and induced a robust immune response, consistent across both young and older adult groups, and including at the lowest non-adjuvanted dose tested. In December 2022, we reported positive six-month immunogenicity data, demonstrating a sustained nAb response against RSV in young and older adults, lasting for at least six months after a single administration of IVX-121. In these data, IVX-121 showed geometric mean titers (GMT) against RSV-A through day 180 persisting at 64-98% of the GMTs at day 28 in older adults. GMTs against RSV-B showed greater variability but were maintained above baseline through day 180.
 We are also conducting a Phase 1b extension study for IVX-121 in Belgium, in which a subset of older adults from the Phase 1b cohort will be followed out to 12 months to assess durability of response. We expect twelve-month immunogenicity data in mid-2023.
IVX-A12 Phase 1 Trial
 Following a pre-IND interaction with the FDA for the IVX-A12 combination bivalent RSV-hMPV VLP vaccine candidate in the fourth quarter of 2021, and IND allowance by the FDA, we announced the initiation of our Phase 1 trial for IVX-A12 in October 2022. We are evaluating the combination candidate IVX-A12 in this trial, with no evaluation of IVX-241 as a monovalent vaccine candidate.
The goal of the Phase 1 trial of IVX-A12 is to assess safety and immunogenicity of varying doses of IVX-A12, with and without CSL Seqirus’ proprietary MF59® adjuvant, in older adults 60-75 years of age (n = approximately 120). Dosing of subjects is now complete. In this Phase 1 trial, subjects were administered a single shot of IVX-A12 at one of three combination dosage levels, or placebo. We expect this design will enable evaluation of the immune responses to both individual components of IVX-A12 and whether the combination of VLPs increases the reactogenicity or leads to immune interference (i.e., imbalanced immune responses to component VLPs). Subjects in the Phase 1 trial are being evaluated for safety and antibody response for twelve months following administration of IVX-A12 or placebo. We expect initial interim immunogenicity data from this trial in the second quarter of 2023.
IVX-A12 Phase 2 Dose-Confirmation Trial
 

Following and subject to positive topline interim data from the IVX-A12 Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 dose-confirmation clinical trial in older adults over the age of 60. We plan to select the formulations and dose regimen for evaluation in the Phase 2 clinical trial based on data from the IVX-A12 Phase 1 trial. Our planned Phase 2 clinical trial is intended to guide final dose selection for a subsequent PoC efficacy trial.
 IVX-A12 PoC Trial
 Following the Phase 2 dose-confirmation trial, we subsequently plan to conduct a PoC efficacy trial of IVX-A12. Anticipated PoC objectives include assessment of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy against illness caused by either RSV or hMPV. Given recent data from Phase 3 trials of vaccines incorporating prefusion RSV antigens and our corporate strategy, we are continuing to evaluate and working to optimize our clinical development plans for IVX-A12.
 Influenza Program
 Overview of Influenza
 Influenza is caused by a respiratory viral pathogen that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. There are two main types of influenza viruses: types A and B. Viral nomenclature is based on two genes in the virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that are critical for viral entry and release from cells, as well as species specificity. There are multiple distinct versions of both HA and NA that are numbered to describe related sequences and result in the name of specific viruses. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics each year. Existing vaccines have sub-par efficacy (ranging from approximately 20% to 50% year to year) and need to be updated seasonally due to changes in the genetic sequences of the dominant viral variants that circulate in response to human immune pressure.
The reduced efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines is due in part to the fact that current vaccines are designed to target a narrow subset of predicted strains, and mispredictions about the dominant circulating strain are common as manufacturing must proceed based on data from the previous seasonal epidemic. Another cause of reduced efficacy is that influenza vaccines are often manufactured in chicken eggs, and egg-adapted mutations in protective antigens (i.e., HA) can occur during the manufacturing process that reduce the potency of those vaccines for the viruses that are circulating in humans. The low efficacy of current influenza vaccines leaves an unmet need for an influenza vaccine with improved efficacy. This is particularly needed in the older adult population, who are less likely than other age groups to respond to conventional vaccines. In seasonal influenza, vaccines have historically been up to approximately two times less effective in adults 65 and older compared to other adult age groups.

 * 2020-2021 influenza vaccine effectiveness was not estimated due to low influenza virus circulation during the 2020-2021 influenza season
 

Influenza results in an estimated 500,000 hospitalizations and 35,000 deaths per year in the United States despite numerous marketed vaccines. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths are in people over the age of 65. In the 2019-2020 influenza season, for example, 45% of the hospitalizations and 59% of the deaths were in people over the age of 65.
In addition to the recurring burden of disease of seasonal influenza, there are concerns about the potential for influenza pandemics, which occur when novel animal viruses jump the species barrier to humans as has occurred with SARS2. In 1917, the H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed between 50-100 million individuals. Improved vaccine technologies that can rapidly scale vaccine production and provide robust protection against future pandemics are also needed.
Data from a collaboration between the UW and National Institutes of Health provided initial PoC for improved responses to influenza vaccines based on the two-component VLP vaccine technology when compared to commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV). In preclinical studies in mice, ferrets and NHPs HA proteins from 4 influenza strains (either as a mixture of 4 different VLPs, called a cocktail, or on a single VLP presenting all 4 HA proteins, called a mosaic) generated equal or superior neutralizing responses to the homologous influenza virus as commercial QIV. Importantly, antibodies induced by the VLPs were better able to neutralize viruses that were mismatched to the vaccine strain than QIV. This included strains of avian influenza such as H5N1 that were absent from the vaccine, the mechanism of which was thought to be in part based on the induction of “universal” antibodies (i.e., anti-HA stalk, the portion of HA that is directly responsible for membrane fusion and viral entry into the cell) that are not readily induced by QIV.
 

Source: Boyoglu-Barnum et al. 2021
 The ability to neutralize “drifted” strains is potentially indicative of a broader immune response that could provide superior protection in years when the selection of antigens for influenza vaccines is imperfectly matched to the dominant circulating strains. In addition, the ability to generate neutralizing antibodies against H5N1 with seasonal HA antigens suggests VLP-based vaccines could potentially contribute to protection against influenza pandemics. The NIH is currently running a Phase 1 trial with mosaic VLPs based on the two-component VLP platform, with initial results expected in 2023.
 

Influenza Candidate Development
Icosavax is developing a recombinant influenza vaccine candidate based on the two-component VLP platform. We licensed the rights to develop and commercialize an influenza VLP vaccine from UW based on technology developed by UW and NIH, and in December 2022, we also entered into a patent license agreement with UW for use of modified neuraminidase antigens developed by UW and the NIH in the influenza field. We have initiated preclinical development on influenza HA and NA antigens with the goal to select a candidate in 2023. We see our emerging influenza program as part of our strategy to develop combination or pan-respiratory VLP vaccines targeting the viral causes of pneumonia in older adults.
SARS-CoV-2 Program
 We are developing a preclinical bi-valent VLP vaccine candidate displaying computationally engineered RBD antigens for SARS-CoV-2, with the goal to select a candidate in 2023. Specifically, given the evolving pandemic, we are seeking to design antigen prototypes that would improve the stability of the RBD subdomain from the SARS2 S protein and allow for the successful presentation of any variant of interest, including omicron and subsequent derivatives. We are conducting this preclinical development work for optionality to include a SARS-CoV-2 candidate as a potential component of a future pan-respiratory combination vaccine candidate.
 For our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, we have a license from the UW that is nonexclusive worldwide, with the exception of South Korea (which is not included in the licensed territory). This license will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and the United Kingdom) starting in 2025 with non-exclusivity maintained elsewhere. SK Biosciences (SK) has also licensed the technology for use in COVID-19 vaccines. SK has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial and obtained marketing approval in South Korea for a COVID-19 vaccine based on this technology.
 Our Early-Stage Programs
 We are exploring several other viral and bacterial pathogens to potentially incorporate into VLP vaccine candidates that may be added to our pipeline in vaccine areas where a VLP approach can lead to a differentiated product profile. We review technical feasibility, demonstrated market need and potential and clinical program design and timelines with our outside scientific and commercial advisors and board of directors before selecting new vaccine programs for development.
Competition
 Overview
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant regulatory and technological change. The current vaccine market is concentrated among a few key global biopharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Sanofi, Pfizer, Moderna, and CSL Bering, which together account for the majority of vaccine sales globally. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions are also active in the vaccine market given the continuing global need for both existing and new vaccines. The large markets for respiratory virus vaccines make them attractive targets for new vaccines and we face competition from numerous vaccine developers. While we believe that our technology, strategy, and our employee and consultant knowledge and experience can provide us with competitive advantages, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, clinical development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our vaccine candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, reactogenicity, safety, breadth, durability, convenience, and price, the number of other vaccines on the market in the specific target indications, the recommendation of vaccines by policy makers, the inclusion of vaccines on the national immunization schedules, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 VLP-Based Vaccines
 A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing VLP or protein-based nanoparticle vaccine candidates. Some of these candidates are enveloped vaccines that require budding from the host cell membrane which can result in inclusion of host cell protein components leading to manufacturing complexities, such as additional purification needs. This includes, but is not limited to, VBI Vaccines. Other technologies incorporate the antigen to


naturally occurring viral VLP scaffolds which may be less flexible and suitable for presentation of complex antigens; this includes, but is not limited to, SpyBiotech. We are aware of other vaccine companies developing protein-based nanoparticle vaccines, such as ModeX, or those developing VLP technology that is closely related to ours, including UVax Bio. In addition, the field of VLP vaccines is increasingly competitive and we expect competition to intensify.
 RSV and hMPV Vaccines for Older Adults
 As of March 2023, there is no vaccine approved for prevention of disease due to RSV infections or for prevention of disease due to hMPV infections in any population, including older adults. We are aware of companies currently developing vaccines against RSV for use in older adults, including GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Bavarian Nordic, Janssen, Moderna, with vaccines developed by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline expected to receive FDA marketing approval in 2023. As far as we are aware, no company other than us has a VLP-based RSV vaccine in clinical trials. In addition, as far as we are aware, there are no companies with a vaccine in clinical development against hMPV for use in older adults, nor are there any companies with a vaccine in clinical development against the combination of RSV and hMPV for use in older adults; however, Moderna has an RSV and hMPV combination vaccine in preclinical development for pediatric use, and Sanofi has announced that it is exploring RSV monovalent and RSV and hMPV combination vaccines for older adults preclinically. We believe the induction of nAbs is key for both RSV and hMPV vaccine efficacy in older adults and that multivalent VLP display of the prefusion RSV and hMPV antigens on our VLP candidates has the potential to induce a stronger or more durable nAb response than other vaccine technologies.
 Influenza Vaccines
 We expect that, if approved, any influenza VLP candidate we develop will compete with currently approved vaccines against influenza. There are several vaccines approved for influenza, most of which are egg-based, including Fluzone, Fluad, and Fluarix manufactured by Sanofi, Seqirus, and GSK, respectively. There is one subunit protein-based vaccine marketed in the United States, Flublok, manufactured by Sanofi, and one mammalian cell-based vaccine marketed in the United States, Flucelvax, manufactured by Seqirus. Novavax also has an adjuvanted protein-based vaccine that has completed clinical studies as a monovalent and is in Phase 2 studies as a combination with Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine. There are currently no marketed VLP-based influenza vaccines. Three of the marketed influenza vaccines in the United States were recently recommended for older adult immunization by the ACIP: Fluzone High-Dose, Fluad, and Flublok. We anticipate that these vaccines will be our main competitors in the older adult market.
COVID-19 Vaccines
 Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax, along with many other companies, are currently marketing COVID-19 vaccines. We are also aware of numerous COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development, including VLP approaches being developed by Bavarian Nordic, SpyBiotech and VBI Vaccines. As mentioned above, we see our SARS-CoV-2 candidate as providing optionality for inclusion in a pan-respiratory candidate.
Combination Vaccines
 We expect increasing numbers of combination and pan-respiratory vaccine candidates. For example, Moderna is developing a COVID-19/influenza/RSV combination vaccine in Phase 1 and an RSV/hMPV combination vaccine preclinically, and Sanofi has a RSV/hMPV combination vaccine in preclinical development. We are unaware of any protein-based RSV/hMPV combination vaccines currently in clinical development in older adults other than IVX-A12.
Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any large-scale or current cGMP manufacturing facilities. To date, we have successfully worked in conjunction with our third-party manufacturers to complete development and cGMP manufacturing campaigns for key components, VLP drug substance, and formulated drug product for all of our vaccine candidates. We are working with our existing manufacturers to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans.
 To date, we do not own or manufacture adjuvants and for vaccine candidates that we move forward as adjuvanted vaccines, we must rely on non-proprietary commercially available adjuvants or access to proprietary adjuvants through license or supply agreements with adjuvant manufacturers.
 We believe our outsourced manufacturing strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need to for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, or personnel. This enables us to focus our time, expertise, and resources on the development of our vaccine candidates.
 

Commercialization Plan
 Our current development plans focus on development and regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe. We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States and Europe, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our vaccine candidates. We may work in partnership with one or more pharmaceutical partners for certain vaccine candidates, for certain target populations, or for certain geographies where we believe that others’ capabilities and resources may be ideally suited for development, commercialization, or distribution of our vaccine candidates.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining rights in patents intended to cover our current and future vaccine candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on our agreements with UW, NIH and UT for intellectual property rights that are important or necessary for the development of our vaccine candidates. We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 For each vaccine candidate we develop and plan to commercialize, as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition and preventative use patents. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel methods of manufacture, formulations, or antigen combinations. We have sought and plan to continue to seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators.
 Regardless of the coverage we seek in our patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may allow a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
 In summary, as of February 15, 2023, our patent estate of company-owned and licensed rights included eight issued U.S. patents, 14 pending U.S. patent applications, five pending international (PCT) patent applications, as well as counterpart foreign patent applications. These include both claims directed to our VLP platform and our vaccine candidates. On a worldwide basis, our patent estate for our VLP platforms includes three U.S. patents, with pending continuation applications; more than 15 patents and patent applications jointly covering our RSV and hMPV products specifically; more than 10 patent applications covering other infectious disease targets; a non-exclusive license from UW to a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application covering coronavirus, that will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025; a non-exclusive license from UW to patent applications directed to nanoparticle-based influenza vaccines; and an exclusive license, with the exception of nucleic acid-based vaccines for which the license is non-exclusive, from UW to a patent application directed to engineered influenza neuraminidase antigens.
 More specifically, we have exclusively licensed our main VLP icosahedral platform (as well as several alternative platforms) from UW. Three issued U.S. patents that will expire in 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available, and one pending U.S. patent application include composition of matter claims directed to such platforms.
 We also have a license from UW to a pending U.S. patent with an expected expiry of 2034 with claims directed to the computational methods used to develop these and other two-component, symmetrical nanoparticles / VLPs. A parent application has already issued as a U.S. patent with an adjusted expiration date in 2036; it claims several tetrahedral nanoparticle / VLP platforms as compositions of matter. These blocking patent rights are joined by an issued U.S. patent and its continuation application, and by two issued U.S. patents and their continuation application, having actual or expected expirations in 2038 and 2036, respectively, that cover various alternative icosahedral nanoparticles.
 

For our RSV product, composition-of-matter and method-of-use patent rights are provided by a patent family being prosecuted in the United States and Europe, as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa. The U.S. and Australia patents that have issued, and any further patents that issue from this patent family, are expected to expire in 2038, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available. UW’s inter-institutional agreements (IIA) with the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, Switzerland conferred to UW the right to license this patent family to us.
 We have licensed certain patent rights from NIH directed to the antigenic portion of our RSV product for stabilization of the antigen in a prefusion conformation. These patent rights are assigned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), based on inventions made at the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Specifically, we have non-exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents directed to the compositions of matter, which will expire in 2034, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
HHS and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, Switzerland jointly own two U.S. patents directed to conformationally stabilized hMPV antigens, which we have non-exclusively licensed, subject to an inter-institutional agreement between HHS and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine. These two licensed patents are expected to expire in 2035. A continuation application and corresponding European patent application are currently pending in this patent family. The same non-exclusive license further includes an international patent application from HHS, also directed to conformationally stabilized hMPV antigens. Any patents that issue from this patent family are expected to expire in 2041, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
 The specific mutations found in our hMPV product are also protected by patent rights based on inventions made at the University of Texas. We have exclusively (for all vaccine fields other than mRNA) licensed one pending PCT patent application directed to composition of matter, national stage entries of which, if issued, will expire in 2041, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
 We also have a non-exclusive license from UW to a patent family with claims directed to our coronavirus vaccine candidate, which includes a pending PCT application. This non-exclusive license that will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025. We have also filed a company-owned PCT application with pharmaceutical composition and method of treatment claims related to a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Any patents that issue from this PCT application are expected to expire in 2042, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
 We have a non-exclusive license from UW and HHS to patents directed to nanoparticle-based influenza virus vaccines. Specifically, we have non-exclusively licensed a patent family being prosecuted in the United States and Europe, as well as in Australia, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea, which is directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use, and which will expire in 2040, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
 We have an exclusive license from UW and HHS under certain patent applications directed to engineered influenza neuraminidase (NA) antigens for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of influenza that includes a neuraminidase antigen, except that such license is non-exclusive with respect to nucleic acid based delivery mechanisms for delivery of neuraminidase antigens. Specifically, we have exclusively licensed a patent family being prosecuted in the United States and Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, which is directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use. Any patents that issue in this patent family are expected to expire in 2041, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available.
 Further patent protected related to other indications is provided by a family of more than 10 patent applications filed in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, which is also exclusively licensed in relevant fields from UW. Any patents that ultimately issue from this patent family are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustment or extension that may potentially be available. Foreign jurisdictions where patent applications are pending include Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe including the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Russia, Vietnam and South Africa.
 We continue to prepare and file provisional patent applications directed to vaccine composition improvements, manufacturing methods, and formulations, as appropriate.
 

For more information regarding our license agreements with UW, UT, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, please see “—Material Agreements.”
 Generally, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than twelve months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
 We file U.S. non-provisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application and to designate all of the 153 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications.
 At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future vaccine candidates or for our platform technology. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 In addition to patents, we have trademark registrations in the U.S., European Union and United Kingdom for ICOSAVAX and our company logo. We also have pending trademark applications for ICOSAVAX and our company logo in the U.S. Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed, or expect to be able to license on commercially reasonable terms, rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our future products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

 Material Agreements
 Agreements with University of Washington
 License Agreement with respect to RSV and Other Pathogens
 In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement with UW as amended in July 2019, November 2020, and June 2022 (UW License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW License Agreement, UW granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any product covered by the licensed patents, or licensed products, for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of RSV infection and eight other infectious diseases. UW also granted us a non-exclusive license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such designs, and relate to our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology as well as certain one-component virus-like-particle technology. As of March 2023, the UW License Agreement is applicable to our IVX-121, IVX-241, and IVX-A12 programs.
 The rights granted to us by UW are subject to certain rights of UW, the United States federal government, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). UW retained rights under the licensed patents for research and educational purposes and for UW to comply with its obligations under applicable laws for federally funded inventions. The federal government has (i) a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to the licensed patents, (ii) march-in rights exercisable if public health crises so demand, and (iii) to the extent required by Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, a requirement that for any products licensed for use in the United States, that these products be substantially manufactured in the United States, because the inventions covered by the licensed patents arose in whole or in part from federal funding. HHMI has a paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable, irrevocable license for research use owing to the involvement of HHMI employees in developing the inventions of the licensed patents. HHMI’s right to sublicense is limited to non-profit and governmental entities.
 Owing to grant funding provided to UW by BMGF in connection with the licensed patents and know-how, UW granted a humanitarian license and made certain global access commitments with respect to the funded developments for six of the nine pathogens (excluding RSV and two others) for humanitarian purposes if UW has utilized grant funding to support its efforts with regards to any of these six pathogens. UW may require us to grant sublicenses to third parties to make such licensed developments available at an affordable price in developing countries, or if we do not offer such sublicenses on reasonable terms, UW may grant such licenses directly to third parties to enable affordable access in developing countries. Currently, our hMPV vaccine program is the only active program subject to this UW humanitarian license to BMGF.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently develop, manufacture, and commercialize vaccines incorporating the licensed products, and to achieve specified development and regulatory milestone events, including, with respect to IVX-121, initiating clinical trials of specified phases by certain dates between 2022 and 2026 and making first commercial sale by a specified date thereafter, and with respect to IVX-241 and IVX-A12, conducting activities necessary to enable clinical trials and initiating clinical trials of specified phases, in each case, by certain specified dates between 2022 and 2028, and making first commercial sale by a specified date thereafter. If we are unable to meet our diligence obligations and cannot agree with UW to modify such obligations or do not cure by meeting such obligations, then UW may terminate the UW License Agreement in whole, or in part, on a pathogen-by-pathogen basis.
 In connection with the execution of the UW License Agreement, we issued 192,276 shares of our common stock to UW in August 2018. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee in the mid four figures. We are required to


pay UW development and regulatory milestone payments up to an aggregate amount of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for each of the nine licensed vaccine candidates. We are also required to pay UW commercial milestone payments of one million dollars for each of the nine licensed vaccine candidates upon reaching a certain net sales threshold. We are also required to pay UW a fixed low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third-party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the licensed products, and we are not required to pay duplicate royalties for combination products incorporating technology covered by multiple UW license agreements. After first commercial sale of a licensed product, we must meet a certain minimum royalty requirement in the low to mid five figures range on an annual basis. If we sublicense our rights under the UW License Agreement, we are obligated to pay UW a mid-single digit to mid-double digit percentage of all sublicensing revenue received, depending on when we grant such sublicenses in relation to the development stage of the most advanced licensed product, and adjusted for any development expenses and development or regulatory milestone payments already made.
 The UW License Agreement will remain in effect until all licensed patent rights have terminated and all obligations due to UW have been fulfilled. The last-to-expire licensed patents, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available. UW can terminate the UW License Agreement if we breach or fail to perform one of our material duties under the UW License Agreement and our unable to remedy the default within an agreed upon time period that can be extended by UW. We can terminate the UW License Agreement at will with prior written notice to UW. We can also terminate certain of our licensed rights through an amendment to the UW License Agreement.
 Option and License Agreement with Respect to COVID-19
 In July 2020, we entered into an option and license agreement with UW, as amended in August 2020, May 2021, and July 2022 (UW Option and License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW Option and License Agreement, UW granted to us a non-exclusive, worldwide (excluding South Korea), sublicensable license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, or otherwise exploit any product covered under the licensed patents for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. UW also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such designs, and used in our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology. As of March 2023, the UW Option and License Agreement is applicable to our SARS-CoV-2 program.
 The license included, and we have since exercised, an option to obtain an exclusive license under the UW Option and License Agreement for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the countries of the European Patent Organization (including Switzerland and the United Kingdom) starting in 2025. There was no option exercise fee. However, the option right is subject to certain rights of the United States federal government, UW, BMGF, and HHMI, as described above in connection with the UW License Agreement.
 We are required to pay UW a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the licensed products. However, we are not required to pay duplicate royalties on net sales of any licensed products under the UW Option and License Agreement if we are already required to pay royalties on such net sales under the UW License Agreement.
 Our diligence obligations under the UW Option and License Agreement and the parties’ rights to terminate the UW Option and License Agreement are substantially the same as the analogous obligations and rights under the UW License Agreement. We incorporate the descriptions above regarding termination rights by reference. The last-to-expire relevant patents under the UW Option and License Agreement, if issued, are expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available.
 License Agreement with Respect to Influenza
In September 2021, we entered into a license agreement with UW (UW Flu License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW Flu License Agreement, UW granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (subject to certain restrictions) license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any product covered by the licensed patents (Licensed Flu Products), for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of influenza. UW also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such


designs, and relate to our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology and nanoparticle-based influenza virus vaccines. As of March 2023, the UW Flu License Agreement is applicable to our preclinical influenza program.
 The United States federal government and HHMI have similar rights under the UW Flu License Agreement and the UW License Agreement described above in “License Agreement with respect to RSV and Other Pathogens”.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Licensed Flu Products, and to initiate a clinical trial with respect to such Licensed Flu Products by a specified date in 2025. If we are unable to initiate a clinical trial by the specified date and cannot agree with UW to modify such obligation or do not cure by meeting such obligation, then UW may terminate the UW Flu License Agreement.
Under the UW Flu License Agreement, we paid UW a one-time upfront license fee, and after September 2023 and for the remainder of the term of the UW Flu License Agreement, we are required to pay tiered minimum annual fees ranging from the mid four figures to the mid five figures, with such fees creditable against royalty payments. We are required to pay UW up to an aggregate of $350 thousand for payments related to development milestones and up to an aggregate of $6 million for payments related to commercial milestones based upon reaching certain cumulative net sales thresholds for all Licensed Flu Products. We are also required to pay UW a fixed low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of Licensed Flu Products by us and our sublicensees, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third-party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the Licensed Flu Products. We are not obligated to pay duplicate royalties on net sales of any Licensed Flu Products if we are already required to pay a royalty on such net sales under the UW License Agreement or the UW Option and License Agreement.
 The UW Flu License Agreement will remain in effect until all licensed patent rights have terminated and all obligations due to UW have been fulfilled. The last-to-expire licensed patent, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available. UW can terminate the UW Flu License Agreement if we breach or fail to perform one of our material duties under the UW Flu License Agreement and are unable to remedy the default within an agreed upon time period that can be extended by UW. We can terminate the UW Flu License Agreement at will with prior written notice to UW. We can also terminate certain of our licensed rights through an amendment to the UW Flu License Agreement.
 NIH Patent License Agreement
 On June 28, 2018, we and the NIAID of the NIH entered into a non-exclusive license agreement for certain intellectual property rights and biological materials, as amended on September 10, 2018 and September 9, 2020 (NIH Agreement). Pursuant to the NIH Agreement, NIAID granted us a worldwide, nonexclusive, sublicensable license to certain patent rights, data, information, and materials directed to immunogens and antibodies and components and processes thereof relating to RSV and hMPV to allow us to make, use, sell, offer to sell, and import adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccines that combine technology covered by the licensed patent rights with our proprietary protein-based nanoparticle technology, for the prevention, cure, amelioration or treatment of RSV and hMPV infections in humans, for administration alone or in combination with one or more other vaccines, and specifically excluding nucleic acid-based vaccines. NIAID also transferred to us certain biological materials relating to the foregoing for our development purposes. As of March 2023, the NIH Agreement is applicable to our IVX-121, IVX-241, and IVX-A12 programs.
 Pursuant to the NIH agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed products using the licensed processes to make the licensed products available to the United States public on reasonable terms, including by adhering to a commercial development plan and meeting specified benchmarks with regards to specified deadlines for regulatory filings, initiation of clinical trials, and gaining regulatory approval for the licensed products, in each case by certain specified dates between 2022 and 2032. To the extent required by Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, we agreed to manufacture substantially in the United States all licensed products that are to be used or sold in the United States, to make reasonable quantities of the licensed product, if commercialized, available to patient assistance programs in the United States, to develop educational materials relating to the licensed product, and to supply reasonable quantities of the licensed products made by the licensed processes to NIAID for research, education and display purposes.
 In consideration of the rights granted under the NIH Agreement, we paid NIAID a one-time upfront payment in the low six figures and amendment issue fees in the high five figures. We are required to make tiered, low single-digit percentage royalty payments on specified portions of annual net sales of licensed products outside of least developed


countries, subject to certain specified reductions if we are required to pay royalties to third parties in order to commercialize the license products. We are required to make aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.15 million for the approval of the first indication for a licensed product, up to $650,000 for the approval of the second indication for a licensed product, up to $375,000 for the approval of the third indication for a licensed product, and $50,000 for each subsequent indication. We are further required to make sales milestone payments upon achieving certain aggregate net sales thresholds for all licensed products of up to $6.5 million in aggregate. We are also required to pay NIAID a mid-single to low double-digit percentage of any sublicensing revenue we receive, depending on when we grant such sublicense in relation to the development stage of the licensed product and the number of indications that we sublicense. Additionally, our payment obligations to NIAID are subject to annual minimums ranging from low-mid five figures to low six figures depending on the year and commercialization stage.
 The NIH Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. NIAID may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach, our insolvency or bankruptcy. Further, NIAID has the right to terminate or modify the NIH Agreement if (i) we do not execute the commercial development plan, (ii) we do not take effective steps to develop the licensed products to make them available for the public on reasonable terms, (iii) we do not achieve specified benchmarks, (iv) we do not keep at least one licensed product or process available to the public after commercial use commences, (v) to the extent required to do so under Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, (vi) we do not receive a U.S. manufacturing waiver from NIAID, NIH and do not justify a failure to manufacture the licensed products substantially in the United States, if intending to use in the United States (vii) we do not reasonably satisfy the public use requirements specified under federal regulations, or (viii) we willfully make a false statement to or omit a material fact from NIAID in connection with the license application and progress reports. We have the unilateral right to terminate the NIH Agreement in its entirety or in any country with prior written notice to NIAID.
 Patent License Agreement with the University of Texas at Austin
 In June 2021, we entered into a patent license agreement (the UT License Agreement) with UT. Pursuant to the UT License Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license, under certain UT patent rights and know-how relating to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) antigen to manufacture, develop, use, sell, import, and otherwise exploit all vaccines covered by such patents or incorporating such know-how, except for mRNA-based vaccines. Our rights and obligations under the UT License Agreement, are subject to certain U.S. government rights and UT’s retained rights under the licensed patent rights for academic or non-commercial publication, manufacture, and use, including sublicensable rights to academic and non-profit institutions. As of March 2023, the UT License Agreement is applicable to our IVX-241 and IVX-A12 programs.
 Under the UT License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain specified development, sales and regulatory milestones related to the licensed products, including maintaining a reasonably funded active research, development, manufacturing, regulatory, marketing or sales program, as applicable and necessary to commercialize the licensed products, and in each case by certain specified dates between 2021 and 2030. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the UT License Agreement, we are required to pay UT an annual license fee, escalating from low to mid five figures dollars, until the first sale of a licensed product. There are milestone payments due upon the completion of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones for a licensed product in the future, with potential payments for such future development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones in the aggregate in the mid-single figure million dollars. Additionally, we have agreed to pay UT low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of all licensed products, with a reduced royalty rate if the licensed product expresses more than one unique antigen or if we are required to pay royalties to a third party for rights to such third party’s intellectual property in order to commercialize the licensed product. Our royalty payment obligations are subject to specified minimums in the mid-five to low-six figure dollars that are creditable to royalties owed. If we sublicense our rights under the UT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay UT a mid-single digit to low-mid-double digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing revenue received, depending on when we grant such sublicenses in relation to the development stage of the licensed product. We are also required to pay UT low six figure dollars if we assign the UT License Agreement to a third party.
 The UT License Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. We have the right to terminate the UT License Agreement by providing UT with prior written notice. UT may terminate the UT License Agreement in its entirety, or partially terminate the licensed patent rights, narrow the vaccine field, reduce the territory, or convert the license from exclusive to non-exclusive if we: (i) fail to meet our payment obligations, (ii) commit an uncured breach, (iii) commit three or more cured breaches within a specified time period, (iv) challenge the validity, enforceability, or scope of the licensed patent rights, or (v) undergo certain insolvency-related events.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our vaccine candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
 In the United States, biological products, or biologics, such as vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs and other applicable regulations;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 ▪approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic vaccine candidate for its intended use;
 ▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials and other necessary studies;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs); and
 ▪FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 

Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 ▪Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 ▪Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 ▪Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy or equivalent agreed endpoints and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A BLA for a fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 

Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
 Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements up. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 ▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 ▪clinical holds on clinical trials;
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 ▪the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 ▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the


FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the licensure of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any vaccine candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our vaccine candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 Certain ACA marketplace and other private payor plans are required to include coverage for certain preventative services, including vaccinations recommended by the ACIP without cost share obligations (i.e., co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance) for plan members. Children through 18 years of age without other health insurance coverage may be eligible to receive such vaccinations free-of-charge through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program. For Medicare beneficiaries, vaccines may be covered under either the Part B program or Part D depending on several criteria, including the type of vaccine and the beneficiary’s coverage eligibility. If our vaccine candidates, once approved, are covered only


under the Part D program, physicians may be less willing to use our products because of the claims adjudication costs and time related to the claims adjudication process and collection of co-payments associated with the Part D program.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Third-party payors may not consider our vaccine candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval.
 In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a vaccine candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing product pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union (EU) pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU member states’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices and reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available vaccines. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our vaccine candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, vaccine candidates launched in some foreign countries, such as some countries in the EU, do not follow price structures of the United States and prices generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates, and similar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the EU and other jurisdictions. Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which the average manufacturer price under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 

Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden had issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare product candidates and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our vaccine candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a vaccine candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the vaccine candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 

Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Preclinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for preclinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), guidelines on good clinical practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Certain countries and jurisdictions outside of the United States, including the EU, have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. A CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which became applicable in January 2022, there is a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorizations
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) which is valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference member state.
 

Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. Innovative medicines fulfilling a medical need may also benefit from different types of fast track approvals, such as a conditional MA or a MA under exceptional circumstances granted on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required (respectively in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe or when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization).
 Classical MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Foreign Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are


established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, transfer, processing, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other or other regulatory requirements complicating compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
