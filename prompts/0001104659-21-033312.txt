ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 

Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Clarus Corporation (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “our” or “us”), a company focused on the outdoor and consumer industries, is seeking opportunities to acquire and grow businesses that can generate attractive shareholder returns. The Company has net operating tax loss carryforwards which it is seeking to redeploy to maximize shareholder value. Clarus’ primary business is as a leading designer, developer, manufacturer and distributor of outdoor equipment and lifestyle products focused on the climb, ski, mountain, sport and skincare markets. The Company’s products are principally sold under the Black Diamond®, Sierra®, Barnes®, PIEPS® and SKINourishment® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, distributors and original equipment manufacturers throughout the U.S. and internationally.

Through our Black Diamond, PIEPS, and SKINourishment brands, we offer a broad range of products including: high-performance, activity-based apparel (such as shells, insulation, midlayers, pants and logowear); rock-climbing footwear and equipment (such as carabiners, protection devices, harnesses, belay devices, helmets, and ice-climbing gear); technical backpacks and high-end day packs; trekking poles; headlamps and lanterns; gloves and mittens; and skincare and other sport-enhancing products. We also offer advanced skis, ski poles, ski skins, and snow safety products, including avalanche airbag systems, avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes. Through our Sierra and Barnes brands, we manufacture a wide range of high-performance bullets and ammunition for both rifles and pistols that are used for precision target shooting, hunting and military and law enforcement purposes.

Clarus, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“Black Diamond Equipment”) in May 2010 and changed its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively, “PIEPS”).

On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock ticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange. On August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of SKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”).

On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities constituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”) for a purchase price of $30,500,000.

On August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of $0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis.  The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. On May 1, 2020, the Company announced that, in light of the operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its Board of Directors temporarily replaced its Quarterly Cash Dividend with a stock dividend (the “Quarterly Stock Dividend”). In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total Quarterly Cash Dividends were $1,520,000, $2,987,000 and $1,488,000, respectively.  In 2020, our total Quarterly Stock Dividends were $1,533,000. On January 29, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on February 19, 2021 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on February 8, 2021.

Impact of COVID-19

The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government in March 2020, with governments world-wide implementing safety measures restricting travel and requiring citizen lockdowns and self-confinements for quarantining purposes. This has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in significant transport restrictions and disruption of financial markets. The impact of this pandemic has created significant uncertainty in the global economy and has affected our business, employees, retail and distribution partners, suppliers, and customers. 

We experienced a decline in retail demand within our Black Diamond segment beginning in the second half of March 2020 through December 2020, which negatively impacted our sales and profitability for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. We also expect a continued impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (some of which are outside management’s control), including those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors.



We have mitigated some of the negative impacts to our operating results by taking significant actions to improve our current operating results and liquidity position, including drawing on the credit facility, suspending share repurchases, temporarily suspending cash dividends, postponing non-essential capital expenditures, reducing operating costs, modulating production in line with demand, and substantially reducing discretionary spending. We will continue to adjust mitigation measures as needed related to health and safety. Those measures have and might continue to include temporarily suspending manufacturing or retail operations, modifying workspaces, continuing social distancing policies, implementing new personal protective equipment or health screening policies at our facilities, or such other industry best practices needed to continue maintain a healthy and safe environment for our employees amidst the pandemic. 

These countermeasures partially mitigated the impacts of COVID-19 on our full year 2020 financial results. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess the impact on the Company and respond accordingly. 

Sustained adverse impacts to the Company, certain of its suppliers, dealers or customers may also affect the Company’s future cash flows, liquidity, and valuation of certain assets and therefore may increase the likelihood of an impairment charge, write-off, or reserve associated with such assets, including goodwill, indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment, inventories, accounts receivable, net deferred tax assets, and other assets.

Market Overview

Our primary target customers are outdoor-oriented consumers who enjoy active, outdoor-focused lifestyles. The users of our products are made up of a wide range of outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, mountaineers, trail runners, skiers, mountain bikers, backpackers and campers, competitive shooters, hunters and other outdoor-inspired consumers. We believe we have a strong reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety, and durability in our core product lines.

As the variety of outdoor sports activities continue to grow and proliferate, and existing outdoor sports evolve and become ever more specialized, we believe other outdoor companies are failing to address the unique technical and performance needs of enthusiasts involved in such specialized activities. We believe we have been able to help address this void in the marketplace by seeking to leverage our user intimacy and improving on our existing product lines by expanding our product offerings into new niche categories and products, and by incorporating innovative industrial design and engineering and performance tolerances into our products. We believe the credibility and authenticity of our brands expands our potential market beyond committed outdoor athletes to those outdoor generalist consumers who desire to lead active, outdoor-focused lifestyles.

Growth Strategies

Our growth strategies are to achieve sustainable, profitable growth organically while seeking to expand our business through targeted, strategic acquisitions. We intend to create innovative new products, increase consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our products, and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time across a growing number of geographic markets. 

Continue to Service and Grow Existing Accounts. We continue to seek to develop strong relationships with our key retail, distributor and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners through a mutual respect and admiration for the sports we serve. Through our various corporate initiatives, a focus on being easy to do business with, the extension of our existing product portfolios, and an emphasis on quality, on-time deliveries, brand awareness and marketing, we plan to grow our existing accounts as well as foster new relationships.

Broaden Distribution Footprint. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the presence and penetration of each of our brands outside of the U.S. market. The European alpine market is currently significantly larger than the U.S. market and is highly fragmented by country, with no clear leader across Europe. We have been able to gain market share by emphasizing our Black Diamond brand, positioning it as a global brand with American roots and PIEPS as a global brand with European roots. We believe there is also a significant opportunity to expand our Sierra and Barnes brands more extensively outside the U.S. market through additional sales and marketing investments.

New Product Development and Innovation. To drive organic growth within our existing businesses, we intend to leverage our strong brand names, customer relationships, proven capacity to develop new innovative products and product extensions in each of our existing product categories, and to expand into new product categories. Our new technologies are generally inspired by our continuing commitment to maximize the enjoyment and efficacy of the products for the outdoor sports for which we design.

Acquisition of Complementary Businesses. We expect to target acquisitions as a viable opportunity to gain access to new product groups, customer channels, and increase penetration of existing markets. We may also pursue acquisitions that diversify the Company within the outdoor and consumer markets. To the extent we pursue future acquisitions, we intend to focus on “super-fan” businesses with leading brands, recurring revenue, sustainable margins and strong cash flow. We anticipate financing future acquisitions prudently through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, bank financings, private placements and new capital markets offerings.

Diversified Portfolio by Product, Geography and Channel. Our business is highly diversified across products, geographies, and channels. We operate a multi-brand business with Black Diamond, PIEPS, Sierra, Barnes and SKINourishment branded products spanning 34 single product categories addressing four primary categories of climbing, skiing, mountain, and sport. Our bullet product category is the only product category that accounts for more than 15% of annual sales on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. This provides seasonal diversification with a balance of sales across both the fall/winter and spring/summer sports seasons. Our brands are truly global with approximately 61% of our sales on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated in over 50 countries outside the United States. We believe that our product, geographic, and distribution channel diversity allows us to maximize the reach of our brand portfolio while reducing the risk associated with any single product category or point of distribution.

Experienced and Incentivized Senior Management Team. The members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, including Mr. Warren Kanders, are substantial stockholders of the Company, and beneficially own approximately 28% of our outstanding common stock as of March 3, 2021, which we believe aligns the interests of our Board of Directors and our executive officers with that of our stockholders.

Growth-oriented Capital Structure. Our capital structure provides us with the capacity to fund future growth and our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to offset our net taxable income, which is expected to allow us to retain cash flow for future growth.

Operating Segments

We operate our business structure within two segments. These segments are defined based on the internal financial reporting used by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Certain significant selling and general and administrative expenses are not allocated to the segments. Each segment is described below:

Our Black Diamond segment, which includes Black Diamond Equipment, PIEPS, and SKINourishment, is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative outdoor engineered equipment and apparel for climbing, mountaineering, trail running, backpacking, skiing, and a wide range of other year-round outdoor recreation activities.

Products

Our products span 34 single product categories and include a wide variety of technical outdoor equipment and lifestyle products for a wide range of outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, mountaineers, trail runners, skiers, backpackers and campers, competitive shooters, hunters and other outdoor-inspired consumers. We design many of our products for extreme applications, such as high-altitude mountaineering, ice and rock climbing, as well as backcountry skiing and alpine touring. We also manufacturer high-quality bullets and ammunition with the tightest tolerances in the industry that enhance the performance of competitive shooters and hunters. We have also developed skincare products, such as lotions, lip balm, and sunscreen, as well as sport-enhancing supplements, nutrition, and other products using natural, organic or alternative ingredients.

We typically bring new products from concept to market in approximately 18 to 36 months depending upon the technology integration and complexity of the product. We work simultaneously on product lines for the four subsequent selling seasons.

We expense research and development costs as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2020, we had 80 employees dedicated to research and development.

Customers

We market and distribute our products in over 50 countries, primarily through independent specialty stores and specialty chains, premium sporting goods and outdoor recreation stores, distributors and OEMs in the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and South America. Outside of North America and Europe, we sell our products through independent global distributors into specialty retail stores. We also sell our products directly to customers through our various websites.

Our end users include a broad range of consumers, including mountain, rock, ice, and gym climbers, winter-outdoor enthusiasts, trail runners, backpackers, competitive shooters, hunters, and outdoor-inspired consumers. Such consumers demand high-quality, reliable, and high-precision products to enhance their performance and, in some cases, safety in a multitude of outdoor activities. We expect to leverage our user intimacy, engineering prowess, and design ability to expand into related technical product categories that target the same demographic group and distribution channels.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales force is generally deployed by geographic region: Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the United States. Our focus is on providing our products to a broad spectrum of outdoor enthusiasts. Within each of our brands, we strive to create a unique look for our products and to communicate those differences to the consumer. In addition, we are continuously exploring uses for brand and market research. We also regularly utilize various promotions and public relations campaigns.

We have consistently established relationships with professional athletes and influencers to help evaluate, promote and establish product performance and authenticity with customers. Such brand endorsers are one of many elements in our array of marketing materials, including instore displays, catalogs, workbooks, social media, and digital campaigns via our websites.

Manufacturing, Sourcing, Quality Assurance and Distribution

Manufacturing

Our objective is to deliver on-time the highest quality of products in the safest and most cost-efficient manner.  Our culture of continuous improvement and implementation of industry best practices, allows us to continue to increase productivity, reduce costs, and bring new innovative products to the market. 

The Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS manufacturing and distribution operations are ISO 9001–2015 certified and are audited annually by an independent certifying agency to ensure Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ quality management systems meet the requirements of ISO 9001–2015, and to ensure that Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ certified products meet all necessary performance certification requirements. Sierra and Barnes are members of the Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute and employ best-in-class proprietary manufacturing processes with respect to each one of its products. These processes are performed in-house and includes control of bullet jacket wall concentricity utilizing strict quality control standards overseen by experienced employees, yielding what we believe to be the tightest tolerances in the industry.

We manufactured approximately 30% to 35% of our products, including nearly all protection devices for climbing and all bullets, in our facilities in the United States. The remaining approximately 65% to 70% of our products are also manufactured to our specifications in third-party, independently-owned facilities. We keep employees and agents on-site or via regular visits at these third-party, independently-owned facilities to ensure that our products are manufactured to meet our specifications. While we do not maintain a long-term manufacturing contract with those facilities, we believe that our long-term relationships with them will help to ensure that a sufficient supply of goods built to our specification are available in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future.

Sourcing

We source raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers. Our primary raw materials include copper, lead, aluminum, steel, nylon, corrugated cardboard for packaging, metal, plastic and electrical components, and various textiles, foams, and fabrics. The raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal requirements.



We source packaging materials both domestically as well as from sources in Asia and Europe. We believe that all of our purchased products and materials could be readily obtained from alternative sources at comparable costs.

Quality Assurance

Quality assurance at the Company has two primary functions:

The first is to ensure that the products that we design and develop are manufactured to meet or exceed the Company’s own standards and international regulatory standards. This involves creating inspection documentation, reviewing manufacturing processes with our various vendor-partners, and inspecting finished product to assure it meets the rigorous standards required by our customers. These activities take place globally, wherever our products are manufactured.
The second function is to provide real and meaningful input to the new product development process. Quality assurance professionals interact closely with the design and engineering teams and bring knowledge and expertise to the design process, ensuring that the products we bring to market truly meet the criteria established when a new product is envisioned.
The engineering prowess of the quality assurance group is a core competency that the Company seeks to leverage across all product lines and brands.

Global Distribution

Our distribution model allows us to ship a broad cross-section of our product line in smaller quantities to our own global distribution centers and to those of our Independent Global Distributors (IGD) more frequently and at lower transportation and logistics costs.
Competition

Because of the diversity of our product offerings, we compete by niche with a variety of companies. Our products must stand up to the high standards set by the end users in each category where quality, durability and performance are paramount. We believe our products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance, marketing support, and price.

The popularity of various outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the desirability of our products. Therefore, we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, and by marketing our products in a persuasive and memorable fashion to drive consumer awareness and demand. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

We compete with niche, privately-owned companies as well as a number of brands owned by large, multinational companies, such as those set forth below.

Climb: Our climbing products and accessories, such as apparel, footwear, protection, carabiners, helmets, and harnesses, compete with products from companies such as La Sportiva, Prana, Patagonia, Petzl, CAMP, EDELRID, and Mammut.
Mountain: Our mountaineering products and accessories, such as backpacks, trekking poles, headlamps, and tents, compete with products from companies such as Petzl, Deuter, Leki, Komperdell, Marmot, Mountain Hardwear, Hestra, Osprey, Salomon, and The North Face.
Ski: Our skiing products and accessories, such as technical apparel, skis, poles, avalanche airbags and transceivers, compete with products from competitors such as Arc’Teryx, Backcountry Access, Dynafit (Salewa), Atomic, Mammut, Marker, Ortovox, Salomon, Scarpa, Scott, and Volkl.
Sport: We sell both bullets and ammunition to both retailers and distributors for sale to consumers but also supply bullets to OEMs who also sometimes manufacture bullets as well. Such companies include Vista (Federal Ammunition, CCI, and Remington), Nammo, Hornady, Fiocchi, and Olin (Winchester).
In addition, in certain categories we compete with certain of our large wholesale customers who focus on the outdoor market, such as REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Decathlon, which manufacture, market and distribute their own climbing, mountaineering, and skiing products under their own private labels.

Intellectual Property

We believe our registered and pending word and icon trademarks worldwide, including the Black Diamond and Diamond “C” logos, Black Diamond®, ATC ®, Camalot®, AvaLung ®, FlickLock®, Ascension™, Time is Life®, Hexentric®, Stopper®, Dawn Patrol®, Bibler®, “Use.Design.Build.Engineer.Repeat”®, Sierra®, Sierra® MatchKing®, Sierra® GameKing®, Sierra® BlitzKing®, Barnes®, TSX®, X Bullet®, VOR-TX® and PIEPS®, create international brand recognition for our products.

 


Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames referred to in this report may appear without the ® and ™ symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and tradenames.

We believe our brands have an established reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety, and durability, and accordingly, we actively monitor and police our brands against infringement to ensure their viability and enforceability.

In addition to trademarks, we hold over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide for a wide variety of technologies across our product lines.

Our success with our proprietary products is generally derived from our “first mover” advantage in the market as well as our commitment to protecting our current and future proprietary technologies and products, which acts as a deterrent to infringement of our intellectual property rights. While we believe our patent and trademark protection policies are robust and effective, if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our patents and trademarks but also include products containing proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing know-how.

We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. While we actively monitor our competitors to ensure that we do not compromise the intellectual property of others, we cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or void the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are in similar product niches as ours.

Seasonality

The Company’s products are outdoor activity-based, which results in seasonal variations in sales and profitability. On a calendar year basis, we generally experience our greatest sales in the first and second quarters for certain of our products including rock climbing gear, footwear, and harnesses, and in the third and fourth quarters for our ski, glove, ice climbing and snow safety products. Sales of these products may be negatively affected by unfavorable weather conditions and other market trends. During 2020, the fall/winter season represents approximately 61% of our sales on a pro forma basis while spring/summer represents approximately 39% of our sales on a pro forma basis. Sales of other products such as headlamps, lanterns, trekking poles, packs and bullets are generally balanced throughout the year.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital generally increases to support peak shipping periods and then generally decreases during the second quarter of the year as accounts receivable are collected.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not, and we believe in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Employees

As of December 31, 2020, we had over 600 employees worldwide. We have not experienced any work stoppages or employee-related slowdowns and believe that our relationship with employees is satisfactory.



Executive Officers of the Registrant

The executive officers of our Company as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:

Warren B. Kanders, 63, our Executive Chairman, has served as one of our directors since June 2002 and as Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors since December 2002.
