 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General 
GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its e-commerce properties and thousands of stores. 
Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2020 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2021 ("fiscal 2020"). Fiscal year 2019 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 1, 2020 ("fiscal 2019") and fiscal year 2018 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 2, 2019 ("fiscal 2018").
Reportable Segments
We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, which is the basis of how we manage the organization and analyze performance. Our sales and profits are driven through both our physical stores and broad e-commerce capabilities. Each segment consists primarily of retail operations, with the significant majority of our stores and e-commerce properties engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products). These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments. Through all of our channels, we sell various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software and also sell collectible products.
As of January 30, 2021, we had a total of 4,816 stores across all of our segments; 3,192 in the United States, 253 in Canada, 417 in Australia and 954 in Europe. Our stores and e-commerce sites operate primarily under the names GameStop® (“GameStop”), EB Games® (“EB Games”) and MicromaniaTM. 
Our segments also include 73 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers, with 48 collectibles stores in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture® brand and 25 stores in the United States operating under the ThinkGeek® brand. Our brands also include Game Informer® (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication.
Financial information about our segments is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 17, "Segment Information," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
Merchandise
We categorize our sale of products as follows:
•Hardware and Accessories.  We offer new and pre-owned video game platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 5 (2020), Microsoft Xbox Series X 
(2020) and the Nintendo Switch (2017). Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products and memory cards.
•Software.  We offer new and pre-owned video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content (“DLC”) and full-game downloads in our stores and e-commerce properties.
•Collectibles. Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes which are sold through our video game stores and e-commerce properties, and ThinkGeek® and Zing Pop Culture® stores. 
Trade-In Program
We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned video game products in our stores in exchange for cash or in-store credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. We believe this process drives our higher market share, particularly at new title releases and console launches. We resell these pre-owned video game products, which allows us to be one of the only suppliers of previous generation platforms and related video games. We also operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where defective video game products can be tested, repaired, relabeled, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for resale back to our stores and e-commerce properties.
Store Locations
Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 30, 2021, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,816 stores worldwide.

Business and Growth Strategies
In 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on a strategic path to fully leverage our unique position and brand in gaming. Our strategic plan is designed to stabilize and optimize our core business while at the same time pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Strategy.”
We utilize cash generated from operations, cash on hand and funds available to us under our revolving credit facility to fund our operations and in 2019 and 2020, Reboot transformation initiatives. We may also fund our operations and potential costs related to the acceleration of future transformation initiatives, such as product catalogue expansion efforts, as circumstances warrant, from other sources of capital, including sales of our equity and debt securities. In December 2020, we established an "at-the-market" offering program (the "ATM Program") that provides for the sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million, from time to time, through Jeffries LLC, as the sales agent under the ATM Program. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Through the date of this Form 10-K, we have not sold any shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program. Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs. The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock.
PowerUp Rewards
We operate loyalty programs in each of the countries in which we operate our stores. Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards® ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 47.1 million members as of January 30, 2021, of which approximately 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop® in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 4.4 million paying members. Our loyalty programs in our video game stores in the remaining countries had approximately 22.8 million members as of January 30, 2021. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive video game related rewards. The programs' paid memberships generally include a subscription to Game Informer® magazine and additional discounts and benefits in our stores and e-commerce properties.
Game Informer®
We publish Game Informer®, the world’s leading video game publication featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. Print and digital versions of the magazine are sold through 
subscriptions, digitally and through displays in our domestic and international stores. Game Informer® is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer® are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer® operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated.
Vendors
We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Purchases from the top ten vendors accounted for approximately 79% of our new product purchases in fiscal 2020. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, U&I Entertainment and Ubisoft Entertainment accounted for 31%, 22%, 9%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our new product purchases during fiscal 2020. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary video game product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. 
In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion. We believe that we have very good relationships with our vendors.
Distribution and Information Management
Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection for our customers to purchase what they want and how and when they want it. We use our distribution facilities, store locations, and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. In 2020, we introduced same day delivery service in certain markets to enhance the customer shopping and delivery experience. See Item 1A. Risk Factors -- Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business – “We depend on third-party delivery services to deliver products to our retail locations, processing centers and customers on a timely and consistent basis, and deterioration in our relationship with these third-party providers or increases in the fees that they charge could reduce our margins, harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial condition.”
Competition
The video game industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and related specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products and other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy") and Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include JB HiFi stores, Big W, and Target.
Market Size
Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD"), International Development Group ("IDG") and DFC Intelligence ("DFC"), we estimate that the market for new physical console video game products was approximately $18.0 billion in 2020 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned video game products, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms. Additionally, based on estimates compiled by DFC, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was approximately $26.0 billion in 2020.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we generated approximately 42% and 34%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter.
Trademarks 
We have a number of trademarks and servicemarks, including “GameStop®,” “Game Informer®,” “EB Games®,” “Electronics Boutique®,” “ThinkGeek®,” “Zing Pop Culture®,” “Power to the Players®” and “PowerUp Rewards®,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and servicemarks, including “MicromaniaTM,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks.
Human Capital 
We believe our business model provides our associates with many opportunities to develop and grow their careers at GameStop. We are committed to the ongoing talent development of all GameStop associates and offer rewarding learning opportunities through our proprietary training programs and high-potential talent development programs as well as educational assistance programs. At GameStop, we advocate working actively to build understanding and collaboration across our family of brands. We believe a more diverse workforce provides many benefits in drawing upon a greater richness of resources, experiences, ideas and talents. We believe these measures help us retain our associates and attract new talent to support our strategy. 
We have approximately 12,000 full-time salaried and hourly associates and between 17,000 and 23,000 part-time hourly associates worldwide, depending on the time of year. The number of part-time hourly associates fluctuates due to the seasonality of our business. We believe that our relationship with our associates is good.
Given our global operations, we monitor local labor and employment laws in order to offer our associates wages and benefits packages that are in line with respective local labor markets and laws. While some of our international associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements, none of our U.S. associates are represented by a labor union or are members of a collective bargaining unit.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized the health and safety of our associates and implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our associates as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes included encouraging the vast majority of our corporate associates to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for associates continuing critical on-site work. During fiscal year 2020, we incurred approximately $25 million in costs to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic including costs related to incremental wage payments to hourly associates to help offset lost wages due to store closures, enhanced cleaning measures and expanded use of personal protective equipment at our stores, shared service centers and distribution centers across all geographies where we operate. We anticipate that we will continue to incur these costs well into the fiscal year 2021.
Sustainability
We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take in software (CDs), gaming consoles and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2020 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, we refurbished over 2.7 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 2.2 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 0.5 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease over our baseline year of 2009, as well as a 20% reduction in year over year carbon emissions achieved through both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. See the Social Responsibility section of our corporate website (http://news.gamestop.com/social-responsibility) for further information on our sustainability efforts.
