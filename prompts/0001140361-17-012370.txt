Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General
 
Systemax Inc. is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label products. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the Company have been in business since 1949. Our headquarters office is located at 11 Harbor Park Drive, Port Washington, New York.
 
Recent developments
 
The Company currently operates and is internally managed in two reportable segments - Industrial Products Group (“IPG”) and EMEA Technology Products Group (“EMEA”). Smaller business operations and corporate functions are aggregated and reported as an additional segment – Corporate and Other (“Corporate”).  As previously disclosed in December 2015, the Company sold certain assets and liabilities of North American Technology Group (“NATG”) business and at that time began the wind-down of the remaining business.  This wind-down is substantially completed although the Company has continued with collecting accounts receivable, settling accounts payable, marketing remaining leased facilities, as well as, settling remaining lease obligations and other contingencies during the current year. These wind-down activities will continue in 2017.
 
On September 2, 2016 the Company sold certain assets of its Misco Germany operations which had been reported as part of its EMEA segment. As this disposition was not a strategic shift with a major impact as defined under ASU 2014-08 (described below), prior and current year results of the German operations are presented within continuing operations in the consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales of Misco Germany included in continuing operations were $33.9 million and the net loss, including approximately $3.7 million of intercompany charges, was $6.4 million.
 
At December 31, 2016, the Company sold its rebate processing business which had been reported as part of its Corporate and Other (“Corporate”) segment.  As this disposition was also not a strategic shift with a major impact as defined under ASU 2014-08 (described below), prior and current year results of the rebate processing business are presented within continuing operations in the consolidated financial statements.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales of the rebate processing business included in continuing operations were $3.7 million and the net loss was $2.3 million. The Company recorded a gain on this sale in 2016 of approximately $3.9 million.
 
Operating History and Restructuring of NATG Operations
 
As disclosed in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2015, the Company announced a restructuring of its NATG business in March 2015. The NATG segment sold products categorized as Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”) and Consumer Electronics (“CE”) products.  These products included computers, computer supplies and consumer electronics which were marketed in North America. The Company followed the guidance under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which required disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation.  Under ASU 2014-08 in order for a disposal to qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements, the disposal must be a “strategic shift” with a major impact for the reporting entity. If the entity meets this threshold, only the components that were in operation at the time of disposal are presented as discontinued operations. The sale of the NATG business in December 2015 had a major impact on the Company and therefore met the strategic shift criteria. The NATG components in operation at the time of the sale were the B2B and Ecommerce businesses and three remaining retail stores. Accordingly, these components and the results of operations have been adjusted in the accompanying financial statements to reflect their presentation in discontinued operations. For a discussion of the accounting and wind-down of the NATG business, see Note 1, Note 3 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
 
Industrial Products
 
IPG sells a wide array of maintenance, repair and operational (“MRO”) products which are marketed in North America.  Most of these products are manufactured by other companies; however, the Company does offer a selection of products that are manufactured for our own design and marketed under the trademarks: Global™, GlobalIndustrial.com™, Nexel™ Relius™, Paramount™ and Interion™.  Industrial products accounted for 43%, 38% and 26% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively reported on a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) basis.

Technology Products – EMEA
 
EMEA sells products categorized as ICT and CE as well as related technical services such as configuration, implementation, network security, and other technical services. These products are primarily marketed in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden and related technical services are marketed in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Substantially all of these products are manufactured by other companies.  EMEA accounted for 57% of our GAAP net sales from continuing operations in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Technology Products – NATG
 
NATG sold ICT and CE products.  These products were marketed in North America.  Substantially all of these products were manufactured by other companies; however, the Company did offer a selection of products that were manufactured for our own design and marketed on a private label basis.  NATG accounted for 0%, 5% and 17% of our GAAP net sales from continuing operations in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
See Note 3 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.
 
Products
 
We offer over a million brand name and private label products. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers.
 
MRO products offered by our IPG segment include electrical and bulbs; fasteners and hardware; foodservice and appliances; furniture and office; HVAC/R fans; janitorial and maintenance; material handling; medical and laboratory equipment; metalworking and cutting tools; motors and power transmission; office and school supplies; outdoor and grounds maintenance; packaging and supplies; plumbing supplies; pneumatics and hydraulics; raw material and building supply; safety and security; storage and shelving; tools and instruments; vehicle maintenance and workbench and shop desks.
 
ICT products offered by our EMEA segment include: servers-storage and backup, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, monitors, mobile devices; computer parts and memory; computer components and accessories; networking and security; software; electronics and commercial and home networking.  CE products include TV and video; audio; cameras and surveillance; GPS; cell phones; video games; home and electronics accessories.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products primarily to B2B customers, which include for-profit businesses, educational organizations and government entities. We have developed numerous proprietary customer and prospect databases. We have established a multi-faceted direct marketing system to business customers, consisting primarily of our relationship marketers, catalog mailings and proprietary internet websites, the combination of which is intended to maximize sales.
Relationship Marketers
 
Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Systemax account manager. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. In certain countries, we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (“EDI”) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers’ efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and visits to our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly over the Internet. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe email campaigns, and to a lesser extent catalog mailings which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.

E-commerce
 
We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:
 

North America | Europe 
---------------------------+---------------------
www.globalindustrial.com | www.misco.co.uk 
www.globalindustrial.ca | www.misco.fr 
www.nexelwire.com | www.misco.nl 
www.chdistgov.com | www.misco.it 
www.industrialsupplies.com | www.misco.es 
 | www.misco.se 
 | www.misco.be 
 | www.inmac-wstore.com

 
We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. Our internet sites feature over a million MRO and ICT products.  Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers’ interests.
 
In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide “click-throughs” from their sites directly to ours.  These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.
 
Catalogs
 
As IPG and EMEA have increased their focus on online and e-commerce advertising, marketing and sales activities, they have decreased their use of hard copy catalogs over the last several years, and currently distribute fewer regular and specialty catalogs than in prior periods.
Customer Service, Order Fulfillment and Support
 
We generally receive orders through the Internet, by telephone and by EDI.  We generally provide toll-free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary.  Certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service.
 
Certain of our products are carried in stock, and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our North American and European distribution centers, typically within one day of the order. Orders are generally shipped by third-party delivery services.  We maintain relationships with thousands distributors and product vendors in North America and Europe that also deliver products directly to our customers.
 
We maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives, enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions.  We conduct regular on-site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors. Two vendors accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in 2016: one vendor accounted for 15.2% and another vendor accounted for 13.8%.  Two vendors accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in 2015 and 2014: one vendor accounted for 12.2% and 12.6%, respectively; another vendor accounted for 10.9% and 11.6%, respectively.  Excluding NATG operations, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in 2015 or 2014.  The loss of these vendors, or any other key vendors, could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications.
 
Competition and Other Market Factors
 
Industrial Products
 
The market for the sale of industrial products in North America is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships, direct mail distribution, internet-based resellers, large warehouse stores and retail outlets. We face competition from large diversified MRO distributors such as Grainger Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Inc., Fastenal Inc., and other large retailers, including e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.  We also face competition from manufacturers’ own sales representatives, who sell industrial equipment directly to customers, and from regional or local distributors.  Many high volume purchasers, however, utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price, product selection, product availability, level of service and convenience.  We believe that direct marketing via sales representatives, the internet and catalogs are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach mid-sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products.  In addition, because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented, we believe it is well suited to private label products.

Technology Products
 
The market for selling technology product is highly competitive, with many U.S., European and Asian companies vying for market share. We face competition from large resellers such as Econocom, Computacenter, Insight and other large retailers. There are few barriers to entry, with these products being sold through multiple channels of distribution, including direct marketers, computer resellers, mass merchants, over the internet, local and national retail computer stores, and by computer and office supply superstores.
 
Timely introduction of new products or product features and services are critical elements to remaining competitive. Other competitive factors include product performance, quality and reliability, technical support and customer service, marketing and distribution and price. Some of our competitors have stronger brand-recognition, broader product lines and greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources than us.
 
Conditions in the EMEA market for technology products remain highly competitive, resulting in our frequent discounting of product sales price as well as offering free or highly discounted freight.  These actions have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits.  Additionally, we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long-term sales growth and profitability.  There is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed a total of approximately 2,800 employees, of whom 1,200 were in North America and 1,600 were in Europe and Asia.
 
Seasonality
 
Seasonality does not have a material effect on the Company’s continuing IPG and EMEA businesses.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Under various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations in North America, Europe and Asia, a current or previous owner or operator (including the lessee) of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault.  We lease most of our facilities.  In connection with such leases, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances.  Although we have not been notified of, and are not otherwise aware of, any material real property environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future.
Financial Information About Foreign And Domestic Operations
 
We currently sell substantially all of our products through established sales channels to our customers in North America (primarily the United States and Canada) and Europe. We also export product to customers located outside of our established sales channels which export sales are de minimis in relation to our overall sales total.  Approximately 58.8%, 63.5%, and 65.6% of our GAAP net sales from continuing operations during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively were made by subsidiaries located outside of the United States.  For information pertaining to our international operations, see Note 12, “Segment and Related Information,” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
