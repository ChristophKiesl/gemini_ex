Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 BigCommerce is leading a new era of ecommerce. Our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform simplifies the creation of beautiful, engaging online stores by delivering a unique combination of ease-of-use, enterprise functionality, and flexibility. We power both our customers’ branded ecommerce stores and their cross-channel connections to popular online marketplaces, social networks, and offline point-of-sale (“POS”) systems. 
 BigCommerce empowers businesses to turn digital transformation into a competitive advantage. We allow merchants to build their ecommerce solution their way with the freedom of choice that makes the most sense for their unique business and product offerings.  We provide a comprehensive platform for launching and scaling an ecommerce operation, including store design, catalog management, hosting, checkout, order management, reporting, and pre-integrations into best of breed third-party services like payments, shipping and fulfillment, point of sale, marketing and accounting.
 
We target the following business segments:
  
● | small businesses (“SMBs”), which we define as sites with annual online sales less than $1 million,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the mid-market, which we define as sites with annual online sales between $1 million and $50 million, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large enterprises, which we define as sites with annual online sales from $50 million to billions of dollars.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We serve these segments with a platform offering enterprise-grade functionality, openness and performance capabilities with SMB friendly simplicity and ease-of-use. Our platform is the result of a multi- year investment in platform transformation. In nearly every component of our platform, we have added advanced functionality and openness using application programming interface (“API”) endpoints. 
 We strive to provide the world’s best SaaS ecommerce platform for all customers and all stages of customer growth. Our platform serves customers across a wide variety of sizes, product categories, and purchase types, including business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”). For the mid-market and large enterprise segments, we believe our platform combines three elements not typically offered together:
  
• | Multi-tenant SaaS. The speed, ease-of-use, high-performance, and continuously-updated benefits associated with multi-tenant SaaS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise functionality. Enterprise-grade functionality capable of supporting sophisticated use cases and significant sales volumes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open SaaS. Platform-wide APIs that enable businesses to customize their sites and integrate with external applications and services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe this powerful combination makes ecommerce success at scale more economically and operationally achievable than ever before.
 We have become a leader in both branded-site and cross-channel commerce. Cross-channel commerce involves the integration of a customer’s commerce capabilities with other sites—online and offline—where consumers and businesses make their purchases. We offer free, direct integrations with leading social networks such as Facebook and Instagram, search engines such as Google, online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, and POS platforms such as Square, Clover (a Fiserv company), and Vend. A dynamic and growing cross-channel category is “headless commerce,” which refers to the integration of a back-end commerce platform like ours with a front-end user experience separately created in a content management system (“CMS”) or design framework. The most dynamic and interactive online user experiences are often created using these tools. We integrate seamlessly with the leading CMSs, digital experience platforms, design frameworks, and custom front ends.
 Partners are essential to our open strategy. We believe we possess one of the deepest and broadest ecosystems of integrated technology solutions in the ecommerce industry. We strategically partner with, rather than compete against, the leading providers in adjacent categories, including payments, shipping, POS, CMS, customer relationship management (“CRM”), and enterprise resource planning (“ERP”). Our partner-centric strategy stands in contrast to our largest competitors, which operate complex software stacks that compete across categories. We focus our research and development investments in our core product to create a best-of-breed ecommerce platform. We believe this strategy has four advantages:
  
• | Core product focus. We can create the industry’s best ecommerce platform and innovate faster than our competition by focusing development on a single core product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Best-of-breed choice. We offer our customers the choice of best-of-breed, tightly integrated solutions across verticals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cooperative marketing and sales. We co-market and co-sell with our strategic technology partners in each category.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High gross margins. We earn high-margin revenue share from a subset of our strategic technology partners, and this complements the high gross margin of our core ecommerce platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our business has achieved significant growth since our inception. We had total revenues of $152.4 million, $112.1 million and $91.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in our “Open SaaS” strategy, building new partnerships and continuing to develop a

platform that offers best-of-breed functionality with the cost-effectiveness of multi-tenant SaaS. As we work to develop and deliver this platform for our customers, we will also invest and grow our business by acquiring additional customers to our platform, growing our revenue with existing customers, and expanding our presence in new segments and geographies. 
 We have invested, and intend to continue our disciplined investment strategy to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, including increasing the breadth and depth of our agency and technology partner ecosystem, enhancing our platform developments, and scaling our operations to support our existing and growing customer base.  We incurred net losses of $37.6 million, $42.6 million and $38.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
Impact of COVID-19
 COVID-19, declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused disruption to the economies and communities of the United States and our target international markets. In the interest of public health, many governments closed physical stores and places of business deemed non-essential. This precipitated a significant shift in shopping behavior from offline to online. Our business has benefitted from this shift, both in accelerated sales growth for our existing customers’ stores, and in our sales of new store subscriptions to customers. Nevertheless, we do not have certainty that those trends will continue; the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty it has created in the global economy could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 on our business, refer to “Risk Factors,” as well as our commentary in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Impact on operations
 Beginning in March 2020 and continuing for the remainder of the year, in compliance with local, state, and national regulations, we closed our major offices in Austin, San Francisco, Sydney, and London, and transitioned in an orderly fashion to work-from-home operations. We accomplished this transition efficiently across our various global teams and functions. Our employees and teams were equipped with the equipment and collaboration tools they need to successfully work remotely.
 As of December 31, 2020, our average uptime for 2020 was 99.98%. We consider this to be strong performance given the increase in site traffic and volume since the start of the pandemic. During the pandemic, we completed the rollout of our new storefront architecture and our customer service teams completed the transition to work-from-home while maintaining industry leading service levels.
 
We have been and expect to continue to be responsive to the evolving guidance of local authorities. We plan to begin reopening our offices as local regulations and conditions allow. We believe that we are well equipped to support full or partial remote work without major service disruption.
 Impact on ecommerce sector and our sales efforts
 Since March 2020, ecommerce sales in the United States and our target international markets have increased significantly due to pandemic-related changes in consumer and customer behavior. In turn, the macroeconomic trend towards ecommerce has accelerated.
 Since the onset of the pandemic, we have generally experienced a shortening of sales cycles and an improvement in lead conversion and competitive win rates. Sales of Essentials plans increased, particularly early in the pandemic, as we supported merchants’ efforts to get online through our 90-day free site wide promotion on Essentials plans. We have also seen strengthening in Enterprise plan sales during the pandemic, with Enterprise ARR growing 51% in 2020 versus 2019, compared to 44% growth in 2019 versus 2018.
 Impact on revenue
 We believe the shift to ecommerce following the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our subscription solutions revenue and our partner and services revenue.
 The pandemic-related increase in subscription solutions revenue is reflected in the growth in new customer bookings, continued strength in retention of existing customers, and increased subscription fees. Subscription solutions revenue grew year-over-year by 22.4%, 18.9%, 26.3%, and 33.1% in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter of 2020, respectively.
 We believe the pandemic has also contributed to higher partner and services revenue through increased platform transaction volume with our technology partners. Partner and services revenue grew year-over-year by 51.8%, 74.3%, 82.1%, and 54.3% in the first quarter, second quarter third quarter, and fourth quarter of 2020, respectively.
 While we expect the macroeconomic shift towards ecommerce to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic abates, elevated levels of new customer bookings and platform transaction volume may recede as pandemic-related restrictions eventually ease.
 
Industry trends
 Online shopping behaviors are evolving as ecommerce adoption is accelerating around the world. This puts tremendous pressure on businesses to pursue digital transformation with technology that innovates as fast as the market. Consumers are rapidly changing how they shop across online and offline channels. Businesses must address the breadth of touch points influencing what and where shoppers buy, including content sites (information and influencers), social networks, search engines, marketplaces, and of course, their own branded sites. While consumer brands 
 3


historically relied on retail distribution for their products, ecommerce enables a new model of direct-to-consumer, vertically-integrated digitally native brands. Historically, B2B ecommerce adoption has lagged that of B2C, but that is changing. B2B sellers are embracing digital transformation in pursuit of both efficiency and sales effectiveness, in response to business buyers whose user experience expectations have been reshaped by B2C shopping.
 Technology, infrastructure and operations
 We have designed our platform with enterprise-grade security, reliability, and scalability as top priorities. Our platform is built using best-of-breed open source technologies, deployed across geographically-distributed data centers, primarily on Google Cloud Platform. Our platform is subject to a rigorous set of security standards designed to ensure the security of customer data. Our server response time and page-load speeds are faster than other leading ecommerce platforms.  
 Our customers
 We serve a range of customer sizes, geographies, and customer segments including B2C, B2B, and DNBs. We distinguish market segments based on annual gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) per site, specifically: SMB ($0 to $1 million), mid-market ($1 million to $50 million), and large enterprise (greater than $50 million). No individual customer represented more than 5% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.  
 International presence
 We serve customers in approximately 155 countries. Our platform enables businesses to create stores in the consumer-facing language and currency of their choice. For the administrative control panel used by our customers to create and manage their stores, we currently allow our customers to select among a range of languages, including English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Italian, and Ukrainian. We plan to add additional languages throughout 2021.
 We maintain our headquarters in Austin, Texas, and approximately 85% of our employees are located in the United States, as of December 31, 2020. We were originally founded in Sydney, Australia. In 2019, we expanded the size of the Sydney sales and marketing team, established our first presence in Asia, and hired our first regional vice president and general manager of APAC, driving a 38% and 28% APAC revenue growth in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Before opening our first European office in London in July 2018, we had already acquired several thousand customers in Europe. The London office, along with the cost-effective scaling of our product and engineering talent in Kyiv, Ukraine, resulted in accelerating EMEA revenue growth of 68% and 20% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our platform continues to enable customers to self-serve globally, including in regions in which we lack a local business presence, such as Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive. We believe we can compete on the principal competitive factors in our market.
 In the mid-market and large enterprise segments, our primary competitors are Magento (an Adobe company), Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly known as Demandware), and Shopify Plus. In the SMB segment, our primary competitors are Shopify and WooCommerce. BuiltWith has identified more than 500 platforms of various sizes around the world. 
 Intellectual property
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright, patent, and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on contractual arrangements, such as license, assignment, and confidentiality agreements, and technical measures.
 We have two issued patents in the United States, which expire February 10, 2035 and March 20, 2036, respectively. We have been issued federal registrations for trademarks, including “BigCommerce,” related stylized marks, and “Make It Big,” and have multiple pending trademark applications. We hold domestic and international domain names that include “BigCommerce” and similar variations.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 813 full-time employees, including 190 in research and development, 231 in sales and marketing, and 392 in general and administrative, professional services, and customer support. Of these employees, 691 are in the United States and 122 are in our international locations. We consider our culture and employees to be vital to our success. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. We are highly dependent on our management, highly-skilled software engineers, and sales personnel, and it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain valuable employees. To facilitate attraction and retention, we strive to make BigCommerce a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits programs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 A portion of our services are provided using Ukrainian development specialists. These Ukrainian development specialists, who provide services on our behalf, are registered as “private entrepreneurs” with the tax authorities of Ukraine and operate as independent contractors.
 Culture and values
 Our culture is built on our corporate values: Customers First, Team on a Mission, Think Big, Act with Integrity, and Make a Difference Every Day. Together our values and caring culture create an atmosphere that enables us to successfully recruit and retain talented and passionate team

members. Our team members are our “secret sauce.” Their dedication, talent, and spirit create a virtuous cycle of service, product excellence, and customer satisfaction.
 We have frequently won “best places to work” public recognition across our largest work centers of Austin, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Sydney, Australia. 
 Our mission is to power global ecommerce success by delivering the industry’s best and most versatile multi-tenant SaaS platform. This mission inspires our employees, who join BigCommerce to accomplish great things for our customers, partners and each other. We, in turn, commit to helping our employees thrive in an environment that is fun, fast-paced, and challenging.
 Facilities
 Our worldwide corporate headquarters is located in Austin, Texas. It covers 70,682 square feet pursuant to an operating lease that expires in 2028. We also have office locations in London, San Francisco, and Sydney, Australia. We believe our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. We intend to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations.
 Regulatory considerations
 The legal environment of internet-based businesses, both in the United States and internationally, is evolving rapidly and is often unclear. For example, we occasionally cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business. This ambiguity includes topics such as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—Evolving global internet laws, regulations and standards, privacy regulations, cross-border data transfer restrictions, and data localization requirements, may limit the use and adoption of our services, expose us to liability, or otherwise adversely affect our business.”
 Legal proceedings
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
