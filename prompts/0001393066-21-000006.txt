Products
We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, and paper. As of the second quarter of 2020, the results from our newsprint and specialty papers operations have been combined to form the paper reportable segment. This better reflects management’s internal analysis, given the diminishing percentage newsprint and specialty papers represent in our product portfolio.
Market pulp
We produce market pulp at five facilities in North America, with total capacity of 1.3 million metric tons, or 8% of total North American capacity. Our market pulp includes virgin pulp and recycled bleached kraft (or, “RBK”) pulp, for which we are a leading global producer. Approximately 80% of our virgin pulp capacity is softwood-based: northern bleached softwood kraft (or, “NBSK”) pulp, southern bleached softwood kraft (or, “SBSK”) pulp, and fluff pulp. The remainder of our virgin pulp capacity consists of northern bleached hardwood kraft (or, “NBHK”) pulp and southern bleached hardwood kraft (or, “SBHK”) pulp. Pulp not converted into paper or tissue is sold as market pulp, which is used to make a range of consumer products including tissue, packaging, specialty paper products, diapers, and other absorbent products. 23% of our 2020 market pulp shipments were exported outside of North America, including significant exports to Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Tissue
We produce tissue products at three facilities in North America. With total capacity of 128,000 short tons (116,000 metric tons), we are a fully integrated manufacturer operating four tissue machines and 13 converting lines, including the converting facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, that we acquired in December 2020. We manufacture a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and retail markets, including recycled and virgin paper products, covering premium, value, and economy grades. We also sell parent rolls not converted into tissue products.
Wood products
We own 14 sawmills in Canada that produce construction-grade lumber sold in North America. On February 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of three sawmills in the U.S. South, bringing our number of sawmills to 17. The three sawmills have a combined production capacity of 550 million board feet once ramped-up. For more information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisition,” to our consolidated financial statements and related notes (or, “Consolidated Financial Statements”) appearing in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10-K.
Our Canadian sawmills produce dimension spruce-pine-fir lumber and provide wood chips to our pulp and paper mills in Canada. Our sawmills also supply wood residue to our other segments, to be used as fuel to produce electricity and steam based on renewable sources. Our U.S. sawmills produce dimension lumber and decking from southern yellow pine. In 2020, we shipped 1.9 billion board feet of construction-grade lumber and decking. We also operate two remanufactured wood products facilities that manufacture bed frame components, finger joints, and furring strips, two engineered wood products facilities that manufacture I-joists for the construction industry, and one wood pellet facility, all of which are located in Quebec and Ontario.

Paper
We produce a wide range of papers at 10 mills strategically located to serve major markets, with total capacity of 2.1 million metric tons. We are a leading global producer of newsprint and the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America.
We own six newsprint facilities in North America, with total capacity of 1.4 million metric tons, which represents 9% of total worldwide capacity and 44% of total North American capacity. We sell newsprint to newspaper publishers worldwide and also to commercial printers in North America for uses such as inserts and flyers. In 2020, North American deliveries represented 65% of our total newsprint shipments.
We produce specialty papers at four facilities in North America. With total capacity of 0.7 million metric tons, our specialty papers comprise uncoated mechanical papers, including supercalendered paper and white paper, as well as uncoated freesheet papers. With 26% of total North American capacity, we are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America, and the fourth largest in the world. Our specialty papers are used in books, retail inserts, direct mail, coupons, magazines, catalogs, bags and other commercial printing applications. We sell specialty papers to major commercial printers, direct mailers, publishers, catalogers and retailers, mostly in North America.
For information on our corporate strategy, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Our Business” of this Form 10-K.

each entity. We operate the facilities and our joint venture partner sells the products. The amounts in the above table represent the mills’ total capacity and production.
Other products
We sell green power produced from renewable sources and wood-related products to customers located in Canada and the U.S. Sales of these other products are considered a recovery of the cost of manufacturing our primary products.
We also have a 49% interest in Serres Toundra Inc., a joint venture that produces vegetables from 19 hectares of greenhouses adjacent to our Saint-Félicien pulp mill. The greenhouses source a portion of their heat from our Saint-Félicien pulp mill and are also expected to source a portion of their CO2 requirements from such mill by the end of 2021.
Raw Materials
In the manufacture of our paper, tissue, pulp, and wood products, our operations consume substantial amounts of raw materials such as wood and chemicals, as well as energy. We purchase raw materials and energy sources (to complement internal generation) primarily on the open market. These raw materials are market-priced commodities and as such, are subject to fluctuations in market prices. For additional information about commodity price risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk” of this Form 10‑K.
Wood
Our sources of wood include purchases from local producers, including sawmills that supply residual wood chips, wood harvested from government-owned land on which we hold timber supply guarantees or harvesting rights, and property we own or lease. In Quebec, under the Sustainable Forest Development Act, volumes are allocated through timber supply guarantees, which are five years in length and renewable, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2020, we were allocated 4.5 million cubic meters of supply through the timber supply guarantees. In Ontario, we had long-term harvesting rights for 11.5 million acres of government-owned land, as of December 31, 2020. The harvesting rights licenses in Ontario are 20 years in length and automatically renew every five years, contingent upon our continued compliance with environmental performance and reforestation requirements.
We depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. The volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, which are generally referred to as the annual allowable cut (or, the “AAC”). The AAC is reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. The next AAC revision in Quebec is scheduled to take place in 2023 while Ontario is completing AAC revisions in 2021 for the forests in which we operate. About 25% of the total allowable harvesting rights in Quebec are allocated through an open auction system. The prices generated by the auction system are used to set pricing for the remainder of the AAC. The timber requirements for our U.S. sawmills are met mostly by purchasing timber from timberland owners.
In addition to the forest management regulations that we must abide with, we have sought out independent certification for 100% of the forests that we manage or on which we hold significant harvesting rights in order to demonstrate our strong belief that it is possible to operate successfully with sustainable harvesting practices while maintaining biodiversity and protecting the forest, values important to a range of stakeholders. The woodlands that we manage are all independently certified to at least one internationally recognized forest management standard: Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (or, “SFI®”) and Forest Stewardship Council® (or, “FSC®”). In 2020, we successfully maintained SFI forest management certifications for all of our managed woodlands in Quebec and Ontario. We also continued to maintain the FSC forest management certificates that we held in Quebec and Ontario. In addition, we continue to be one of the largest holders of SFI and FSC forest management certificates in North America.
We have also instituted fiber-tracking systems at all of our North American facilities to ensure that our wood fiber supply comes from acceptable sources such as certified forests and legal harvesting operations, with the exception of our three recently acquired sawmills in the U.S. South, which are expected to have their fiber-tracking systems certified in 2021. These systems are third-party certified according to one or more of three internationally recognized chain of custody standards, namely SFI, FSC, and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (or, “PEFC”). 100% of our wood and fiber sources are procured through the FSC Controlled Wood standard, the FSC chain of custody certification, the PEFC due diligence requirements, or the SFI fiber sourcing requirements, and in some cases a combination of these standards.
We strive to improve our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices and we encourage our wood and fiber suppliers to demonstrate continual improvement in forest resource management, wood and fiber procurement, and third-party certification.

Chemicals
We use various chemicals in our pulp, tissue, and paper manufacturing operations including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, liquid sodium hydrosulfite, and sulfuric acid.
Energy
Steam and electrical power constitute the primary forms of energy used in pulp, tissue, and paper production. Process steam is produced in boilers using a variety of fuel sources, as well as heat recovery units in mechanical pulp facilities. All of our pulp, paper and tissue operating sites generate 100% of their own steam requirements. In 2020, the Alma, Calhoun, Coosa Pines, Dolbeau, Gatineau, Kénogami, Saint-Félicien and Thunder Bay operations collectively consumed 61% of their electrical requirements from internal sources, notably on-site cogeneration and hydroelectric dams. We purchased the balance of our electrical energy needs from third parties. We have six sites that operate cogeneration facilities and all of these sites generate primarily green energy from renewable biomass.
We also have one hydroelectric generation and transmission network (Hydro-Saguenay in the Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec), which consists of seven generating stations with 170 MW of capacity. The water rights agreements required to operate some of these facilities typically range from 10 to 50 years and, subject to certain conditions, some are renewable for additional terms. In some cases, the agreements are contingent on the continued operation of the related paper mills and a minimum level of capital spending in the region. For the other facilities, the right to generate hydroelectricity stems from our ownership of the riverbed on which these facilities are located.
Competition
In general, our products, other than tissue, are globally-traded commodities. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and, aside from quality specifications to meet customer needs, including designations to globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards, the production of our products does not depend upon a proprietary process or formula. Pricing and the level of shipments of our products are influenced by the balance between supply and demand as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Prices for our products have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile.
We produce six major grades of market pulp (NBSK, SBSK, NBHK, SBHK, RBK, and fluff), for which we compete with a number of major market pulp producers, primarily with operations in North America. Market pulp being a globally-traded commodity, we also compete with other producers from South America (eucalyptus hardwood and radiata pine softwood), Europe (northern hardwood and softwood), and Asia (mixed tropical hardwood). Price, quality, service, and fiber sources are considered the main competitive determinants.
We are an integrated manufacturer of tissue products and compete with several major competitors in the North American tissue market. The key competitive attributes in this market include price, product quality, service, and customer relationships. Competition is also significantly affected by geographic location, as freight costs represent a material portion of the costs. We compete with branded and private-label products within North America.
We compete in North America with both large North American and numerous smaller local lumber producers in a highly competitive market. We also compete with European producers in the North American market during periods of favorable currencies and prices. Because there are few distinctions between lumber from different producers, competition is primarily based on price. Competition is also affected by cost and availability of wood, freight cost, and labor. We have been required to pay cash deposits for estimated countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, since April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the rates for such estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties were 19.10% and 1.15%, respectively. During any period in which our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products from our Canadian sawmills are subject to countervailing duty or anti-dumping cash deposit requirements or duty requirements, our competitive position could be materially affected. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risks – We are subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, which could materially affect our operations and cash flows,” of this Form 10‑K.
In 2020, the five largest North American newsprint producers represented 88% of North American capacity, and the five largest global producers represented 32% of global newsprint capacity. We face competition from both large global producers and numerous smaller regional producers. Price, quality, and customer relationships are important competitive determinants.
Our uncoated mechanical and uncoated freesheet papers compete on the basis of price, quality, service, and range of product line. We compete with numerous uncoated mechanical paper producers, with the five largest North American producers 
 8


Table of Contents

representing 89% of the North American uncoated mechanical papers capacity, and the five largest global producers representing 54% of global uncoated mechanical papers capacity in 2020. In addition, imports from overseas accounted for 9% of North American uncoated mechanical paper demand in 2020. There are also numerous worldwide suppliers of other grades of paper such as coated mechanical papers and coated freesheet.
As with other global commodities, the competitive position of our products is significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,” of this Form 10-K.
Trends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Strategic Risks – Developments in non-print media and changes in consumer habits regarding the use of paper are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our key products,” of this Form 10-K.
Based on market interest, we offer a number of our products with specific designations to one or more globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and the existence of territorial disputes between Indigenous peoples and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, or to meet commitments to supply certified product, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 7,100 people, of whom approximately 3,700 were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the Confederation of National Trade Unions (or, the “CNTU”) in Canada, and predominantly by the United Steelworkers International (or, the “USW”) in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, covering approximately 500 employees in Canada. Collective agreements covering approximately 300 employees in Canada have expired, involving certain Canadian sawmills.
While we intend to renew collective agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew agreements on satisfactory terms, or that we will maintain continuously satisfactory agreements with all of our unionized employees. Should we be unable to do so, it could result in strikes, work stoppages, or disturbances by affected employees, which could cause us to experience a disruption of operations and affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Our long-term competitiveness is tied to the ability to recruit, develop and retain top-quality employees with the right skills. We are building a strong corporate culture that attracts results-driven and action-oriented employees and allows natural leaders to grow. We hired 970 new permanent and temporary employees, raising our employer profile through targeted recruitment practices. We assessed 100% of salaried employees’ effectiveness through the Demonstrated Effectiveness Appraisal process, which is focused on enhancing organizational capability through managerial accountability and people development. We continue to train every employee on Resolute’s Code of Business Conduct and have in place a Diversity Policy designed to ensure equal consideration and opportunities to all employees. We are equally committed to ensuring that our employees are consistently motivated and engaged by promoting individual professional development goals, support sharing of knowledge and resources across the Company, and create opportunities for growth and learning wherever possible.
The health and safety of our employees is a core Company value. We are committed to providing our employees with safe working environments, in addition to complying with applicable legal requirements at all our sites. Since 2015, our Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) incident rate world-class performance has been below 0.80, and we achieved an OSHA incident rate of 0.62 in 2020, which is one of the lowest rates within the North American forestry products industry.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vigilance committee has been set up to collect and analyze continuous relevant information through the appropriate public health authorities where we operate, and more than 30 pandemic crisis management protocols have been implemented to ensure the safety and health of employees and contractors working at all our sites, helping to mitigate disruptions of operations.
In addition, the board adopted a board-level diversity policy striving to maintain a minimum of 25% representation each of men and women on our board of directors, as well as an executive leadership-level diversity policy acknowledging diversity as a key factor in the Company’s talent management strategy. Currently there are two women on the board representing 29% of its membership.

We are subject to a number of federal or national, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions relating to the environment, health and safety, and some of our infrastructure, including dams and bridges. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental, health and safety, as well as applicable infrastructure laws and regulations. While it is impossible to predict future laws and regulations that may be adopted, we believe that we will not be at a significant competitive disadvantage with regard to meeting future Canadian or U.S. standards. For additional information, see Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies – Environmental matters,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Internet Availability of Information
We make our Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, available free of charge on our website (www.resolutefp.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish such materials to the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains our reports and other information filed with the SEC. Our reports are also available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval website (www.sedar.com).
