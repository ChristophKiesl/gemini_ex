Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic™ medicines. Synthetic Biotic medicines are generated from Synlogic’s proprietary drug discovery and development platform, using Synthetic Biology and leveraging a reproducible, modular approach to develop beneficial microbes that perform or deliver critical therapeutic functions. Synthetic Biotic medicines are designed to metabolize a toxic substance, compensate for missing or damaged metabolic pathways, or deliver combinations of therapeutic factors. Our goal is to discover, develop, and ultimately commercialize Synthetic Biotic medicines. Synlogic’s proprietary pipeline includes Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of metabolic disorders including Phenylketonuria (PKU) and Enteric Hyperoxaluria. We are also building a portfolio of partner-able assets in immunology and oncology. 
 We are supported by our Board of Directors and our scientific advisory board, each of which offers complementary experience in drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies, management, and business development. Our founding science came from the laboratories of Professors James Collins and Timothy Lu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who remain highly engaged in guiding development and application of our platform.
 Product Pipeline: Metabolic Disease
 Phenylketonuria
 Our most advanced product candidate is SYNB1618, an oral therapy intended for the treatment of PKU, a rare metabolic disease in which an amino acid known as phenylalanine (Phe) accumulates in the body as a result of genetic defects. Elevated levels of Phe are toxic to the brain and can lead to neurological dysfunction. SYNB1618 is designed to function in the gut of patients to reduce excess Phe, with the goal of lowering levels in the blood and other tissues. SYNB1618 has received both Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation for PKU from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with SYNB1618 in the third quarter of 2020. The Phase 2 trial, referred to as the SynPheny-1 Study, is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a solid formulation of SYNB1618 as well as its potential to lower blood Phe levels in adult PKU patients. The SynPheny-1 Study is designed to be flexible, with subjects physically coming to the clinic or participating from the patient's home utilizing home healthcare services. 
 We completed a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of an early liquid formulation of SYNB1618 and announced top-line data from healthy volunteers evaluated in this study in September 2018. In July 2019, we announced data that demonstrated that SYNB1618 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved proof-of-mechanism of strain activity in both healthy volunteers and patients with PKU. Following the study using the liquid formulation, we developed a lyophilized formulation of SYNB1618. We have evaluated this lyophilized formulation in a bridging study in healthy volunteers. The study of this more patient- and commercialization-appropriate presentation of SYNB1618 demonstrated activity and improved tolerability over the early liquid formulation. 
 SYNB1618 is a member of a family of SYNB strains that consume Phe. We have additional Phe consuming strains for PKU in preclinical development, including SYNB1934.
 Enteric Hyperoxaluria
 Enteric Hyperoxaluria is an acquired metabolic disorder. Enteric Hyperoxaluria is caused by increased absorption of dietary oxalate, which is present in many healthy foods such as leafy greens, nuts, and chocolate, making it difficult to control with dietary interventions. Enteric hyperoxaluria often occurs as a result of a primary insult to the bowel, such as inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, or surgical procedures such as Roux-en-Y bariatric weight-loss surgery. The disorder may cause dangerously high levels of urinary oxalate and progressive kidney damage, kidney stone formation, and nephrocalcinosis. There are no approved treatments.
 In May 2020, we announced the nomination of a clinical candidate for Enteric Hyperoxaluria, SYNB8802. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB8802 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This study will assess the safety, tolerability and kinetics of SYNB8802 as well as the effect SYNB8802 has on changes in plasma and urine biomarkers of strain activity, and the potential to reduce urinary oxalate. The study has two parts: Part A is a multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in whom we will induce temporary hyperoxaluria via diet; Part B is a placebo controlled, cross-over design study in patients with Enteric Hyperoxaluria following Roux-n-Y gastric bypass surgery.

Other Metabolic Programs
 We are advancing a portfolio of investigational Synthetic Biotic medicines for rare, niche, and common metabolic disorders which, similar to PKU and enteric hyperoxaluria, have a toxic metabolite found in the GI tract. We will disclose additional details on such programs as they move through preclinical development.
 Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited, rare metabolic disease characterized by a deficiency of enzymes required to break down certain amino acids. We have been conducting studies to advance a pre-clinical candidate for MSUD.  Prototype strains did not meet pre-specified criteria for candidate declaration. Therefore, we discontinued efforts in MSUD in the third quarter of 2020 to prioritize other metabolic disorders.
 Product Pipeline: Immunomodulation 
 Oncology
 We have also developed a portfolio of Synthetic Biotic medicines to treat certain cancers that are designed to modify the tumor microenvironment, activate the immune system and result in tumor reduction. These Synthetic Biotic medicines could be used in combination with other cancer therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our first Synthetic Biotic clinical immuno-oncology (IO) candidate is SYNB1891, an intratumorally administered Synthetic Biotic medicine engineered to act as a dual innate and adaptive immune activator. SYNB1891 has been designed to activate the immune response in tumors via the E.coli Nissle chassis and production of cyclic di-AMP, an activator of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes, also referred to as the STING pathway. The STING pathway plays a critical role in the initiation of an anti-tumor immune response. In January 2020, we treated the first subject in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1891 in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma.  The clinical trial is designed to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SYNB1891 delivered as a monotherapy.  Once an MTD is identified, we will evaluate treatment of patients with a combination of SYNB1891 and the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (Tecentriq), provided through a supply agreement with Roche. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Phase 1 clinical trial has remained open to both currently enrolled patients and for new patient enrollment. We released interim data from the ongoing monotherapy arm of this trial in December of 2020, which demonstrated target engagement and the production of biomarkers consistent with STING activation. In December of 2020, we also initiated the combination arm of the Phase 1 clinical trial. Additional data on this study may be shared at future medical meetings.
 ImmunologyWe also leverage our proprietary technology platform to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines to treat a broader range of human diseases. To achieve this goal, we collaborate with key disease experts who have developed robust models of relevant diseases and inform our translational medicine strategy. These collaborators bring complementary expertise in preclinical development, clinical development and commercialization. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an attractive target for our technology as Synthetic Biotic medicines can be designed to locally deliver combinations of complementary therapeutics to potentially address the unmet medical need for maintenance of disease remissions. In May 2020, we announced the termination of our collaboration with AbbVie S.à.r.l. (AbbVie) to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of types of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.  Upon termination, we regained all rights to develop these and new IBD Synthetic Biotic medicines for all effectors targeting IBD. This allows us to fully leverage our expertise in strain engineering, quantitative biology, regulatory, and manufacturing to expand our wholly owned GI-based program portfolio to include IBD. We further regained the rights to partner these IBD programs. We may enter into additional strategic partnerships in the future to maximize the value of our programs and our Synthetic Biotic platform.

Our pipeline of our programs is shown below. 



As we advance our lead programs, we continue to learn and improve our Synthetic Biotic platform, which will inform all future portfolio programs. Consequently, we believe we have a robust engine for building a sustainable pipeline of novel, Synthetic Biotic medicines across a range of diseases. Through the strength of our internal team and network of partners, we believe we can deliver on the promise of Synthetic Biotic medicines to improve the lives of patients with significant unmet medical needs. 
 Our Strategy 
 To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following key strategies: 
 Advance an internal portfolio of investigational Synthetic Biotic medicines that address rare or niche metabolic diseases by metabolizing toxic substances in the GI tract. 
 Advance Clinical Development of SYNB1618 for PKU. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with SYNB1618 in the third quarter of 2020.  The Phase 2 trial, referred to as the SynPheny-1 Study, is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a solid formulation of SYNB1618 as well as its potential to lower blood Phe levels in adult PKU patients. 
 We completed a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of an early liquid formulation of SYNB1618 and announced top-line data from healthy volunteers evaluated in this study in September 2018. In July 2019, we announced data that demonstrated that SYNB1618 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved proof-of-mechanism of strain activity in both healthy volunteers and patients with PKU. In September 2019, we presented data from a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that demonstrated that an early liquid formulation of SYNB1618 was safe in healthy volunteers and patients with PKU and achieved proof-of-mechanism demonstrating that SYNB1618 is consuming Phe in the GI tract. In the second half of 2019, we initiated a bridging study in healthy volunteers to evaluate a new solid lyophilized formulation which provides a more commercially appropriate presentation of SYNB1618. The bridging study demonstrated improved tolerability of the lyophilized SYNB1618 over the early liquid formulation and enabled us to determine an MTD to take forward to test in patients.  
 Advance Clinical Development of SYNB8802 for Enteric Hyperoxaluria. In May 2020, we announced the nomination of a clinical candidate for Enteric Hyperoxaluria, SYNB8802. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB8802 in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 SYNB8802 will be assessed for safety and tolerability, strain kinetics, changes in plasma and urine biomarkers of strain activity, and the potential to reduce urinary oxalate in the Phase 1 clinical study. The study has two parts: Part A is a multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in whom we will induce temporary hyperoxaluria via diet; Part B is a placebo controlled, cross-over design study in patients with Enteric Hyperoxaluria following Roux-n-Y gastric bypass surgery.

Create a portfolio of investigational Synthetic Biotic medicines that modulate the immune system, which we can then partner with third parties for further development. 
 Advance Clinical Development of our First Immuno-Oncology program, SYNB1891. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of our first IO program, SYNB1891, in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma and in January 2020 announced that we had treated the first subject. The first arm of the study is designed to evaluate SYNB1891 as a monotherapy and to establish an MTD which will inform dosing in the second arm in which SYNB1891 will be evaluated in combination with atezolizumab. We released interim data from the ongoing monotherapy arm of this trial in December of 2020 that demonstrated target engagement and the production of biomarkers consistent with STING activation. In December of 2020 we also initiated the combination arm of the Phase 1 clinical trial.
 Maximize the Value of the Synthetic Biotic Platform by Leveraging Strategic Collaborations. We expect to continue to explore strategic partnerships that would leverage the complementary capabilities of our partners to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines and maximize the value of our Synthetic Biotic platform.
 
Expand our Synthetic Biotic platform capabilities including expertise in synthetic biology, microbial and disease biology, process development and manufacturing, clinical and regulatory development.
 
Support Clinical Pipeline Progress with Expanded Manufacturing and Formulation Capability. We have established internal manufacturing capabilities to produce both liquid and solid oral formulations of clinical trial material for mid-stage studies through entry into an agreement to lease good manufacturing practice (GMP) clean-room space in Waltham, Massachusetts. The clean-room facility provides an affordable and flexible option that maximizes control over our processes and timelines enabling us to move efficiently through clinical development. We continue to evaluate additional formulation and presentation options for later stage clinical studies and eventual commercialization of our Synthetic Biotic medicines.
 Enhance our Synthetic Biotic Platform Capabilities to Expand our Pipeline of Synthetic Biotic Medicines. As a leader in the development of engineered non-pathogenic bacteria for therapeutic use, we intend to advance the field of Synthetic Biotic medicines by continuing to innovate and broaden the potential of our platform to deliver clinically meaningful benefits for patients. We intend to build on our expertise in design, optimization, and manufacturing to further develop the Synthetic Biotic platform as a reproducible and scalable engine for generating a pipeline of innovative product candidates that address a broad range of diseases. We established a technology collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc. (Ginkgo) to enable the rapid optimization of Synthetic Biotic candidates. We will collaborate with other groups as appropriate to further develop our platform capabilities.
 Protect and Leverage Our Intellectual Property Portfolio and Patents. We believe that we have a broad intellectual property portfolio that includes patents and patent applications relevant to the engineering, development, manufacturing and formulation of human therapeutic products based on synthetic biology and the metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic bacteria. We intend to continue to protect and leverage our intellectual property assets by maintenance and expansion of our worldwide portfolio of intellectual property, including the pursuit of composition of matter and other intellectual property focused on our Synthetic Biotic programs and our technology platform. 
Our Focus: Synthetic Biotic Medicines 
 Our novel, proprietary Synthetic Biotic discovery and development platform combines synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to re-design the genetic circuitry of beneficial non-pathogenic microbes. Synthetic Biotic medicines are designed to perform metabolic transformations to compensate for missing or defective pathways in a patient or to produce therapeutically beneficial molecules. Synthetic Biotic medicines have unique advantages as potential therapeutics. Engineered microbes can be programmed to carry out functions that cannot be performed by conventional drug treatments, such as small molecules or antibodies. A Synthetic Biotic medicine can function catalytically, since a single living cell can carry out multiple cycles of the intended therapeutic activity during its time in the patient.

Leveraging Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering of Non-Pathogenic Bacteria to Produce Synthetic Biotic Medicines 
 Non-Pathogenic Bacteria. Bacteria have been isolated from the human microbiota and widely used as supplements (probiotics) that are believed to provide health benefits. Bacteria have evolved over millions of years to adapt, survive, and actively metabolize to consume or produce metabolites in the human body. They are also amenable to genetic manipulation. To confer a therapeutic effect, we use basic biological properties of bacteria and the tools of synthetic biology to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines from non-pathogenic microbes, focusing initially on a single strain of the bacteria E. coli Nissle.
 Using Synthetic Biology to Generate Synthetic Biotic Medicines. Our scientists genetically engineer this non-pathogenic bacterium with “wiring” or biological circuits to direct cellular biological processes in a manner analogous to designing electrical circuits. The critical parts of an engineered Synthetic Biotic medicine include (1) the “chassis,” or non-pathogenic bacterium, (2) the effector module, which is a gene or pathway encoding the core biological activity that provides the therapeutic function, and (3) tunable switches to precisely determine the circumstances under which the effector module will be active, as well as the potency, performance and output of the effectors themselves. We aim to precisely and appropriately control the amount, location and activity of our Synthetic Biotic medicines to address specific diseases. 
Schematic of the Synthetic Biotic Platform Components: Chassis, Effector Module, Switch
 

(1) The Chassis: Our Synthetic Biotic platform starts with a well-characterized bacteria used as probiotic to serve as the chassis upon which we build our living medicines. Our initial programs use E.coli Nissle, which is one of many non-pathogenic strains isolated from the human microbiota. E. coli Nissle is non-colonizing and has been used as a probiotic bacterial supplement for many years to promote gut health.  Clinical studies have demonstrated that E.coli Nissle is rapidly cleared from most individuals with no significant safety issues (Clin. Transl. Sci. (2017) 00, 1—8). We also observed similar rates of clearance from subjects in our recent Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers (Sci. Transl. Med. 2019: Vol. 11, Issue 475, eaau7975). We believe E. coli Nissle’s widespread use as a probiotic is evidence of its utility as a safe background chassis to apply synthetic biology to confer a therapeutic benefit.  There are a number of additional features of E.coli Nissle organism that makes it an attractive chassis for our platform:
  
• | E. coli Nissle’s genetic and metabolic machinery are well understood and provide a robust cellular context into which genetic information can be introduced with high efficiency and little or no damage to the fitness of the bacterium.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The advanced nature of the synthetic biology toolkit available for E. coli Nissle enables rapid iterative design, assembly, and testing of prototype product candidates and remains unique among other bacterial and cellular engineering approaches.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E.coli is relatively easy to manufacture at large scale compared to other bacteria.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6



 
• | As a Gram-negative bacterium, with a protective outer wall, E.coli Nissle survives well in the human GI tract.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (2) Building the Effector Module or Circuit: Synthetic Biotic medicines have the advantage that they can be designed with multiple pathway components. We have developed proprietary integration systems to direct stable insertion of multiple genetic circuits and pathways into optimal chromosomal locations, or “landing pads,” of E.coli Nissle. This enables efficient and stable expression of multiple genes encoding enzymes and other proteins. These activities may be further improved for therapeutic effect when combined or when under the control of tunable switches that determine when the mechanisms should be activated. Our Synthetic Biotic platform allows us to engineer two types of mechanistic activities into our Synthetic Biotic medicines: 1) we can engineer Synthetic Biotics capable of metabolic transformations that can substitute or compensate for missing or defective pathways in a patient, and 2) we can engineer Synthetic Biotics to produce therapeutically beneficial molecules. The enzymatic pathways needed to produce or consume molecules are protected from the harsh GI environment by their location within the cell cytoplasm of E. coli Nissle, allowing them the potential to function throughout the GI tract.  We have leveraged proprietary tools, know-how and intellectual property to build multiple Synthetic Biotic lead strains that produce therapeutically relevant effects in pre-clinical experiments. Progression of these strains as product candidates in diseases with high unmet need is based on prioritizing those with feasible drug development paths in terms of availability of informative animal models and existence of biomarkers to guide efficient clinical development. 
 (3) Tunable Switches: We also design and engineer proprietary switches to mediate the activity of the new pathways we introduce into our Synthetic Biotic medicines, with the goal of controlling the engineered circuit or its therapeutic output. To optimize the fitness of a Synthetic Biotic strain, it is critical that the effector is activated only at the appropriate time and place. The switches are based on engineering DNA elements called “inducible promoters” that are designed to respond to disease states, specific environmental signals, or exogenously added inducing molecules. Our goal is to design and develop Synthetic Biotic medicines programmed with switches to produce therapeutic effects at precisely the right time and location such as the anaerobic environment of the gut, or in the context of local inflammation or other pathogenic factors. 
Advantages of Our Synthetic Biotic Drug Development Platform and Synthetic Biotic Living Medicines
 We believe our platform has the potential to provide safe and effective therapies for patients given several attributes of our Synthetic Biotic approach: 
 Synthetic Biotic Medicines Have Potential to Address Unmet Need with Mechanisms Not Possible with Other Modalities
  
• | Consuming Toxins: Unlike other therapeutic approaches, Synthetic Biotic medicines can be programmed with a unique mechanistic activity. In our initial internal metabolic programs, we are engineering Synthetic Biotic medicines with entire pathways designed to degrade or “consume” toxic metabolites. We believe using a consumption pathway is advantageous compared to gene, RNA or enzyme replacement therapies that are limited to targeting a single gene or protein defect and may require several unique drug products to address genetically heterogeneous patient populations. By compensating with an entire pathway delivered in bacteria Synthetic Biotic medicines may provide a safe, therapeutic solution to broader disease populations as a single engineered therapeutic. Our SYNB1618 program is designed to consume Phe and has been shown to do so in both PKU patients and healthy volunteers. Our SYNB8802 program is designed to consume oxalate. The experience and lessons learned from this program are being applied to our additional preclinical programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Production of Therapeutic Molecules: Synthetic Biotic medicines can also be programmed to produce beneficial molecules. SYNB1891, our first oncology candidate is engineered to produce a STING agonist that has the potential to activate the immune system within the tumor microenvironment towards anti-tumor activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combinations of Mechanisms: Many diseases with complex pathophysiology, require more than a single effector to achieve a clinical response. By incorporating multiple effectors or enzymes into a single strain, Synthetic Biotic medicines have the potential to more effectively address multifactorial disease biology. For example, Synthetic biotic medicines can be engineered with multiple enzymes which consume toxic metabolites more effectively than a single effector could otherwise provide. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetic Biotic Medicines Provide Local Therapeutic Delivery to Reduce Safety Risk
 We believe that when delivered locally, Synthetic Biotic medicines have the potential to avoid the risks of dose-limiting side effects often associated with systemic therapies, especially when combinations of systemic therapies are required. Our Synthetic Biotic programs for metabolic diseases are designed to be dosed orally, and act locally while transiting through the gut and, as a consequence, decrease toxic metabolite levels in the blood, thereby providing a systemic therapeutic benefit to the patient. This approach is well suited to regulate the amount of a metabolic byproduct in a patient’s body, particularly when there is unconstrained metabolite flux between the systemic circulation and the gut. Given the potential for chronic oral dosing, Synthetic Biotic medicines may have benefits in terms of dose prediction and reversibility of activity.

Synthetic Biotic Medicines are Rationally Designed to Achieve Predictable Drug-like Properties 
 We have demonstrated the ability to move a program from concept to clinical development in as little as three years for our lead programs. Features of our Synthetic Biotic platform enable a highly efficient drug discovery and development process and have the potential to advance product candidates more rapidly and efficiently than is typically possible with other novel or emerging modalities. These include: 

• | Single Strain as Safe Chassis. There are several benefits of employing a single, safe and well-characterized probiotic bacterium such as E. coli Nissle as the background chassis. First, because our lead programs are based on E. coli Nissle, experience can be leveraged broadly across the portfolio, further optimizing the efficiency and reproducibility of discovery, development and manufacturing efforts. Next, the non-colonizing nature of E. coli Nissle can be combined with engineering approaches to optimize safety in terms of impact on the patient and the environment. E. coli Nissle can be engineered to require a specific exogenous nutrient supplement for growth, which limits the ability to replicate in the human body and environment. By controlling replication, we can control the number of cells being administered to a patient, which limits patient-to-patient variability. Also, dependence on an essential nutritional supplement not available in the environment reduces biocontainment risk. Moreover, the risk of a Synthetic Biotic medicine to the environment is further limited given that it is disadvantaged in terms of fitness due to its modifications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Predictive Pharmacology and Biomarkers. Synthetic Biotic programs are designed to achieve a target activity, and the platform supports an iterative design-build-test cycle to improve performance for achieving this target. For example, Synthetic Biotic programs can be optimized by including multiple copies or regulated control of certain genes, by adding transporters for particular substrates or by optimizing enzymes for basic bacterial metabolism. These tools enable rational and iterative engineering cycles in the discovery phase.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biomarkers as indicators of mechanistic and clinical activity may also be engineered into Synthetic Biotic medicines from the beginning to drive optimization and decision-making. By assessing the activities of our Synthetic Biotic programs in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we can model activity in humans. As we progress through clinical studies, we expect our predictive pharmacology models will be further refined to inform dosing and development decisions for our additional programs. 
  
• | Stability and Manufacturing. Our lead Synthetic Biotic programs have advanced the platform by defining manufacturing processes that can be used for the entire portfolio. Our use of synthetic biology switches permits the precise control of engineered metabolic pathway activation. We use switches to suppress effector activity during manufacturing, enabling development of reproducible processes for generation of biomass and robust, cost-efficient scale up of product candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturing efforts have demonstrated reproducibility, yield and stability during small, medium and Phase 1 clinical-scale campaigns where we have developed and executed processes to manufacture 3,000 to 5,000 doses of active drug. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement to lease GMP clean-room space from the Azzur Group, LLC. The agreement has expanded our manufacturing capabilities to enable in-house manufacturing of liquid and solid formulations for mid-stage clinical trials of our orally administered and intratumorally administered Synthetic Biotic medicines. 
 Our Product Pipeline 
 Approach to Selection of Therapeutic Area
 We believe that our Synthetic Biotic platform has potential to address both metabolic and immune-mediated diseases and we are evaluating these medicines at different sites of action via different routes of administration, either orally or via injection. Our decision to focus initially on metabolic disease is based on the potential of the Synthetic Biotic platform to uniquely address conditions in which there is: (1) unmet medical need with (2) well understood biology that is (3) based on an imbalance of a metabolite that can be consumed by our strains and (4) where that metabolite is available within or originates from the gut lumen. Additional considerations include the availability of animal models, relevant biomarkers and feasible clinical development paths. Our initial clinical and pre-clinical programs have been focused on certain rare inherited or acquired metabolic diseases that share these characteristics. When delivered orally, our Synthetic Biotic medicines are designed to act from the gut to compensate for the dysfunctional metabolic pathway with the intended consequence of reducing systemic levels of the toxic metabolites. We believe that clinical success in these programs will enable us to demonstrate the potential of our oral Synthetic Biotic medicines to address metabolic dysfunction, while bringing meaningful change to lives of patients suffering from these debilitating conditions. Our lead therapeutic programs for metabolic disease are SYNB1618 being developed for the treatment of PKU and SYNB8802 being developed for the treatment of Enteric Hyperoxaluria.

We are leveraging our proprietary technology platform to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines to treat additional diseases, including metabolic diseases, inflammation and cancer. We have a clinical stage program in oncology that capitalizes on the natural immunostimulatory characteristic of our bacterial chassis, and we have used a rational approach to engineer the bacterium to produce specific effectors to stimulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. We have generated other strains that have been engineered to produce effectors designed to alter the tumor microenvironment potentially enabling us to select combinations of relevant mechanisms and treatments to address specific tumor types. 
 
Our Initial Programs: Overview of Metabolic Diseases
 There are a number of metabolic diseases characterized by a dysfunctional metabolic pathway that causes a toxic accumulation of a metabolite which results in deleterious health consequences. In a subset of these diseases, the toxic metabolite originates in the gut or is available in the gut. Our Synthetic Biotic medicines can be engineered to consume such metabolites with the intended consequence of reducing systemic levels for therapeutic benefit. Although in some cases diet modification can be beneficial, high unmet medical need remains as there are few current therapeutic treatments for these diseases.
Rare Metabolic Diseases
 Patients with rare metabolic diseases lack certain enzymes that are responsible for metabolizing commonly occurring byproducts of digestion. The absence of these enzymes is caused by either a genetic mutation characterized by a dysfunctional metabolic pathway including PKU or organ dysfunction, such as enteric hyperoxaluria. In patients with such diseases, byproducts can accumulate to toxic levels in the gut and systemically throughout the body to cause serious health consequences, including irreversible neurological dysfunction.
 While there are hundreds of conditions that fall into this class, individual disorders are considered orphan diseases, with each disease affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States and fewer than five per 10,000 people in the European Union. This includes amino acid metabolism disorders such as PKU. 
 SYNB1618 for PKU 
 PKU is an inherited metabolic disease caused by a genetic defect in the gene phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) leading to Phe accumulation in the blood and brain, where it is neurotoxic and can lead to neurological deficits and even death. Current disease management of PKU involves dietary protein restriction with the consumption of phenylalanine-free protein supplements. There are currently two approved medications for treatment of PKU:
  
• | Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), an oral medication that is indicated for a subgroup of patients who have some residual PAH activity and does not eliminate the need for ongoing dietary management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PalynziqTM (pegvaliase-pqpz), an injectable, pegylated, bacterial enzyme (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase or PAL) that metabolizes Phe and that is indicated for treatment of adult patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite recommendations supporting life-long control of Phe levels, compliance is challenging due to the highly restrictive nature of the diet, putting patients at risk for cognitive and psychiatric disease and supporting the need for novel treatment approaches. 
 Our Synthetic Biotic platform is well-suited to complement the missing enzyme function in PKU patients by providing alternative metabolic pathways to consume Phe. SYNB1618 is designed to remove excess Phe from the blood by transforming it into non-toxic metabolites. The FDA granted SYNB1618 orphan drug designation for PKU in October 2017 and Fast Track designation in April 2018. 
 Overview of PKU 
 Phe is an essential amino acid that enters the body primarily through dietary protein and can be toxic if not sufficiently broken down and eliminated. The metabolism of Phe by the liver is dependent on adequate function of the liver enzyme PAH and the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) necessary for its activity. When the PAH gene is mutated and/or the production of BH4 is blocked, Phe cannot be sufficiently broken down and accumulates to toxic levels (i.e., hyperphenylalaninemia), which can cause irreversible brain damage. PKU is an inherited metabolic disease that presents as a severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia.

The disease course of PKU typically involves worsening neurological function that begins in infancy or early childhood. The clinical manifestations vary depending on severity of the enzyme mutation, the time of diagnosis and treatment initiation, and compliance. Symptoms may be extensive, such as severe cognitive impairment, or they may reflect more moderate neurocognitive or physical issues, such as below average intelligence, behavioral or mood disorders, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, decreased motor function, eczema, body odor, and tremors or seizures. A woman with PKU who becomes pregnant could develop maternal PKU if her diet is not strictly controlled, and there is a risk that the baby will be born with one or more birth defects such as cognitive impairment, microcephaly or congenital heart disease. 
 Based on the success of newborn screening efforts that began in developed countries in the 1960s, it is believed that nearly all PKU patients under the age of 40 have been diagnosed at birth. The National PKU Alliance estimates that in the United States there are currently 16,500 people living with PKU and it is estimated that there are 50,000 patients worldwide.
 Currently, management of PKU requires a heavily modified diet that restricts protein intake, combined with essential amino acid and vitamin supplementation. Special medical foods, including phenylalanine-free protein formula, provide patients with dietary protein and fulfill other nutrient needs. However, it is challenging for most PKU patients to adhere to the restricted diet to the level that provides the necessary control of Phe levels even with the efforts of supportive family and social networks. Patients often have trouble adhering to the diet, with particular challenges arising during times of increasing independence during adolescence. Furthermore, access to low protein foods can be challenging, as they are costlier and less nutritious than their higher protein, non-modified counterparts. 
 Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) was the first drug approved for the treatment of PKU in 2007. It is indicated for the reduction of blood phenylalanine in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia with residual PAH activity as it is a synthetic form of the BH4 cofactor. Kuvan is to be used along with a Phe-restricted diet. Approximately 25-50% of PKU patients are responsive to oral (tablet or powder) administration of Kuvan.  However, Kuvan does not eliminate the need for ongoing dietary management in all patients. Large neutral amino acids have also demonstrated activity in blocking absorption of excess phenylalanine by the intestines and brain but are currently only administered in adolescents and adults. 
 PaylnziqTM (pegvaliase-pqpz) Injection, a pegylated form of recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), an enzyme that metabolizes phenylalanine but does not require cofactor activity, was approved by the FDA in 2018 for adult patients with PKU and uncontrolled blood phenylalanine. While daily Palynziq injections have been proven to lower phenylalanine levels, many patients experience injection site reactions and/or develop antibodies to the product. A Black Box warning of a risk of anaphylaxis is included on the Palynziq label and Palynziq is currently only indicated for adult patients. Other therapeutics in early development include various gene therapy approaches, modified cell therapies and a modified orally delivered enzyme replacement therapy.
 Despite recent improvements in PKU therapy, patients continue to suffer from poor outcomes. Even patients who are diagnosed and treated early have increased risk of neurocognitive abnormalities and psychiatric complications and are burdened by the life-long struggle to comply with strict dietary modifications. Available drug therapies demonstrate limited effectiveness, are accompanied by immunologic and other toxicities, and may still require patients to maintain a heavily restricted diet. We believe a truly transformative therapy would be orally dosed and provide sustained, safe concentrations of phenylalanine while enabling a normal or only moderately restricted diet. We believe that a Synthetic Biotic medicine could be an effective oral therapeutic that acts from the gut to consume excess Phe with the consequent effect of reducing levels in the blood without the need for severe Phe restriction or risk of systemic toxicities. 
 SYNB1618 Design 
 SYNB1618 is a strain of E. coli Nissle that we have engineered to express synthetic pathways for transporting and metabolizing Phe in patients with PKU following oral administration. SYNB1618 was designed to compensate for the missing enzyme function in patients with PKU with complementary pathways to reduce phenylalanine levels in the gut and, as a consequence, in the systemic circulation. 
 In designing SYNB1618, we integrated genes, including a form of the PAL enzyme that converts Phe to the non-toxic byproduct trans cinnamic acid (TCA), which is then converted in the liver to hippuric acid (HA) and excreted in the urine. TCA and HA function as useful biomarkers of SYNB1618 activity in vivo. SYNB1618 has also been engineered to express a second Phe-consuming pathway, L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD) that results in the production of another non-toxic product, phenylpyruvate (PP). A detailed description of the engineering of SYNB1618 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in September 2018 (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 857–864 (2018)).

SYNB1618 Preclinical Program 
 Preclinical Efficacy Studies 
 In vivo studies in a mouse model of PKU (enu2-/-) demonstrated that urinary HA concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion in SYNB1618-treated mice compared to mice treated with an unengineered E. coli Nissle control that did not have the phenylalanine degradation pathway. We also observed that subcutaneous injection of mice on a Phe-restricted diet with phenylalanine resulted in a rapid increase in blood phenylalanine concentrations. The increase associated with this phenylalanine challenge was significantly blunted upon oral administration of SYNB1618 compared to administration of the non-engineered control strain.  Similar data were generated with SYNB1618 in healthy non-human primates. With increasing oral doses of SYNB1618, we observed increasing levels of plasma TCA and urinary HA demonstrating that SYNB1618 is functional in the primate gut.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that SYNB1618 has activity in the GI tract and can decrease blood Phe levels by degradation of recirculating phenylalanine, as well as dietary Phe. A detailed description of the engineering of SYNB1618 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in September 2018 (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 857–864 (2018)). SYNB1618 Clinical Development Plan 
 In April 2018, we initiated a Phase 1/2a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and gastrointestinal clearance of an early liquid formulation of SYNB1618. We treated healthy adult volunteers with single- or multiple-ascending doses of SYNB1618 and, having identified an MTD, a small cohort of PKU patients were treated with SYNB1618 as a single dose and as multiple doses. 
 Primary endpoints of the study were safety, tolerability and identification of a suitable dose to evaluate in patients with PKU. In addition, exploratory endpoints were designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of SYNB1618, including production of previously identified biomarkers related to SYNB1618 activity, TCA in plasma and HA in urine, and to provide mechanistic and clinical insights in both healthy volunteers and patients with PKU. 
 Fifty-six healthy volunteers were dosed orally with either SYNB1618 or placebo (ratio three to one), including 24 in six cohorts in the SAD portion of the study and 32 subjects in three cohorts of the MAD portion of the trial. In September 2017, we announced top-line data demonstrating that in healthy volunteers SYNB1618 was safe and well tolerated at doses up to 2x1011 CFU three times a day for seven days. Higher doses were associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and vomiting. The data also demonstrated proof-of-mechanism for SYNB1618. 
 During the treatment part of the study, subjects were housed in a clinical unit and provided a defined diet. The activity of SYNB1618 was evaluated in fasted subjects in both the SAD and MAD cohorts after administration of a standardized breakfast drink containing a defined amount of protein. At one dose level in the SAD portion of the study, solid food containing an equivalent amount of protein was substituted for the liquid meal. In addition, a labeled Phe tracer (D5-Phe) was orally administered. Blood and urine were collected over a subsequent six-hour period and several metabolites were measured including Phe and SYNB1618-specific biomarkers of Phe metabolism, TCA in blood and HA in urine. This was conducted in the SAD cohorts on the day of dosing and in the MAD cohorts on Day -1 (baseline) and Day 7 (the last day of dosing).
 A statistically significant dose-dependent increase in both plasma TCA and urinary HA was observed in SYNB1618-treated subjects but not in those treated with placebo.  Production of metabolites from Phe administered as a free amino acid was similar to Phe administered as whole protein. In addition, production of metabolites was similar whether the protein was administered as a liquid or as a solid meal. In healthy volunteers, who all have normal Phe metabolism, there was no impact on blood Phe levels.  All healthy volunteers enrolled in the study cleared SYNB1618 from their GI tracts within the expected timeframe.
 In July 2019, we announced positive top-line clinical data from the patient cohorts of the Phase 1/2a study of the liquid formulation in which 14 subjects were treated with either SYNB1618 or placebo (3:1) with four treated with a single dose (7 x 1010) and 10 with multiple doses. The primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability of the early liquid formulation in patients. Exploratory outcomes were related to the assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of SYNB1618, including measurement of previously identified biomarkers, TCA and HA, related to SYNB1618’s engineered ability to consume Phe. A statistically significant increase in these biomarkers of SYNB1618 activity was observed in SYNB1618-treated subjects but not in those treated with placebo. 
 Based on the data from the Phase 1/2a study, which demonstrated that SYNB1618 was able to consume equivalent amounts of Phe in the GI-tract in both PKU patients and healthy volunteers, we studied a solid formulation of SYNB1618 in a bridging study in healthy volunteers. This study was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability and Phe-consuming activity, as determined by TCA and HA production, compared to the early liquid formulation. In December 2019, we announced that the solid formulation of SYNB1618 was better tolerated than the liquid and identified a maximum tolerated dose of 2 x 1012 live cells (5.3 x 1011 colony forming units, or CFUs).  The study further demonstrated that a dose ramp improved SYNB1618 tolerability, that the lyophilized strain maintained Phe-consuming activity, and that pH buffering was required for maximum activity of the strain.

SYNB1618 Upcoming Clinical Milestones 
 In the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with SYNB1618.  The Phase 2 trial, referred to as the SynPheny-1 Study, is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a solid formulation of SYNB1618 as well as its potential to lower blood Phe levels in adult PKU patients. 
Synthetic Biotic Program for Enteric Hyperoxaluria
 Overview of Enteric Hyperoxaluria
 Hyperoxaluria is a disease which results from excessive levels of oxalate in the body.  Oxalate can be found naturally in the body or in foods with high oxalate levels such as leafy greens, potatoes, almonds, coffee and beans.  Humans do not have an inherent physiological need for oxalate and it is normally excreted through the kidney or reabsorbed through the intestine.   Excessive levels of oxalate, when present in the urine, bind with calcium in the kidney and lead to nephrolithiasis (kidney stone formation), nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney complications and renal disease.
 There are two types of hyperoxaluria. Primary hyperoxaluria is a genetic condition wherein the body produces excessive levels of oxalate. Approved treatments for primary hyperoxaluria which address the genetic causes of primary hyperoxaluria are not beneficial to patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Enteric hyperoxaluria results from a gastrointestinal problem, which causes malabsorption of oxalate from the diet.   Conditions that commonly result in enteric hyperoxaluria include inflammatory bowel disease, certain kinds of bariatric surgery, short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease.  
 Patients with hyperoxaluria normally present to the healthcare system with kidney stones. There is a direct link between elevated urinary oxalate and increased probability of kidney stone events or other renal adverse outcomes in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Even modest reductions in urinary oxalate can reduced the odds of developing a kidney stone. A recent epidemiological study conducted in 297 patients with enteric hyperoxaluria demonstrated that a 20% reduction in urinary oxalate resulted in as much as a 25% reduction in risk of having a kidney stone in the subsequent year (D’Costa, Nephrol Dial Transplant 2020).
 Kidney stones, of which 80% have been found to contain oxalate crystals, are extremely painful and have an estimated economic burden of over ~$5 billion on the U.S. healthcare system. Patients with kidney stones are treated with opioids to control the pain and the stones are either passed naturally or treated with shockwave lithotripsy to break apart the stone or removal by surgery. There is a 60-80% recurrence rate after a patient has had one kidney stone.  Recurrent kidney stones have been shown to lead to kidney damage, end stage renal disease, and the need for a kidney transplant.  
 There are an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 patients with enteric hyperoxaluria in the United States, and more than 80,000 patients who experience recurrent kidney stones due to hyperoxaluria. Currently there are no approved pharmacological therapies for the reduction of oxalate levels in the urine in patients with Enteric Hyperoxaluria.  Existing treatment options are generally non-specific and include high fluid intake to increase urine output to more than two to three liters per day, a diet low in salt and oxalate, oral citrate and/or calcium and/or magnesium supplementation.
 We believe there exists a clear need for therapies that lower dangerously high levels of urinary oxalate in enteric hyperoxaluria patients. We believe that a targeted chronic oral therapy that results in lower urinary oxalate levels would provide a substantial benefit for this underserved patient population.

SYNB8802 Preclinical Program
 Preclinical Efficacy Studies 
 In vivo studies in both mouse and non-human primate studies demonstrated that SYNB8802 decreased urinary oxalate levels in an acute model of hyperoxaluria induced by dietary intervention in vivo. In mice, we observed reductions in C-13 labeled oxalate using both frozen liquid and lyophilized formulations of SYNB8802. In non-human primates whose oxalate was raised via dietary intervention, we observed statistically significant reductions of urinary oxalate levels, as well as statistically significant reductions in C-13 labeled oxalate, normalized by creatine levels.
 A detailed description of the engineering of SYNB8802 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2020 conference (Renaud et al, poster number PO0650). SYNB8802 Upcoming Clinical Milestones 
 In May 2020, we announced the nomination of a clinical candidate for Enteric Hyperoxaluria, SYNB8802. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB8802 in the fourth quarter of 2020.
 SYNB8802 will be assessed for safety and tolerability, strain kinetics, changes in plasma and urine biomarkers of strain activity, and the potential to reduce urinary oxalate in the Phase 1 clinical study. The study has two parts: Part A is a multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers in whom we will induce temporary hyperoxaluria via diet; Part B is a placebo controlled, cross-over design study in patients with Enteric Hyperoxaluria following Roux-n-Y gastric bypass surgery. 
Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Other Metabolic Disorders with High Unmet Need 
 The strain design and engineering, translational research, clinical and regulatory planning and scalable manufacturing of our PKU program has informed development of future clinical candidates, including the Enteric Hyperoxaluria program. Additional preclinical programs have been selected based on our expertise discovering and developing Synthetic Biotic medicines that consume a toxic metabolite known to be associated with the relevant clinical endpoint and to be accessible in the GI tract. 
Our Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Immuno-Oncology 
 We believe boosting the body’s immune response against tumor cells is one of the most promising advances in the treatment of cancer. The so-called “hot tumors,” those with robust immune cell infiltration, specifically by T cells, have responded well to immunotherapies such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking pathways that inhibit T cells thus enabling them to recognize and destroy the tumor. Checkpoint inhibitors have significantly extended the lives of patients with several cancer types and, in some cases, have resulted in complete clinical responses. However, a large proportion of tumors are “cold” (i.e., they lack T cells), and respond poorly to current immunotherapy. 
 Our goal is to leverage our Synthetic Biotic platform to design living medicines that can engage multiple immunomodulatory pathways to enhance tumor inflammation and promote robust T cell responses enabling broad tumor response and remission. We believe that such medicines have the potential to expand the patient population that could benefit from immunotherapy. Our initial approach is designed to deliver robust therapeutic combinations directly to the tumors, without significant systemic exposure. Synthetic Biotic medicines are also being developed to be administered by an intra-tumor injection or, in the case of GI cancers, by oral administration and can be engineered to perform three types of functions: metabolic consumption of an immune-suppressive metabolite, production of an immuno-activating metabolite, secretion or bacterial surface display of proteins (cytokines, chemokines, receptor ligands and single chain antibody domains, known as scFv). 
 13


We believe our Synthetic Biotic platform can be deployed in a rational, mechanistic way, and can deliver multiple validated mechanisms to elicit specific immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Lack of effective presentation of tumor-specific antigens to T cells is recognized as a significant limitation to the initiation of immune responses in tumors. Our lead clinical program in immuno-oncology (SYNB1891) is an approach to activate the immune system and enhance T cell priming, capitalizing on the innate stimulatory effect of the E.coli Nissle chassis and supplementing this with the directed delivery of an additional immune-stimulatory factor.  SYNB1891 is an engineered E.coli Nissle strain designed to produce, but not secrete, a STING agonist. The STING pathway plays a critical role in the control of tumor growth by initiating an antitumor immune response and driving tumor regression. SYNB1891 can be delivered directly into the tumor, where it is engulfed by antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling its localized site of action in the tumor microenvironment. The approach of using intratumoral injection elicits STING activation in the tumor, but not systemically, potentially decreasing the risk of adverse events that may arise from the production of systemic interferon. Moreover, as the STING agonist it produces is not secreted but is released directly into the APCs, immune cells such as T cells that might be negatively impacted by exposure are spared. 
 SYNB1891 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter, dose escalation trial in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoma. The study’s primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability of escalating doses of intratumorally administered SYNB1891 as a monotherapy. Once a maximum tolerated dose is established, patients will receive escalating dose levels of SYNB1891 in combination with the PD-L1-blocking checkpoint inhibitor, atezolizumab, (Tecentriq®) to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination regimen.  
 We released interim data from the ongoing monotherapy arm of this trial in December of 2020 which demonstrated target engagement and the production of biomarkers consistent with STING activation. In December of 2020 we also initiated the combination arm of the Phase 1 clinical trial.
 Our Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 
 IBD is a group of diseases characterized by significant local inflammation in the GI tract typically driven by T cells, activated macrophages and compromised function of the epithelial barrier. IBD pathogenesis is linked to both genetic and environmental factors and may be caused by altered interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system. Current approaches to treat IBD are focused on therapeutics that modulate the immune system and suppress inflammation. These therapies include steroids, such as prednisone, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, such as Humira® (adalimumab). However, these approaches are associated with systemic immunosuppression, which includes greater susceptibility to infectious diseases and cancer. According to the CDC, in 2015 an estimated 3.0 million adults in the United States are reported as being diagnosed with IBD. 
 Compromised gut barrier function also plays a central role in autoimmune diseases pathogenesis. A single layer of epithelial cells separates the luminal contents of the gut from the host circulatory system and the immune cells in the body. Disrupting the epithelial layer can lead to pathological exposure of foreign antigens from the lumen resulting in increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. The interplay between the gut microbiota and the host is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier as well as homeostatic immunity. Thus, enhancing barrier function and reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract are potential therapeutic mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. Our Synthetic Biotic platform allows for the effective programming of E. coli Nissle to execute these functions, including the metabolic production of factors such short chain fatty acids to enhance barrier function, and secreting proteins, such as immunomodulatory cytokines. 
 Among immune conditions, IBD is particularly attractive for our Synthetic Biotic platform, as it allows us to leverage knowledge and expertise gleaned from our oral metabolic programs to develop living medicines that can act locally at the site of disease in the gut. Because our approach is based on local delivery to the site of inflammation and not on systemic administration, we anticipate that our Synthetic Biotic medicines may offer an attractive safety profile in this setting. In 2015, we entered into a multi-year global collaboration with AbbVie focused on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. This agreement was terminated in 2020 and all rights for the development of Synthetic Biotics in IBD were returned to Synlogic.
 Collaboration Agreements 
 To accelerate the development and commercialization of Synthetic Biotic medicines to patients, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic alliances with collaborators that can expand our pipeline of therapeutic development and product candidates. We also work, and intend to seek additional opportunities to work, with multiple academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities to deepen our understanding and development of living medicines with the potential to treat disease and disorders.

Ginkgo Bioworks
 In June 2019 we entered into an agreement with Ginkgo. The agreement provided an $80.0 million equity investment at a premium in Synlogic by Ginkgo and entry into a long-term strategic platform collaboration to expand and accelerate the development of Synlogic’s pipeline of Synthetic Biotic medicines. We are using Ginkgo’s cell programming platform to build and test thousands of microbial strains to accelerate progression of early preclinical leads to drug candidates optimized for further clinical development. 
 As part of the agreement, Ginkgo purchased 6,340,771 shares of our common stock and accompanying Pre-Funded Warrants (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,548,117 shares of our common stock, at a combined price of $9.00 per share and Pre-Funded Warrant. Gross proceeds were approximately $80 million. Under the agreement, we made a prepayment to Ginkgo of $30.0 million for its foundry services that are being provided to us over an initial term of five years which can be extended. Upon the expiration of such initial term and, if applicable, such additional period, any portion of our prepayment that has not been used to purchase services from Ginkgo will be retained by Ginkgo. We have exclusive rights to any Synthetic Biotic medicines that we develop as part of the collaboration and to intellectual property covering such products. 
 AbbVie 
 In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with our subsidiary Synlogic IBDCo, Inc. (IBDCo) and an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AbbVie (together, the AbbVie Agreements) to collaborate on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. The AbbVie Agreements provided AbbVie with an exclusive option to acquire IBDCo, which would then have had an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize up to three specified Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. In May 2020, we announced the termination of this collaboration with AbbVie. Upon termination, we regained all rights to develop these and new IBD Synthetic Biotic medicines for all effectors targeting IBD. This allows us to fully leverage our expertise in strain engineering, quantitative biology, regulatory, and manufacturing to expand our wholly owned GI-based program portfolio to include IBD. We further regained the rights to partner these IBD programs.   Potential Future Collaborations 
 We believe strategic partnerships can be important drivers for accelerating our goal of developing Synthetic Biotic medicines, and we will continue to seek strategic alliances with collaborators who can help fund, develop and commercialize our novel therapeutic development and product candidates, particularly in large metabolic indications and immuno-oncology. As the potential application of our Synthetic Biotics platform is extremely broad, we also plan to continue to identify academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities that can contribute expertise and resources to our programs, to allow us to more rapidly expand our impact to broader patient populations. 
Intellectual Property and Technology Licenses
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of synthetic biology. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available, and plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We believe we are well positioned in terms of intellectual property because we: 
  
• | have built and expanded, and intend to continue expansion in, a broad worldwide portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and patent applications, in areas relevant to the development, manufacturing and formulation of human therapeutic products using live biotherapeutics based on synthetic biology; and

 We believe our intellectual property portfolio provides broad coverage of our Synthetic Biotic platform and applicable disease-related technologies, which are directed to diseases and conditions associated with hyperphenylalanemia, other rare metabolic diseases and metabolic disorders, autoimmune and other inflammatory disorders and oncology. As of March 18, 2021, we had 161 Synlogic-owned patents and patent applications in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, of which 17 have been issued or allowed.
 Synlogic Intellectual Property
 Disease-related applications
 The disease-related applications in our intellectual property portfolio relate to certain pathological conditions including, but not limited to hyperammonemia, hyperphenylalaninemia, certain inherited metabolic diseases and conditions, metabolic disorders, diseases and conditions associated with an inflammatory state, diseases associated with gut inflammation, compromised gut mucosal barrier (leaky gut), and various autoimmune disorders as well as use in immuno-oncology and provide coverage for engineered bacteria having genetic circuitry designed to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states. The intellectual property portfolio provides coverage for compositions directed to engineered bacterial strains, methods of making the bacterial strains and methods for treating diseases. Currently, intellectual property relating to this technology includes pending applications in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as several issued U.S. patents directed to composition of matter and pharmaceutical composition claims covering our clinical candidates. The patent term for our current IP has expiration dates ranging from December 2035 to January 2038, depending on the indication and excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
Platform Technology Applications
 In addition to the disease-related technology, our intellectual property portfolio also includes applications directed to platform technologies developed internally by us. Exemplary platform technologies include bacterial chassis-related and genetic circuitry-related technological developments, including, for example, improvements in inducible gene regulation, control of bacterial cell growth, including auto-regulation thereof, and systems for importing metabolites, as well as production of therapeutic effectors. These platform technologies, and our intellectual property coverage thereof, are broadly applicable to our therapeutic Synthetic Biotic medicines. 
General Considerations
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to account for delays in prosecution at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and/or to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. For regulatory delays, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of synthetic biology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. For additional risks, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”.

 Generally, we seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. In some circumstances, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology, trade secrets and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that company employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”. 
Regulatory Matters 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application (BLA), process before such products may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and implementing regulations. Our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as biologics. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of required preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before shipment of investigational product for human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials performed in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | development and approval of a companion diagnostic device, if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17



 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with GMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, animal toxicity and pharmacology studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. 
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. In June 2016, the FDA issued an updated guidance for the industry entitled “Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products: Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Information,” which included recommendations from the FDA regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND for early clinical trials with live biotherapeutic products. This Guidance reflects the FDA’s thinking on a topic at the time that it was issued and although it is not binding on the FDA or a sponsor, it provided us with additional information about what should be included in our IND. The sponsor will also include in the IND a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if a first phase study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational drug candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, and in accordance with GCP requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB rules and regulations. Study subjects must sign the IRB-approved informed consent form participating in a clinical trial.
 In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is usually conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Larger clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk: benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GMP or IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 
 During the development of a new biologic, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results with the FDA and to present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new biologic. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete the additional animal studies that may be required for approval and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing acceptable quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The annual report is customarily submitted in the form of a Drug Safety Update Report (DSUR) which is accepted as being equivalent to an IND Annual Report and also meets requirements of the EU (European Union) and ICH (International Conference on Harmonization).
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of most clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to submit the results of their clinical trials after completion, within a specified time frame. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial related information, and data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval will require disclosure. Failure to post results of clinical trials in a timely fashion is subject to daily fines and other potential penalties.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, stability, quality control and product release procedures, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of a significant user fee (for example, for FY2020 this application fee exceeds $2.9 million); although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including where the biologic has been designated as an orphan drug. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $300,000 per program. These fees are typically increased annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances (such as a waiver for the first human drug application submitted by a qualifying small business and exemptions for orphan products).
 19


Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA (for a standard review) and eight months from the date the BLA is submitted (for a “priority review”) because the FDA has approximately two months, or 60 days, after BLA submission to make a “filing” decision.
 The FDA reviews all BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
 The FDA may refer any BLA including applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. . After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. 
 BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an original BLA should occur within six months from the date that the BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be conditionally approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled Phase 4 clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the BLA, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial 
 20


promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most newly approved drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments). The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for, prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of its currently-owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States, and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits clinical pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application for the same biologic. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received or requested any FDA written requests. 
 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), which included the BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. A federal district court ruling in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety based on constitutionality last year, and in December 2019 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld lower court’s finding that the individual mandate I the law is unconstitutional. However, the Fifth Circuit also reversed and remanded the case to the district court to determine if other reforms enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance, including the BPCIA, could be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act so as not to be declared invalid. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals including potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will affect the implementation of that law and our business. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically-inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological 
 21


product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. 
 The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity, except in very limited circumstances. The FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusive approval if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to a previously approved drug, regardless of whether or not the approved drug was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. Thus orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 In October 2017, the FDA granted SYNB1618 orphan drug designation for the treatment of PKU. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing 
 22


a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA or BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA or for an NDA for a new molecular entity from the date of filing. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 In April 2018, the FDA granted Fast-Track designation for the use of SYNB1618 for the treatment of PKU.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 23


The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting biologics for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and finished product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are discovered after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.
 From time to time, new legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing the performance of clinical trials outside the U.S. and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. It is not yet clear how the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, now taking place on January 31, 2020, will affect the approval of medicinal products in the UK. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 European Union drug development, review and approval
 In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and it is anticipated to come into application in late 2020 or early 2021. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The 
 25


extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
 National authorization procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Conditional approval
 In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still 
 26


required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 Pediatric studies
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 European Union regulatory exclusivity
 In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
  
• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 27



PRIME designation
 The EMA grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. As part of the program, EMA provides early and enhanced dialogue and support to optimize the development of eligible medicines and speed up their evaluation, aiming to bring promising treatments to patients sooner. 
 Periods of authorization and renewals
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Rest of the world regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Our product candidates may not be considered cost effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. 
 28


Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B-covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price, which is regularly updated. We believe that our product candidates that are intended to be administered intratumorally will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules. 
 
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the ACA enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA has been under scrutiny by the U.S. Congress almost since its passage, and certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. As a result, its longevity continues to be uncertain. In addition, ongoing initiatives in the U.S. have increased and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing. The announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product candidate that we may successfully develop. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on our profitability placing the medicinal product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union and other countries do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states) can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
 If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include:

• | the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Health Care Reform in the US and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws
 The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 As previously mentioned, primary trend in the US health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The current Presidential administration and members of the US Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted in 2017, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. As noted above, a 2018 federal district court ruling struck down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety although the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently limited it to the individual mandate and remanded the case to the district court to determine if other reforms not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals including potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will affect the implementation of that law and our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act that affect health care expenditures. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny in recent years over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. Notably, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the “CREATES Act.” The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their 
 30


products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic and biosimilar product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic and biosimilar products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown.  
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services.
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. We contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. Our products are defined as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) or Genetically Modified Micro-organisms (GMM) and, dependent on their classification and containment, may be subject to regulation. 
 The United States does not have any federal legislation that is specific to genetically modified organisms.  GMOs are regulated pursuant to health, safety, and environmental legislation governing conventional products.  The U.S. approach to regulating GMOs is premised on the assumption that regulation should focus on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which they were produced.
 The clinical development and marketing of GMM within the European Union, and elsewhere, falls under different regulations and practices in each country, which may involve approval by environmental or other regulatory bodies, as well as health authorities, and may establish the requirement for a risk assessment for the testing or authorization of the product.
 Manufacturing 
 We have made and continue to make significant investments in our manufacturing organization, including process development and cGMP production infrastructure to establish manufacturing processes designed to support production of clinical trial material. The manufacturing processes are designed to enable us to reproducibly manufacture high quality living medicines at clinical scale and, later, at commercial scale to enable approval of our product candidates. We have built a fully integrated development and manufacturing organization with an internal process development group, quality group and manufacturing capabilities with the lease of cGMP cleanroom space in Waltham, Massachusetts. This facility enables us to produce clinical trial material for early to mid-stage studies of our rare metabolic disease and IO programs. We continue to build the organization to support scale-up and development towards commercialization. We currently expect to continue to work with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for production of late-stage clinical trial material. 
 Clinical trial material for our Phase 1 studies of SYNB1020 for hyperammonemia and SYNB1618 for PKU were manufactured by a CMO. These first clinical trials used a liquid formulation as the drug presentation. Since then we have made additional investment in our formulation development that now enables production of both liquid and solid dose formulations for our clinical programs. The solid oral formulation capability allows us to produce a more user-friendly presentation for later stage clinical development and future commercial use. We are continuing to invest and investigate the utility of additional presentations for solid formulations of our Synthetic Biotic medicines including capsules.
 To enable the production of high levels of cells, or biomass, we can engineer our Synthetic Biotic medicines with switches. These switches are comprised of transcription factor and promoter pairs that allow for controlled expression of the therapeutic effectors produced by our Synthetic Biotic medicines. To ensure the metabolic capacity of the cells is allotted to the production of a high level of biomass during manufacturing, the effector circuits in the Synthetic Biotic programs are not expressed during this growth phase. At the end of the manufacturing process, the circuits are then induced, or activated. This two-step approach was designed to enable a high level of biomass production as well as to deliver the required activity necessary at the time of administration. We continue to devote resources to process development and the generation of improved products.
 31


As we progress in clinical development, we will need to increase our scale and eventually to commercial-scale manufacturing. We are in the process of assessing CMOs who meet our criteria to supply our late-stage clinical development and commercial supply. We will compare the merits of working with one or more CMOs who meet our criteria with the possibility of building GMP manufacturing capacity and capabilities internally. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic bacteria, our clinical development expertise, and strong intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use synthetic biology or cell therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more conventional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in accessing technologies to enable our programs. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Competitors include other synthetic biology companies developing other synthetic biology methods, cellular and microbiome-based companies, DNA and RNA-based companies, as well as companies developing small molecules or other biologics. In the case of indications that we are targeting with our own Synthetic Biotic medicines, competitors include, but are not limited to:

 As of March 18, 2021, we had 72 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 60 were primarily engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
Corporate Information and History 
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2007 under the name “Mirna Therapeutics, Inc.” We carry on our business directly and through our subsidiaries. 
 Our subsidiary, Synlogic Operating Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware as TMC Therapeutics, Inc. on March 14, 2014. On July 15, 2014, TMC Therapeutics, Inc. changed its name to Synlogic, Inc. (Private Synlogic when referred to prior to the Merger (as defined below)). On July 2, 2015, the common and preferred shareholders of Private Synlogic executed the Synlogic, LLC Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which such common and preferred shareholders contributed such shareholders’ equity interests in Private Synlogic in exchange for common and preferred units in a newly formed parent company named Synlogic, LLC (the 2015 Reorganization). In addition, IBDCo was formed as a subsidiary of Synlogic, LLC, as part of the 2015 Reorganization, and we entered into a license, option and merger agreement with AbbVie for the development of treatments for IBD. 
 In May 2017, Private Synlogic completed a reorganization (“2017 Reorganization”) pursuant to which Synlogic, LLC merged with and into Private Synlogic, with Private Synlogic continuing as the surviving corporation. Pursuant to the 2017 Reorganization, the common units and preferred units of Synlogic, LLC, together consisting of Class A preferred units, contingently redeemable Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units, were exchanged for common stock and preferred stock of Private Synlogic, respectively. Additionally, Private Synlogic issued equity awards under the Synlogic 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”) to replace the canceled incentive units pursuant to the termination of the Synlogic, LLC 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 LLC Plan”).
 On August 28, 2017, Synlogic, Inc., formerly known as Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIRN) (“Mirna”), completed its business combination with Private Synlogic pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 15, 2017, by and among Mirna, Meerkat Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and Private Synlogic (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Synlogic, with Private Synlogic surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mirna (the “Merger”). On August 25, 2017, in connection with, and prior to the completion of the Merger, Mirna effected a reverse stock split of its common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and on August 28, 2017, immediately after completion of the Merger, Mirna changed its name to “Synlogic, Inc.” (NASDAQ: SYBX). 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Mirna issued shares of its common stock to Private Synlogic’s stockholders, using an exchange ratio, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, for each share of Private Synlogic common stock and preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (Exchange Ratio). In addition, Mirna assumed all of the stock options outstanding under the Synlogic 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (2017 Plan), with such stock options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Mirna’s common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Private Synlogic common stock previously represented by such options. Mirna also assumed the 2017 Plan.
