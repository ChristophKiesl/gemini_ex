Changes from Prior Periodic Reports
 In this report we have complied with the disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") release No. 33-10825 "Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105", and we have early adopted the changes in disclosure standards included in SEC release No. 33-10890 "Management's Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information."
Company Overview
 CalAmp Corp. (including its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, “CalAmp”, “the Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), incorporated in 1987, is a global connected intelligence company helping people and business work smarter. We partner with transportation and logistics, government, industrial equipment and automotive industries to track, monitor and recover vital assets with real-time visibility and insights that allow people and businesses everywhere to thrive. 
 We combine Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) applications, telematics services, our CalAmp Telematics Cloud™(“CTC”) platform and intelligent edge computing products to deliver a comprehensive view of vehicles, equipment, drivers, assets and cargo in real time. Our unified Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates actionable insights that help businesses make better decisions that reduce costs, increase revenue, maximize productivity, optimize operations and improve safety of their services and operations. While each one of our offerings can be combined for a complete end-to-end telematics solution, we also partner with our customers to develop custom solutions that integrate with back-office systems or custom software, without losing the actionable mobility data that only CalAmp can provide.
 Our CTC platform offers valuable telematics services that help companies more efficiently manage their vital assets including fleet video intelligence, remote asset tracking, real-time crash response and driver behavior scoring, among others. Our programmable telematics devices enable computing at the edge that captures business-critical data from mobile assets, their passengers and contents anywhere in the world at any time. We deliver connected intelligence that enables the efficient transport of life-saving pharmaceuticals, optimizes equipment utilization that builds our communities and infrastructure, provides greater public works visibility to citizens, and transports students safely to the classroom. 
 Economic conditions, competitive markets, global regulatory environments, the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to 4G-and-5G mobile connectivity are challenging traditional businesses to drive operational efficiencies, track processes, reduce costs, fund business growth and innovation, and enhance profitability and cash flow. Therefore, effective management of business spend is imperative if businesses are to consistently achieve profitable growth. Businesses must also evaluate their underutilized resources and leverage this new connected ecosystem to gather real-time data and analytics to drive greater efficiencies across the organization. CalAmp helps enterprises and mid- to large-sized businesses do this effectively so that they can compete in the on-demand economy and fulfill their customers’ expectations for fast and reliable on-time products and services.  
 Our company culture is driven by four core values:  
  
• | Customer Success – we are driven to establish, develop, and build strong relationships with our customers. We are focused on understanding their respective organizations and helping them meet and surpass their goals while facilitating the successful implementation of our services and our products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovation – we are committed to transforming ideas into new and improved products and processes. We respond resourcefully to demands and challenges in order to advance, compete and differentiate ourselves successfully in the marketplace and bring value to our customers as well as our teams.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Execution – we seek to understand, anticipate and respond to our customers’ needs by working hard to achieve measurable results. We achieve total customer satisfaction by understanding what the customer wants and delivering it flawlessly. Satisfied customers are essential to our success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inclusion – we believe in the integrity, honesty and trust of our employees. These are key ingredients to collaboration and inclusion. We listen to what others have to say, valuing their opinion, and speaking the truth in a positive manner. We take personal responsibility for our actions and are committed to building diverse teams with fairness and respect for all.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The successful execution of this approach, in combination with our core values, will help customers to succeed and thus drive our growth.
 We have approximately one million software and service subscribers today within our core businesses, and more than 20 million of our systems’ devices have been installed globally in multiple market verticals including automotive, insurance, transportation and logistics, government and industrial equipment. Our Here Comes The Bus® school bus tracking mobile app serves over 300 school districts across North America and has more than two million users. In April 2020, we made the strategic decision to transition out of the Automotive Vehicle Finance business and thus it is excluded from our core businesses. We believe our combined installed base represents a significant recurring revenue opportunity as we strive to deliver additional over-the-top services and data monetization opportunities to subscribers in collaboration with our customers and partners. 

Growth Strategy – Capitalize on $30B Total Available Market 

Over the past several years, we have been focused on growing our subscription-based business to deliver a higher level of recurring and predictable revenue stream. We intend to grow this core business and expand into new markets and geographic regions in the years ahead. Our business operates at the nexus of several large market opportunities, such as the fleet, transportation and logistics, supply chain and connected-vehicle ecosystems, which includes tracking monitoring and recovering high-value vehicles, equipment, cargo and other vital assets in the markets around the world. We believe these market opportunities constitute a total addressable market (“TAM”) of approximately $30 billion. In order to capitalize on this TAM, our growth strategy includes the following key elements:

• | Drive Ongoing Transformation to SaaS Business Model. We are relentlessly pursuing our goal to grow our software and subscription services business. To accomplish this goal, our team is focused on continual innovation across our proprietary software stack. We believe that by leveraging our existing brand 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2


 
presence and customer base in four market verticals, including transportation & logistics, industrial equipment, government, and connected car, we can drive growth in our SaaS applications. And as we steadily grow our base of SaaS subscribers, we’ll continue to migrate to a pure-play solution provider of subscription services by combining our broad portfolio of SaaS applications, proprietary cloud-based platform and programmable telematics systems devices.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase Subscriber Base to Drive Recurring Revenue. A key driver of our recurring revenue is the number of customers who are on a subscription basis for our software solutions and services. The more subscribers we are able to secure, the higher our recurring revenue will be. We currently have approximately 1.0 million subscribers within our core businesses, with significant opportunities to expand that number by transitioning existing customers to our software solutions and securing new customers with our expanded SaaS offerings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capitalize on Transition from 3G to 4G. There is currently a major technology shift taking place in which wireless carriers are required to gradually shut down older generation networks, known as the 3G network sunset. Since the transportation industry relies on near-constant network connectivity with the back office for their day-to-day operations, the 3G network sunset will be a significant challenge as fleets will need to replace equipment to ensure they can continue operating safely and efficiently. This transition has presented a significant growth opportunity for CalAmp as we assist our customers in making this transition to newer 4G LTE networks and equipment prior to the mandated 3G shut-down dates for carriers. We believe this transition could provide sustained demand for our solutions and services well into fiscal 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand in Key Verticals and Target Geographies. We are leveraging our existing customer relationships, international subscribers and recent acquisitions to further expand into global markets including Latin America, Europe, Middle East & Africa, and Asia Pacific. Our global expansion strategy is focused on countries with anticipated demand for our full stack of SaaS applications and services, cloud platform and telematics devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Presence in Industrial IoT. We believe that our current distribution footprint covers a significant portion of the global industrial IoT market due to our strong relationships with large enterprise accounts such as Caterpillar. We intend to leverage our core competencies of working with these global enterprises while expanding our presence with other industrial equipment OEMs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We listen to our customers’ needs both to understand their pain points and to help improve their day-to-day businesses. We strive to find new ways to use our connected intelligence to digitize their businesses, streamline their operations and empower them with new insights to make their business environments safer today and in the future..
Enterprise Customers - We sell our products and services directly to large global enterprises and industrial OEM customers. These customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements. Our sales, product development and support teams are organized to address these different requirements. Additionally, certain customers often have unique technical requirements and manufacturing processes, and may request specific product configurations, feature sets and designs. Sales to large enterprise customers often involve complex program management and long sales cycles, and require close cooperation between sales, operations and engineering personnel. As such, we have developed teams of key account managers and business development managers to serve the unique requirements of these customers. Some of the global enterprises we serve include Amazon, Caterpillar, Hertz, Omnitracs, Toyota, Trimble and Volkswagen Financial, among others.
 Telematics Service Providers (“TSPs”) and Channel Partners - We market and sell our products and services to small- and mid-sized companies through our well-established sales team and Channel Partner Program that includes various Telematics Service Providers, Value-Added Resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators and mobile network operators. These partners integrate our telematics solutions with their value-added applications to deliver purpose-built solutions that are sold through to restaurant, farming, water & waste management and construction industries, among others. 
 Strategic Partners – We have developed third party strategic partnerships to serve a wide range of customers from enterprises to small businesses.  CalAmp has established strategic partnerships with supply chain management service providers including CargoSense, Overhaul, Cryoport and RoviTracker. We also partner with leading global insurance companies to provide stolen vehicle recovery services and help insurance carriers better manage risk, minimize replacement losses and improve customer service. We also partner with mobile network operators including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and Telefonica, among others, to provide connectivity solutions for our customers. 
 Our global direct sales organization consists of teams of field salespeople, key account managers and business development managers, who work closely with applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel based primarily across our U.S. locations. We have organized our field sales personnel, together with internal sales, into teams within each business group based on their specialized knowledge and expertise relating to specific application and service areas, geographies and customer groups. These sales teams are closely aligned with their respective product management, engineering and operations organizations. 
 We expect that our reputation for providing innovative, high-quality solutions will continue to play a significant role in our growth and success, and that high customer satisfaction will continue to fuel referrals of our brand to new customers. Through our trademarked name – CalAmp – we have built a highly recognizable brand in the global enterprise, fleet management and supply chain market verticals. We also provide the award-winning Here Comes The Bus application to the K-12 educational market as well as the award-winning application called Bus Guardian, that provides contact-tracing to protect students and drivers on school buses, which has been especially critical during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Bus Guardian provides regular school bus ridership data, pick-up and drop-off times, as well as other associated statistics reflecting both drivers and students. This data is extremely important particularly in cases where buses serve multiple schools. Bus Guardian helps school administers monitor and manage sanitation assessment and application procedures across their fleets with its unique hygiene verification features. This real-time data has helped to keep staff, students and families across the country safe amidst the pandemic.

Recent Developments 
 COVID-19 
 In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus entitled COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to other countries including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic still remains uncertain given the diversity of rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. The pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. Through fiscal 2021, our revenues were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as various small-to-medium customers postponed their capital expenditure due to the pandemic and related macro-economic uncertainties. The pandemic has also created certain global supply imbalances resulting in supply shortages in certain components that we use. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our future business or operating results, which is highly dependent on uncertain future developments, including the severity of the continuing pandemic and the actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment. Because our business is dependent on telematics product sales, device installations and related subscription-based services, the ultimate effect of the outbreak may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.
 We have considered all known and reasonably available information that existed as of February 28, 2021, in making accounting judgments, estimates and disclosures. We are monitoring the potential effects of the health care related and economic conditions resulting from COVID-19 including (but not limited to) supply chain disruptions, decreases in customer demand for our products and services, potential longer-term effects on our customer and distribution channels particularly in the U.S. and relevant end markets as well as other developments. If the impacts from these contingencies result in longer-term closures of businesses and economic recessionary conditions, we may recognize additional material asset impairments, charges for uncollectible accounts receivable in future periods and additional restructuring charges.

Wind Down Plan and Subsequent Sale of LoJack U.S. SVR Operations
 On December 16, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a plan for management to commence with the wind down of the LoJack U.S. SVR operations. This business unit has historically provided stolen vehicle recovery (SVR) products operating on a radio frequency allocated by the FCC for domestic automotive dealerships. These products and related services have been provided predominately as a hardware-based offering that no longer aligns with our core strategy. Subsequent to the public announcement of this plan, we received inbound inquiries from certain parties interested in acquiring the business. 
 On January 22, 2021, we received a formal proposal from Spireon Holdings, L.P. (“Spireon”) to acquire the LoJack U.S. and Canadian SVR (“LoJack North America”) business for a purchase price of $8.0 million. Effective March 15, 2021, the Company and Spireon entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold certain assets and transferred certain liabilities of the LoJack North America business to Spireon.
 Since the LoJack North America operations were deemed to be a business that met the held for sale criteria under ASC 205-20-45, Presentation of Financial Statements – Discontinued Operations, management has presented the operations for this business as Discontinued Operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See Note 2, Discontinued Operations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this subsequent event.
 We will continue supporting our existing customers and law enforcement partners to allow sufficient time for an orderly transition out of the business. Additionally, we will continue operating and investing in our LoJack international business which operates in a subscription-based business model and is well aligned with our core SaaS strategy.
 Manufacturing and Operations 
 While the vast majority of our products are designed in the U.S., we currently outsource a substantial portion of our manufacturing to certain contract manufacturers. Our electronic devices, components and made-to-order assemblies used in our system solutions can be obtained from these manufacturers, although a few components are obtained from sole source suppliers. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which provide for certain product quality requirements. We are not vertically integrated, which provides us with flexibility and an ability to adapt to changes in the market, product supply and pricing while keeping our fixed costs low. Our relationships with our manufacturers are critical to new product introduction and the success of our business. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us to meet supply and support requirements stipulated by our customers. In fiscal year 2019, we commenced a plan to streamline our global operations including further outsourcing of our manufacturing functions to increase supplier diversification and reduce operating expenses. We now have full manufacturing capabilities in Taiwan, Malaysia and Mexico in addition to some limited production in China and Hong Kong. Furthermore, our production and distribution facility in Oxnard California was closed, and we are now utilizing our outsourced partner in Fort Worth, Texas for certain US distribution.   
 We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with all our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations team based in the U.S. coordinates with our manufacturers’ engineers and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing as well as a general oversight of ongoing manufacturing activities. We believe this model has allowed us to deliver high quality and innovative products in a timely manner while enabling us to minimize costs, manage inventory risk and maintain flexibility.
 We are certified to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9001: 2008 Quality management systems standard.
 Research and Development
 We compete in markets characterized by industry disruption, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product features. We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative new products and solutions as well as enhancements to our existing products and solutions with advanced 
 9


functionality and ease of use to drive customer demand and to further enhance our global brand and drive recurring revenue. We will continue to focus our research and development resources primarily on developing telematics products, services and software solutions for fleet management, heavy equipment, stolen vehicle recovery, consumer aftermarket telematics, trailer & asset tracking, transportation & logistics, and industrial monitoring & controls applications. We have developed a technology platform that can be leveraged across many of our vertical markets, applications and geographic regions. This includes a cloud-based telematics application enablement platform and end-user software applications, cellular and satellite communications network-based asset tracking units, as well as 3G and 4G LTE broadband router products primarily for mobile applications. In addition, our development resources have been allocated to rationalizing existing product lines, reducing product costs, and improving performance through product redesign efforts.
 Our research and development expenses from continuing operations in fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were $25.8 million, $27.0 million and $25.5 million, respectively. During this three-year period, our research and development expenses have ranged between 8% and 9% of annual consolidated revenues.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our solution and services through our global direct sales organization, Channel Partner Program and sales representatives as well as our websites and digital presence. Our global direct sales organization consists of teams of field salespeople, key account managers and business development managers, who work closely with solutions and applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel based primarily at our U.S. locations. We have organized our field sales personnel, together with internal sales and field support personnel, into teams within each business group based on their specialized knowledge and expertise relating to specific solutions and service areas, geographies and customer groups. These sales teams are closely aligned with their respective solutions management, engineering and operations organizations. 
 We sell our solutions and services to large global enterprises, small- to mid-sized companies, channel accounts and distributors as well as industrial OEM customers. These categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements, and we have organized our sales teams to address these different requirements. Additionally, certain customers often have unique technical requirements and manufacturing processes, and may request specific system configurations, feature sets and designs. Sales to large enterprise customers often involve complex program management and long sales cycles, and require close cooperation between sales, operations and engineering personnel. As such, we have developed teams of key account managers and business development managers to serve the unique requirements of these customers.
 We also actively sell our products in certain markets through independent sales representatives and distributors. We have entered into agreements with substantially all of our distributors. In some cases, we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain products in a specific geographic area. These agreements generally have terms of one year, which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period. 
 
We expect that our reputation for providing innovative and high-quality solutions will continue to play a significant role in our growth and success, and that high customer satisfaction will continue to fuel referrals of our brand to new customers. Through our trademarked name – CalAmp – we have built a highly recognizable brand in the global enterprise asset tracking and fleet management market verticals.
 
We will continue our investment in sales and marketing programs that further build brand awareness, drive deeper customer engagement and foster long-term relationships with our customers. Our marketing programs are now focused on supporting multi-channel product launches in new geographic markets.
 
Additionally, we are focused on maximizing our efficiency and the reach of our marketing spend by investing in public relations, social media and digital marketing programs. These programs are developed to educate our potential customers and other industry influencers to fuel active engagement with our products and services. Our activities around public relations, thought leadership, social media and digital marketing will be aligned with our customary product launches, media campaigns and presence at tradeshows and high exposure venues such as Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Mobile World Congress Americas in Los Angeles and other high-profile industry events, although recently, most of these events have been cancelled amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Our revenues from continuing operations derived from customers in the U.S. represented 65%, 69% and 69% of consolidated revenues in fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Competition
 Our markets are highly competitive. We face competition from small to large public and private competitors some of which have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources as well as greater economies of scale than we do. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products and services are global scale, innovation, reputation, customer service, product quality, functionality and reliability, time-to-market, responsiveness and price. We believe that we compete favorably in all of these areas. Our continued success in our vertical markets will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate, design quality products and deploy solutions at competitive prices and with superior support services to our customers.
 Some of the more established competitors for telematics systems and related connected products include Danlaw, Mobile Devices, Orbcomm, Quake Global, Queclink, Sierra Wireless, Spireon, Teltonika, Inseego, and Xirgo. Additionally, the market for Software and Subscription Services is also highly competitive and includes well-established companies such as Geotab, Samsara, Octo Telematics, Omnitracs, OnStar, Trimble, Verizon Connect and Zonar Systems as well as numerous smaller players. 
 BACKLOG 
 
As of February 28, 2021, our remaining contract performance obligations for software & subscription services were approximately $145 million as compared to $129 million as of February 29, 2020. The majority of our growth in contract performance obligations was driven by new customer acquisitions within the government and municipalities as well as connected car end markets. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of our remaining contract performance obligations as of February 28, 2021 in fiscal 2022. 
 
Total backlog for our hardware products as of February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $65.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively. Substantially all of the backlog at February 28, 2021 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2022. Our backlog for hardware products increased year-over-year as we experienced significant supply shortages which were primarily attributable to global supply imbalances caused by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, we often rely on inbound licenses of intellectual property for use in our business.
 We own and utilize the tradenames “CalAmp” and “LoJack” as well as the related logos and trademarks on all of our products and solutions. We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand. We own over 200 active trademark applications and registrations throughout the world, with approximately 30 pending and registered trademarks in the U.S. 
 In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, manufacturers, and others. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. 
 As of February 28, 2021, we had almost 300 patents worldwide. In addition to our awarded patents, we have approximately 80 patent applications in process. Although a number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to software and products that are significant to our business and operations, we do not believe we are dependent on a single trademark, copyright or patent.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 We are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the clean-up of contaminated sites, and close oversight of our product’s material compliance including adherence to relevant EPA regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.
 We have established environmental management systems and continually update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws.
 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
 We believe responsible and sustainable business practices support our long-term success. As a company, we are deeply committed to protecting and supporting our people, our environment, and our communities. That commitment is reflected through sustainability-focused initiatives as well as day-to-day activities, including our adoption of sustainability-focused policies and procedures, our publicly recognized focus on fostering an inclusive workplace, our constant drive toward more efficient use of materials and energy, our careful and active management of our supply chain, our products which help reduce carbon footprints and enhance road safety, and our impactful, globally integrated ethics and compliance program.
