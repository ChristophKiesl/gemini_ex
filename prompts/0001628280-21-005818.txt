General
The Children’s Place, Inc. is the largest pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer in North America. We design, contract to manufacture, sell at retail and wholesale, and license to sell trend right, high quality children’s apparel, footwear, and accessories predominately at value prices, under the proprietary “The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, and “Gymboree” brand names. Our physical stores offer a friendly and convenient shopping environment, segmented into departments that serve the wardrobe needs of girls and boys (sizes 4-18), toddler girls and boys (sizes 6 months-5T), and baby (sizes 0-24 months). Our merchandise is also available online at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com. Our 
customers are able to shop online and receive the same merchandise available in our physical stores, in addition to certain merchandise which is exclusive to our e-commerce sites.
The Children’s Place was founded in 1969. The Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 1997. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 749 stores throughout North America as well as our online stores. During Fiscal 2020, we opened 3 stores and closed 178 stores. During Fiscal 2019, we opened 12 stores and closed 60 stores. 
 Jane Elfers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, established several key strategic initiatives:
1.Superior Product - Product is our number one priority. We are focused on providing the right product, in the right channels of distribution, at the right time. We offer a full line of footwear and accessories so busy moms can quickly and easily put together head-to-toe outfits. Our design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning teams strive to ensure that our product is trend right, while at the same time balancing fashion and fashion basics with more frequent, wear-now deliveries. We reintroduced the iconic Gymboree brand in February 2020 on an enhanced Gymboree website and in certain co-branded locations in Company stores in the U.S. and Canada and were encouraged by the initial customer response to the relaunch prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2.Digital Transformation - The transformation of our digital capabilities continues to expand with the development of completely redesigned responsive sites and mobile applications, providing an online shopping experience geared toward the needs of our “on-the-go” customers, expanded customer personalization, which delivers unique, relevant content designed to drive sales, loyalty and retention, and the ability to have our entire store fleet equipped with ship-from-store capabilities. Also, in response to increased digital demand, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has increased and will continue to increase the utilization of its third-party logistics provider to further support both our U.S. and Canadian e-commerce operations.
3.Fleet Optimization - We continue to evaluate our store fleet as part of our fleet optimization initiative. We have closed 449 stores, including the 178 stores closed during Fiscal 2020, since the announcement of this initiative in 2013. As accelerated demand for online purchasing has increased our digital business, partly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have accelerated our planned store closures and are targeting 300 retail store closures in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, bringing our total store closures since the fleet optimization initiative began in 2013 to approximately 570 stores.
Overlaying these strategic initiatives is talent. Talent ultimately defines our success, and, over the past several years, we have built a best-in-class management team. We believe that our talented team is a significant competitive advantage for our Company.
Underlying these growth initiatives is a commitment to operational excellence. The Company’s commitment to operational excellence includes disciplined expense management and a focus on persistent improvement in store and e-commerce operations, and combined with our finance, compliance, legal, and human resources areas, form the strong base necessary to support our long-term growth initiatives.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted regions all around the world, resulting in restrictions and shutdowns of businesses and other activities implemented by national, state, and local authorities and private entities, leading to significant adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial and retail markets. Federal, state, and local governments and health officials worldwide have imposed and continue to impose varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as travel bans, restrictions on public gatherings, forced closures of businesses and other activities, social distancing, the adoption of remote or hybrid learning models for schools, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. In addition, certain mall owners have restricted hours of operation and the number of people permitted in stores. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic and consumer spending on discretionary items.
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced significant business disruption, and on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores across the U.S. and Canada. We re-opened the majority of our stores during the last two weeks of June and, as of January 30, 2021, we had 680 of 749 stores open to the public in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, with all but one store of the temporarily closed stores located in Canada. Our distribution centers remain open and operating to support our retail store and e-commerce business, which e-commerce business has significantly increased since the temporary store closures.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took the following actions designed to preserve our financial flexibility:
•Executing a substantial reduction and/or deferral of all non-essential expenses and capital expenditures;
•Collaborating with vendor partners to extend payment terms and balance forward inventory receipts to reflect reduced demand;
•Temporarily suspended rent payments on all of our U.S. and Canadian retail stores during the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 and resumed rent payments on a modified basis as stores began to re-open during the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. Our lease flexibility gave us the opportunity to strategically secure rent abatements for Fiscal 2020 and/or forward rent reductions. We have reached agreements in principle with many of our major landlords and are in discussions with most of the remaining landlords;
•We are targeting 300 retail store closures through Fiscal 2021, inclusive of the 178 stores permanently closed in Fiscal 2020, and 122 planned store closures in Fiscal 2021;
•Effective April 1, 2020, Jane Elfers, President and Chief Executive Officer, forfeited 100% of her salary. In addition, the senior leadership team took a 25% reduction in salary and the independent Directors of the Board unanimously approved to forgo their cash compensation. Effective June 28, 2020, the base salaries of the executives noted above and the cash compensation of the independent Directors of the Board were reinstated to 100% of pre-reduction levels;
•Effective April 5, 2020, all U.S. and Canadian field management and store associates were temporarily furloughed, with the Company continuing to provide health benefits, until needed to support ship-from-store activities or stores were re-opened;
•Effective April 5, 2020, we instituted a combination of temporary furloughs and pay reductions for the substantial majority of our corporate staff. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020 a majority of our furloughed employees returned to work and, effective June 28, 2020, salaries were reinstated to 100% of pre-reduction levels;
•Temporarily suspended the Company’s capital return program, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends;
•Finalized an amendment to our revolving credit facility, which increased borrowing capacity from $325 million to $360 million for a period of one year; 
•Secured an $80 million term loan on October 5, 2020. We used all of the net proceeds from the term loan to pay down revolving credit facility borrowings; and 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took the following steps to address the health, safety, and welfare of our employees and customers: instituted incentive pay, emergency leave, sick pay, and health insurance payment programs for our employees; provided training, health screening, onsite clinical services at our U.S. distribution center, personal protective equipment, and plexiglass health guard partitions, as well as rigorous cleaning routines and other measures in accordance with Federal, state and local guidance; and limited retail store and distribution center capacity.
Gymboree Acquisition
On April 4, 2019, we completed the acquisition of certain intellectual property and related assets (the “Gymboree Assets”) of Gymboree Group, Inc. and related entities, which includes the worldwide rights to the names “Gymboree” and “Crazy 8” and other intellectual property, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and customer databases.  Gymboree is an iconic children’s apparel brand offering colorful, playful, bow-to-toe children’s clothing collections that celebrate childhood and help families look their best for any occasion. Gymboree collections incorporate themes that come to life through vibrant color palettes, prints, textures, graphics, and high-quality, durable fabrics.  We relaunched the Gymboree branded product in February 2020 with an enhanced, personalized, online shopping experience at www.gymboree.com and in certain co-branded locations in select The Children’s Place stores across the U.S. and Canada and were encouraged by the initial customer response to the relaunch prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Segment Reporting
In accordance with FASB ASC 280—Segment Reporting, we report segment data based on geography: The Children’s Place U.S. and The Children’s Place International.  Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com.  Included in The Children’s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico based stores and revenue from our U.S.-based wholesale business. Included in The Children’s Place International segment are our Canadian-based stores, revenue from the Company’s Canada wholesale business, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes.  Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment.  Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services, are managed by The Children’s Place U.S. segment.  Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children’s Place International segment based primarily on net sales.  The assets related to these functions are not allocated.  We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business circumstances.  Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and we have no 
major customers that account for more than 10% of our net sales. The following tables show, by segment, our net sales and operating income for the past three fiscal years and total assets as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020:

Key Capabilities
Our objective is to sell high quality, value priced, trend right children’s merchandise. Our merchandise assortment offers one stop shopping across apparel, footwear, and accessories. 
Merchandising Strategy
Our merchandising strategy delivers a compelling and coordinated assortment of apparel, footwear, and accessories that facilitate the purchase of head-to-toe outfits. We merchandise our deliveries by season and flow new product to stores monthly.
 High Quality and Value 
We believe that offering high quality, value priced, trend right apparel, footwear, and accessories under “The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, and “Gymboree” brand names is a competitive advantage. 
Brand Image
We focus on our brand image and strengthening our customer loyalty by:
•Consistently offering high quality and age appropriate products and trend right fashion predominately at value prices in a friendly and convenient shopping environment;
•Providing coordinated outfits and accessories for our customers’ lifestyle needs;
•Providing exclusive products on our e-commerce sites to expand the breadth of our offerings;
•Creating strong merchandising and visual presentations to create a compelling in-store experience; 
•Emphasizing our great value fashion in marketing visuals to convey a consistent message across our brands;
•Leveraging our customer database to communicate with our customers and personalize communications to maximize customer satisfaction; and
•Utilizing our MyPLACE Loyalty Rewards program and private label credit card to drive customer engagement.
Low-Cost Global Sourcing 
We design, source, and contract to manufacture the substantial majority of the Company’s branded products. We believe that this is essential to assuring the consistency and quality of our merchandise, as well as our ability to deliver value to our customers. We have strong multi-year relationships with the substantial majority of our vendors. Through these relationships and our extensive knowledge of low cost sourcing on a global scale, we are able to offer our customers high-quality products at predominately value prices. We maintain a network of sourcing offices globally in order to manage our vendors efficiently and respond to changing business needs effectively. Our sourcing offices in China (Hong Kong and Shanghai), Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Ethiopia, and our presence in greater Africa, Cambodia, and other countries in which we source products, give us access to a wide range of vendors and allow us to work to maintain and/or reduce our merchandise costs by capitalizing on new sourcing opportunities while maintaining our high standard for product quality.
Merchandising Process
The strong collaboration between our cross-functional teams in design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning have enabled us to build our brands. 
Design
The design team gathers information from trends, color services, research, and trade shows. 
Merchandising
Each quarter, we develop seasonal merchandising strategies. 
Planning and Allocation
The planning and allocation organization works collaboratively with the merchandising, finance, and global sourcing teams to develop seasonal sales and margin plans to support our financial objectives and merchandising strategies. Further, this team plans the flow of inventory to ensure that we are adequately supporting floor sets and key promotional periods. Special attention is paid to our store types, as they differ in brand, capacity, and layout. 
Production, Quality Assurance, and Responsible Sourcing
During Fiscal 2020, we engaged independent contract vendors located primarily in greater Asia and Africa. We continue to pursue global sourcing opportunities to support our inventory needs and seek to reduce merchandise costs. We contract for the manufacture of the substantial majority of the products we sell. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. 
During Fiscal 2020, we sourced all of our merchandise directly without the use of third-party commissioned buying agents for The Children’s Place branded product. For the initial launch of Gymboree branded product, we utilized a third-party commissioned buying agent to reconnect with the key vendors that formerly supported the brand’s elevated expectations for quality and consistency. Following the initial launch we sourced all of our merchandise for Gymboree branded product without the use of that third-party. We source from a diversified network of vendors, purchasing primarily from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. No other country accounted for 10% or more of our production. 
In addition to our quality assurance procedures, we conduct a responsible sourcing program that seeks to protect our Company and enhance our brands by providing guidance in line with industry standards to our global vendors in their efforts to provide safe and appropriate working conditions for their employees. These efforts are part of an ongoing process to encourage the continued improvement by our vendors of factory working conditions, and ultimately, the lives of their employees who make our product. Additionally, under our responsible sourcing program, we monitor changes in local laws and other 
conditions (e.g., worker safety, workers’ rights of association, and political and social instability) in the countries from which we source in order to identify and assess potential risks to our sourcing capabilities.
We are currently also assessing the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and we intend to begin reporting under the SASB framework in Fiscal 2021. The SASB assists businesses in identifying, managing and reporting on sustainability topics of importance to investors. SASB’s materiality assessment assisted us by informing the design and implementation of initiatives to address topics such as the environmental impacts of our Company’s supply chain and manufacturing processes, as well as social matters concerning safe and fair working conditions and worker well-being. 
The components of our sustainability program and related environmental, social and government initiatives are as follows:
•Vendor Code of Conduct - By formally acknowledging and agreeing to our vendor code of conduct, our vendors affirm their commitment to integrate compliance with local law, industry standards, and ethical practices into their manufacturing and sourcing practices. Topics covered by these standards include child labor, involuntary or forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, coercion or harassment, discrimination, health and safety, transparency and integrity, compensation, working hours, freedom of association, environment, unauthorized subcontracting, security practices, and undue influence of independent auditors. 
•Addressing Forced Labor - We recognize the importance of eliminating forced labor within the supply chain and its increasing significance in light of recent reports of human rights abuses involving the treatment of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang Province, China. As mentioned above, our vendor code of conduct prohibits the use of forced labor, and we will not knowingly conduct business with vendors or factories that use forced labor or engage in slavery or human trafficking. We do not source any goods produced in the Xinjiang Province, and our Company prohibits the sourcing of any textiles, cotton, fibers, yarn and other raw materials from the region. We expect all of our vendors and suppliers to conduct sufficient due diligence in their supply chains to ensure compliance with our vendor code of conduct, and we continue to expand our own due diligence activities and vendor engagement and training on this important issue.
•Ongoing Auditing Program - We administer a factory auditing program staffed by our internal quality assurance and responsible sourcing teams and/or professional third-party auditors, who periodically visit factory locations to provide insight into general factory working conditions and other production characteristics in all factories that manufacture The Children’s Place products.  With this information, we can understand factories’ challenges, help the factories identify non-compliance with legal and industry standards, and offer guidance on corrective action plans for the factories to achieve better compliance. All factories that are approved for The Children’s Place production must undergo technical capabilities and responsible sourcing audits prior to any orders being placed and periodically thereafter.
•Corrective Action Plans - Following each audit, a corrective action plan outlines any areas of non-compliance identified through the factory audit. Each factory is expected to develop a remediation plan and remediation timeline for any non-compliance found. Through follow-up audits, we assess a factory’s progress in achieving its remediation plan. It is our preference to work with factories to remediate and achieve compliance rather than terminate our relationship; however, where there is serious non-compliance of critical standards, repeated non-compliance, or failure of the factories to invest in continued improvement, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship.
•Vendor Factory Engagement - Our responsible sourcing team provides guidance and training to vendors and factories in order to help vendors and factories improve compliance with industry standards and local laws. Our goal is to serve as a resource for vendors and factories as they develop and strengthen their capabilities to better manage the working conditions of their employees.
•Safe and Fair Working Conditions – Our Company seeks to work with third-party vendors and factories that are committed to providing fair and safe working conditions, and that demonstrate strong business ethics and transparency in their manufacturing practices. Below are the Company’s partners that provide programs which are designed to improve vendor and factory compliance in the apparel and footwear industry:
•ILO’s BetterWork program - Partnering with over 100 companies and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank, this program works with global brands, factory owners, governments, unions and workers to improve working conditions in the garment industry through assessments, training, advocacy and research. BetterWork’s gender strategy aims to empower women workers, address sexual harassment and close the gender pay gap in the global garment industry. The BetterWork program is sponsored by our Company in over 60 factories in seven countries in Asia, Africa and Central America.
•The Social & Labor Convergence Project (“SLCP”) - The SLCP is a multi-stakeholder initiative among manufacturers, retailers, industry groups and civil society organizations working to develop a simple, unified and effective assessment framework for monitoring factories. Our shared goal is to increase the effectiveness of factory audits, reduce audit fatigue and better utilize collective resources in the apparel industry’s supply chain.
•Nirapon - Nirapon oversees ongoing safety, training and helpline efforts for factories in Bangladesh. Nirapon replaced The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which concluded in December 2018, and was a multi-stakeholder, five-year commitment of 29 North American retailers and brands to improve safety and empower workers in Bangladeshi apparel factories. Our Company was a founding member of the Alliance and supports the extension of its impact through the continuing efforts of Nirapon.
•Worker Well-Being Programs - Our global responsible sourcing activities involve the Company’s third-party factories who manufacture our merchandise. These vendors’ workforce is predominantly women who work in factories in underdeveloped countries in greater Asia and Africa.  In addition to our auditing activities concerning local laws and ethical business practices, worker health and welfare, working conditions, safety, rights of association, and other practices at factories, our commitment to responsible sourcing activities extends beyond a compliance-based approach to a more holistic view, focusing not only on compliance but also on worker well-being through training and education, as we seek to improve the daily lives of the factory workers who make our Company’s products. In support of our business and societal objectives and those of our vendors to create and sustain a healthy and engaged workforce, below are examples of programs sponsored by us:
•BSR’s HERproject - This program is designed to positively impact the well-being of women through workplace-based education and training provided by local non-governmental organizations to promote health, gender equality, financial inclusion and other life-needs. We sponsor this program in its key sourcing regions, including in Ethiopia, where the program in the Hawassa Industrial Park will reach over 7,000 women garment workers.
•CARE’s Healthy Food Healthy Workplace Program - This program aims to improve garment workers’ awareness of the health benefits of nutritious foods and good hygiene. We have invested in this program in Cambodia to support healthy eating choices in order to improve health and combat instances of workplace fainting which is a phenomenon experienced in the garment industry in Cambodia.
•The Centre for Child Rights and Business - In partnership with global brands like our Company, The Centre for Child Rights and Business (formerly CCR CSR) provides education and training designed to improve the lives of children and parent factory workers. We have invested in the Distance Without Separation program in China to provide migrant parents separated from their homes and children with tools to better connect with their children, and ultimately, strengthen parent-child bonds when families are separated due to work commitments. This leads to parent workers feeling more secure about the well-being of their children, enabling them to be more engaged and productive in the workplace.
•The Solidarity Center - In partnership with The Solidary Center, other U.S. brands, local women’s rights groups and trade associations, and international NGOs, our Company and the other U.S. brands sponsor a pilot program administered by independent experts at apparel factories located in Lesotho, Africa to address gender-based violence and harassment, such as by providing training, monitoring and an anonymous hotline.
•Support for Children and Families in Need – Our commitment to having a positive social influence also extends to our Company’s charitable mission of supporting children and families in need. As part of our philanthropic strategy, we (and our associates) donate money, clothing and time to local and national organizations in support of this mission, and accordingly, we provide matching donations consistent with our Company’s policies. For instance, over the span of the last three years, we have donated new children’s clothing with a retail value of over $60 million to our corporate charitable partners. In Fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created extreme disruption in the retail industry and our Company turned a difficult situation into a positive social impact. Through two special donations, we donated approximately 4.5 million units of new spring and holiday clothing with a retail value of over $55 million to the non-profit organization Delivering Good. Delivering Good works with retailers, manufacturers and other partners to distribute aid to families impacted by natural disasters, poverty and COVID-19 around the world.
•Environmental Stewardship - In Fiscal 2020, we published our first enterprise-level environmental policy, and expanded our sustainability activities to include environmental initiatives in our domestic operations, as well as in our global supply chain. Our Company has identified areas where we believe we can make a difference and we have established goals in an effort to positively impact the communities and environments affected by our business. To have the greatest impact, we chose to collaborate with non-profit organizations and other peers in the apparel and footwear industry to work with third-party vendors and their factories to reduce environmental impacts from manufacturing activities. We are committed to a long-term approach with those vendors that demonstrate sustainability leadership by utilizing their resources more responsibly and efficiently. Our Company’s environmental impact program addresses the following environmental topics:
•Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions - During Fiscal 2020, we engaged an environmental consultant to map energy consumption in both our domestic operations and in the production of our products by our global third-party factories. This mapping exercise allowed our Company to build a multi-year roadmap to reduce GHG emissions across our global operations. We have received approval of our goals from the Science Based Targets Initiative, validating that these goals are in line with the latest climate science to reduce global GHG emissions to a target level recommended by the scientific community.
•Responsibly Sourced Raw Materials and Sustainable Materials - Our Company is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative (“BCI”) which is the largest cotton sustainability program in the world. Working with organizations from farming, retail fashion, and textile brands, BCI is an agricultural standard system helping farmers use less water and fewer chemical pesticides and fertilizers, all while improving yields, profitability, and workers’ lives. We support cotton procurement practices that foster the payment of living wages and the reduction of pesticide and water use in our global supply chain. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, our Company expanded our list of environmental initiatives to include the increased use of more sustainable materials in the manufacture, packaging and sale of our products, including by increasing the use of Forest Stewardship Council mix paper in our paper materials, recycled plastic content in store shopping bags, recycled polyester content in yarn and pockets, and sustainable inks, dyes and finishes in our products.
•Chemical Management - In Fiscal 2020, we sought and received commitments from global vendors operating our top 20 denim and woven bottoms factories to reduce/manage their use of water, chemicals and energy in their operations. Our Company is also a member of the Apparel & Footwear International RSL Management Group (“AFIRM”) which works to build safer and more sustainable chemistry within the apparel and footwear supply chains. With members including some of the largest brands and retailers in the world, AFIRM provides resources to enable continuous advancement of chemical management best practices.
•Wastewater and Effluence- In Fiscal 2020, we identified waste diversion as another area of focus for our environmental initiatives. To support more sustainable wastewater processes at our third-party factories, the Company became a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (“SAC”). SAC is an industry-wide group of more than 250 members working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of products around the world. Through multi-stakeholder engagement, the SAC seeks to lead the industry toward a shared vision of sustainability built upon a common approach for measuring and evaluating apparel, footwear, and textile product sustainability performance that spotlights priorities for action and opportunities for technological innovation.
Company Stores
The following section highlights various store information for The Children’s Place operated stores as of January 30, 2021.
Existing Stores
As of January 30, 2021, we had a total of 749 The Children’s Place stores in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico and our online stores at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com. In addition, our eight international partners operated 230 international points of distribution in 19 countries. The following table sets forth the number of stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada as of the current and prior fiscal year end:

 | Number of Stores | 
Location | January 30, 2021 | February 1, 2020
United States | 640 | 795 
Canada | 101 | 121 
Puerto Rico | 8 | 8 
Total Stores | 749 | 924 

Store Concepts 
At The Children’s Place, our store concepts consist of multiple formats ranging in size from 3,400 to 7,100 square feet, which have evolved over time in response to market trends, and are strategically placed within each market. We try to create an open and brightly lit environment for customers.  Our stores typically feature white fixtures to ensure the product is the focal point, using color to brand and create shop identifiers. 
Fleet Optimization
We have closed 449 stores, including the 178 stores closed during Fiscal 2020, since the announcement of our fleet optimization initiative in 2013. As accelerated demand for online purchasing has increased our digital business, partly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have accelerated our planned store closures and are targeting 300 retail store closures in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, bringing our total closures since the fleet optimization initiative began in 2013 to approximately 570 stores. Since 2013, we have reduced our total store square footage from 5.2 million to 3.5 million. These closures have resulted in improved profitability and operating margin accretion due to sales transfer to surrounding stores and/or e-commerce, low cost of exit, and the elimination of underperforming locations. In markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores and e-commerce business in the area of the closing become more productive and profitable. These results further our commitment to continue to execute our optimization program.
We continuously review the performance of our store fleet. We base our decisions to open, close, or remodel stores on a variety of factors, including lease terms, landlord negotiations, market dynamics, and projected financial performance. When assessing whether to close a store, we also consider remaining lease life and current financial performance.
E-commerce Sales 
Our U.S. and International segments each include an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com, and digital growth remains one of our top strategic priorities. We are committed to delivering a best in class, end-to-end user experience, including product assortment and website operation, fulfillment, and customer service. We are further committed to delivering these experiences to our customers when, where, and how they are looking to access our brands, accounting for cross-channel behavior, growth of mobile devices, and the growing interest in our brands from international consumers. As such, we will continue to make required investments in back-end infrastructure, as well as front-end technology to deliver on this commitment. We believe that the critical investments made in areas such as e-commerce infrastructure and mobile optimization, as well as additional front-end website features, have improved our customer experience.
International Franchisees and Wholesale
We have 230 international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) with eight partners operating in 19 countries. We generate revenues from our franchisees from the sale of products and sales royalties. Our wholesale business includes our relationship with Amazon.
Store Operations
The Children’s Place store operations are organized by geographical region. Our US Vice Presidents and Canada Regional Director oversee a number of district managers residing within each region. We have a centralized corporate store operations function which supports the operations of our stores. Our stores are staffed by store managers and full-time and part-time sales associates, with additional temporary associates hired to support seasonal needs. Our store managers spend a high percentage of their time on the store’s selling floor providing direction, motivation, and development to store associates. To maximize selling productivity, our teams emphasize greeting, replenishment, presentation standards, procedures, and controls. In order to motivate our store management, we offer a monthly incentive compensation plan that awards bonuses for achieving certain financial goals.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with historically heavier concentrations of sales during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Our first fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, our second and third fiscal quarter results are dependent upon back-to-school sales, and our fourth fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the holiday season. The business is also subject to shifts due to unseasonable weather conditions. As described elsewhere herein, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the foregoing seasonal influences. The following table shows the quarterly distribution, as a percentage of the full year, of net sales and operating income (loss) (results in Fiscal 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the government mandated temporary closure of all of our stores for substantial periods of time during Fiscal 2020):

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Quarterly net sales as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2020 | 16.8 | % | | 24.2 | % | 27.9 | % | 31.1 | %
Fiscal 2019 | 22.0 | % | | 22.5 | % | 28.1 | % | 27.4 | %
Quarterly operating income (loss) as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2020 | (86.6) | % | | (32.3) | % | 11.7 | % | 7.2 | %
Fiscal 2019 | 5.2 | % | | 4.0 | % | 60.1 | % | 30.7 | %

Marketing
The Children’s Place and Gymboree are well-recognized brands, with a trend right offering and a compelling value proposition. Our direct marketing program utilizes both on-line and off-line channels. We relaunched the iconic Gymboree brand in February 2020 with a meaningfully improved digital experience on www.gymboree.com, complimented by shop-in-
shop locations in certain co-branded stores in the U.S. and Canada, by successfully executing on the specific design, sourcing, and merchandising characteristics that create Gymboree’s elevated, playful collections.
We have a customer loyalty program and a private label credit card program. At the end of Fiscal 2020, members of our MyPLACE Rewards loyalty program and/or private label credit card program accounted for approximately 80% of sales. Our private label credit card is issued to our customers for use exclusively at The Children’s Place stores and online at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com, and credit is extended to such customers through a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to us. We promote affinity and loyalty through our marketing programs by utilizing specialized incentive programs. 
Distribution
In the United States, we own and operate a 700,000 square foot distribution center in Alabama, which supports both U.S. retail store operations and U.S. e-commerce operations. In Canada, we lease and operate a 95,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario for our Canadian retail store operations. We also use a third-party provider located in Indiana and Ontario, Canada to support both our U.S. and Canadian e-commerce operations. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support seasonal warehousing needs. We also use a third-party provider of warehousing and logistics services in both Malaysia and China to support our international franchise business. 
Competition
The children’s apparel, footwear, and accessories retail markets are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are specialty stores, mass merchants, and off-price stores, including Target Corporation, Old Navy, GapKids, and babyGap (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), Carter’s, Inc., T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s (each of which is a division of TJX Companies, Inc.), Burlington Coat Factory, Inc., Kohl’s Corporation, Walmart Stores, Inc., and other department stores. We also compete with regional retail chains, catalog companies, and e-commerce retailers, including Amazon. One or more of our competitors are present in substantially all of the areas in which we have stores.
Trademarks and Service Marks
“The Children’s Place”, “Place”, “Baby Place”, “Gymboree”, and certain other marks have been registered as trademarks and/or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and other foreign countries. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company acquired the Gymboree Assets, which included the worldwide rights to the names “Gymboree” and “Crazy 8” and other intellectual property, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and customer databases. With respect to the already existing trademarks and the newly acquired “Gymboree” and “Crazy 8” trademarks, the registration of the trademarks and the service marks may be renewed to extend the original registration period indefinitely, provided the marks are still in use. We intend to continue to use and protect our trademarks and service marks and maintain their registrations. We have also registered our trademarks in other countries where we source our products and where we have established and possibly may establish franchising operations. We believe our trademarks and service marks have received broad recognition and are of significant value to our business.

We also are subject to similar international laws and regulations affecting our business. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

These products are imported and are subject to U.S. and Canadian customs laws and regulations, which restrict the importation of and impose tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duties on, certain imported products, including textiles, apparel, footwear, and accessories.

Human Capital
As of January 30, 2021, we had approximately 13,300 employees, approximately 1,900 of whom were based at our corporate offices and distribution centers. Approximately 1,700 were full-time store employees and approximately 9,700 were part-time and seasonal store employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
The Company's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee are actively engaged in overseeing the Company’s human capital management strategies, including our talent and succession planning initiatives designed to attract, develop, engage, reward, and retain top retail and digital leaders who can drive our financial and strategic growth objectives and contribute towards building long-term shareholder value. The Company has benefited greatly, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, from the stability of our senior leadership team who have an average tenure of over seven years, led by our President and CEO, who has led the Company for over a decade. The Board’s involvement in leadership development and succession planning is systematic and ongoing, culminating in an annual review of succession plans for all senior leaders of the Company’s management team, inclusive of development strategies for top talent within the Company. The Company has a strong track record of succession planning and growing talent within the organization with 67% of its senior leadership team promoted into their current role. Over the past fiscal year, 65% of all open corporate roles, 53% of all field management roles and 86% of all Vice President and above roles have been filled internally.
To improve the Board’s understanding of the Company’s culture and talent pipeline, the Board of Directors and its Committees periodically meet with high-potential executives in formal and informal settings. More broadly, the Board of Directors is regularly updated on key talent metrics for the overall workforce, including diversity and inclusion, pay equity, employee relations, recruiting and development programs, and overall progress against the company’s human capital development strategies. Diversity and inclusion are top priorities for the Company, and we are actively working to ensure that our workplace includes a range of perspectives and backgrounds at the Board level, in senior leadership, and throughout our employee base.
The Company reports annually on employment data, including ethnicity, in line with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, and continues to focus on building a culture which supports diversity and inclusion and ensures fair compensation for all employees regardless of gender or race.
