COVID 19 PANDEMIC
 
The recent COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our ongoing operations. To date the Company’s primary operating segment, Bombshell Technologies Inc., has not experienced a decline in sales as a result of the impact of COVID 19. The Company’s operations in the FinTech sector are carried out with a limited amount of person to person contact and we do not expect an impact on these operations as a result of COVID 19, however, the full effect of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report, is highly uncertain and subject to change. Operations of the Company’s Resort at Lake Selmac property were delayed until July 2020 when the government permitted the resort to reopen. Management does not expect the delay in opening the resort for the 2020-2021 season to substantially impact profitable operations for this business in the long term. Management is actively monitoring the situation but given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of 

4

the COVID-19 outbreak on its operations or financial condition in the next 12 months. While significant uncertainty remains, the Company does not believe the COVID-19 outbreak will have a negative impact on its  ability to raise additional financing, conclude the acquisition of targeted business operations or reach profitable operations.
 
Description of Business
 
Historical
 
Grow Capital, Inc. was incorporated on October 22, 1999 as Calibrus, in the State of Nevada. From its inception, the Company was a call center that contracted out as a customer contact center for a variety of business clients throughout the United States. Over time our main business became a third-party verification service.  After making a sale on the telephone, a company would send the call to a Company operator to confirm the order.  This process protected both the customer and the company selling services from telephone sales fraud.
 
While continuing to operate as a call center, in 2008 we expanded our business plan to include the development of a social networking site called JabberMonkey (Jabbermonkey.com) and the development of a location based social networking application for smart phones called Fanatic Fans.
 
In June 2014 we acquired WCS Enterprises, LLC ("WCS Enterprises"), an Oregon limited liability company which was formed on September 9, 2013, in exchange for shares of our common stock. WCS became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of WCS Enterprises resulted in a change of control of the Company and at, or shortly after the closing of such acquisition, the persons designated by WCS Enterprises became the officers and directors of the Company.  As a result of our acquisition of WCS Enterprises in June 2014, we became engaged in the business of being a real estate purchaser, developer and manager of specific use industrial properties business providing "Condo" style turn-key grow facilities to support cannabis growers in the United States cannabis industry. In 2013 WCS acquired real estate in Eagle Point in Jackson County, Oregon representing our sole condominium operating location.  The building of 15,000 square feet was zoned to meet the requirements for specific purpose industrial use and divided into four 1,500-2,000 square feet condo style grow rooms and one 7,500 square foot grow facility. WCS offered tenants the option to lease, lease to purchase or buy their condo warehouse and each condo unit was uniquely designed with all necessary resources as an optimum stand-alone grow facility. We leased the smaller condo units to individual tenants and the larger 7,500 sq ft grow facility to our former CEO and Chairman. The Company was not directly involved in the growing, distribution or sale of cannabis.
 
We acquired a second development site in 2016 located in the Pioneer Business Park near Eugene, OR, which we intended to develop, however the Company faced hostility from the local county government regarding the intended operations of the site, and the Company abandoned its plans for this site in late calendar 2017 and listed the property. In September 2018, the site was sold, and the Company received proceeds of approximately $74,000 after payment of expenses of the sale and full retirement of the attached mortgage of approximately $250,000. 
 
The Resort at Lake Selmac (Formerly Smoke on the Water, Inc.) (“RLS”), was incorporated on October 21, 2016, in the State of Nevada as a second wholly owned subsidiary. RLS was originally intended to capitalize on the country's growing level of recreational marijuana acceptance.  In March 2017, RLS acquired the Lake Selmac Resort located at 2700 Lakeshore Drive, Selma, Oregon. The Lake Selmac resort offers recreational facilities including fishing, swimming, boating, RV parking, tent camping & cabin accommodation, as well as a small convenience store for sundry supplies. 
 
On June 22, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase our authorized capital to 180,000,000 shares, consisting of 175,000,000 shares of common stock (“Common Stock”), par value $0.001, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”), par value $0.001 (the “Recapitalization”) and to change the name of the Company to “Grow Capital, Inc.” as we intended to expand our business focus into the financial technology (“FinTech”) sector. The Company filed articles of amendment with the State of Nevada to effect the aforementioned changes on July 10, 2018 and August 28, 2018, respectively. The Company received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") for the above noted corporate actions on August 8, 2019.

5

In connection with its name change, the Company adopted a business plan focused on shifting the Company’s strategy away from rental activities focused in cannabis industry and into FinTech and related sectors. In connection with this strategy, the Company hired a new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and appointed a new chairman of the Company’s board of directors, all of whom have significant experience in the FinTech sector. The Company determined to acquire FinTech companies with a clear niche and strong leadership and use its experience and understanding of the FinTech sector and access to the public markets to help build a portfolio of profitable operations. 
 
Current Operations 
 
In line with our change of operational focus, on June 26, 2019 the Company entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Bombshell Technologies, Inc. (“Bombshell”) and the shareholders of Bombshell (the “Bombshell Holders”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, which closed on July 23, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Bombshell (the “Bombshell Shares”) in exchange for the Bombshell Holders receiving the right to receive 5,533,773 shares (the “Consideration Shares”) of unregistered shares of the Company’s Common Stock on a pro rata basis (the “Exchange”), 1,650,000 of which were issued to the Bombshell Holders (the “Closing Shares”) at the Closing on a pro rata basis. The remaining 3,883,773 Consideration Shares (the “Secondary Shares”) were issued on September 3, 2019 upon approval of the increase to the Company’s authorized common stock to 550,000,000 shares, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, effective August 29, 2019. The Bombshell Holders are also eligible to receive earn-out consideration of up to an additional 1,838,461 shares of Common Stock (the “Earn-out Shares”) earnable in tranches of 612,820 shares of Common Stock in each of the second, third and fourth years after the Closing, based on whether Bombshell is able to meet certain Earnings Before Interest and Taxes thresholds in each year. The Bombshell Holders include certain limited liability companies owned by (i) Jonathan Bonnette, (ii) Joel Bonnette, and (iii) Terry Kennedy. At the date of this report it remains uncertain whether the EBIT targets which permit the earn out of the first tranche of the additional shares of common stock will be achieved as at the first valuation date. The shares issued in the Exchange are subject to certain registration rights with no liquidated damages for failure to complete registration by a specific date. 
 
With the acquisition of Bombshell, Grow Capital has shifted its operational mandate to becoming a solution-oriented company focused on software, technology and financial services business (i.e. FinTech). Our current management team consists of consultants and entrepreneurs that have combined decades of experience in this sector. Fintech is a term used to describe financial technology, an industry encompassing any kind of technology in financial services. This includes businesses and consumers and generally includes companies that provide financial services through software or other technology and ranging from mobile payment apps to cryptocurrency.
 
On July 8, 2019, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) to acquire Encompass More Group, Inc. (“Encompass”), a Nevada corporation. In connection with the LOI, Encompass issued a promissory note (the “Note”) to the Company pursuant to a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), dated July 22, 2019, by and between Encompass and the Company, in exchange for a loan of $100,000 (the “Loan”). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the proceeds of the Loan were to be used by Encompass for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Note had a twelve-month term, an interest rate of 5.0%, and was payable in monthly installments of $2,000, with all remaining principal and interest due on the maturity date, unless paid earlier by Encompass. The Board of Directors have subsequently determined not to proceed with the acquisition as contemplated under the LOI. On September 25, 2020, effective June 30, 2020, the Company negotiated an addendum to the Loan (the “Addendum”) in respect to an outstanding balance due under the Loan. Encompass paid a lump sum payment of $ and the Company and Encompass executed a new promissory note in the amount of $72,000 effective July 1, 2020 (the New Loan”). The New Loan requires twelve equal payments of $6,000 per month. Interest accrued as at June 30, 2020 on the Loan plus interest accrued on the New Loan at 5% per annum is due and payable at maturity, June 30, 2021. 
 
In connection with the shift in the Company’s strategy away from rental activities focused in cannabis industry, the Company sold WCS on September 30, 2019 by way of a membership interest purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Zallen Trust. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold all of the Company’s membership interests in WCS for an aggregate purchase price of $782,450. The Zallen Trust paid the purchase price by transferring to the Company 434,694 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, valued at $2.00 per share. The Purchase Agreement also provided that Mr. Zallen transfer to the Company an additional 20,000 shares of 

6

Common Stock to settle $36,000 in back rent owed at the time of the sale. The Company retired all of the shares received as a result of the transaction. In connection with the sale of WCS, the Company and Mr. Zallen entered into a separation and release of claims agreement pursuant to which the Company and Mr. Zallen provided a mutual release of claims against the other party and such party’s affiliates, including all claims related to Mr. Zallen’s service as an officer, employee, and director of the Company. The release of claims by Mr. Zallen resulted in the forgiveness of salary accruals of approximately $367,000 for services provided up to June 30, 2018. Mr. Zallen was the former CEO, Chairman and President of the Company. The Company reversed related payroll taxes of approximately $61,000 and included the amount in the gain on sale. 
 
Further, despite originally listing the Resort at Lake Selmac property for sale during September 2019 upon expiry of the listing agreement March 31, 2020, the Company determined to delay the sale, and to continue to operate the rebranded Resort at Lake Selmac as a family friendly RV resort facility in fiscal 2020. 
 
On February 12, 2020, the Company entered into a compensation agreement with its CFO, Trevor Hall beginning January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Hall’s compensation will consist of a fixed fee of Sixty Thousand (60,000) shares of the Company’s unregistered restricted common stock for his providing chief financial officer services. The shares are to be issued at a rate of Fifteen Thousand (15,000) shares per quarter, and vest immediately upon issuance.

Mr. Terry Kennedy was appointed to succeed Mr. Bonnette as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective April 1, 2020. Mr. Kennedy will serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer until his successor is appointed by the Board, or until his earlier resignation, removal or death.

Mr. Kennedy shall receive a fixed fee of 50,000 shares of unregistered, restricted common stock for his services. If a permanent executive compensation or employment agreement is not consummated prior to July 1, 2020, the Compensation Agreement will automatically renew for one additional three-month period beginning on July 1, 2020, with Mr. Kennedy entitled to receive up to an additional 50, 000 unregistered, restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, with the actual number of shares being prorated for the portion of the extended period actually served until the more permanent executive compensation/employment agreement is consummated.
 
On May 13, 2020 the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 1 for 20 reverse split whereby shareholders would receive one (1) post reverse split share of Common Stock for each twenty (20) pre-split shares of Common Stock.   The Company would pay cash to shareholders who were left with only a fractional share and would round up any other partial shares to the nearest whole share.  The corporate action was approved by FINRA and become effective on July 30, 2020 and all share and per share data included in this Annual Report has been retroactively impacted to reflect the share split. 
 
Subsequently on May 15, 2020 the Company entered into new compensation contracts with each of Jonathan Bonnette, CTO and Director and Carl Sanko, Director and Secretary, for a further term of one year whereunder they shall earn $320,000 and $270,000 respectively, such salaries to be settled by the issuance of unregistered, restricted shares of common stock. . 
 
On August 19, 2020, the Company acquired PERA LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“PERA”), pursuant to an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), effective as of August 3, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), by and between PERA, the members of PERA (the “PERA Members”), and the Company (the “Closing”), which was 

7

previously disclosed on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 11, 2020. At the Closing, PERA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Eric Tarno, the current President of PERA, will continue to serve as the President of PERA.
 Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, at the Closing, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interests of PERA (the “PERA Ownership Interests”) in exchange for 9,358,185 unregistered restricted shares of the Company’s common stock on a pro rata basis (the “Exchange”). At the Closing, the PERA Members conveyed all of the right, title and interest in and to the PERA Ownership Interests in exchange for the right to receive a number of shares of GC Common Stock equal to an exchange ratio (the “Exchange Ratio”). The Exchange Ratio is calculated by dividing (a) the Exchange Shares (as defined below) by (b) the total number of shares of PERA Ownership Interests outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date.
 “Exchange Shares” means the number of shares of GC Common Stock obtained by dividing (a) $10,000,000 by (b) the 10-day volume weighted average price per share (“VWAP”) calculated immediately before the date that the previously announced reverse stock split of GC Common Stock became effective on OTCQB, July 30, 2020.
 In addition, if PERA meets certain yearly targeted gross revenues for each of year one, two, and three following the Closing, the PERA owners may earn a cumulative total of up to $5,000,000 of shares of GC Common Stock (the “Earn-out Shares”) to be determined using the applicable 10-day VWAP stock price of the Company’s common stock preceding each earn-out period calculation date as set forth in the Exchange Agreement in connection with all of the three years, subject to certain catch up provisions if such yearly period targets are not met in the applicable period.
 All of the common stock, as well as the Earn-out Shares, if any, have or will be issued in reliance on the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. At the Closing the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the PERA Members to register the GC Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Exchange. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has granted certain demand and piggy-back registration rights whereby the Company will register the resale of the Common Stock issued in the Exchange.
 The PERA Members include certain limited liability companies owned by (i) Terry Kennedy, the CEO of the Company, (ii) Jonathan Bonnette, the CTO of the Company and the CEO of Bombshell Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, (iii) Joel Bonnette, brother of Jonathan Bonnette, and (iv) Carl Sanko, a director and Secretary of the Company, and (v) Jared Bonnette, brother of Jonathan Bonnette.
 Grow Capital expects to identify additional suitable acquisitions during fiscal 2021, complete those acquisitions, and expand our footprint as a Fintech company, achieving profitable operations. Any potential acquisitions or divestitures remain subject to final agreements, due diligence, and typical closing conditions.
 
Operating Subsidiaries
 
Resort at Lake Selmac
 
While the Company entered into a listing agreement for the divestiture of this operating location during fiscal 2020, it was subsequently determined by management to continue to operate the property upon the expiration of the listing agreement on March 31, 2020. As a result of the current decline in real estate transactions in the United States as a result of the pandemic, the Company will review the sale of this property when appropriate at a future date. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scheduled opening date for the resort of April 1, 2020 was postponed. The resort was able to be reopened in July 2020 once the local State guidelines permitted a return to operations. The Company intends to operate the resort year round and does not expect the delayed opening to have a subsequent impact on our operations. The resort is currently operated as a family friendly resort destination.
