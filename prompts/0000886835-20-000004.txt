Item 1. Business
General

We provide a wide variety of services and products to the energy industry. We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies around the world and we offer products and services with respect to the various phases of a well’s economic life cycle. We report our operating results in four business segments: Drilling Products and Services; Onshore Completion and Workover Services; Production Services; and Technical Solutions. Given our long-term strategy of geographic expansion, we also provide supplemental segment revenue information in three geographic areas: U.S. land; U.S. offshore; and International.

 For information about our operating segments and financial information by operating segment and geographic area, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Developments

The Combination

On December 18, 2019, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the Merger Agreement) to divest our U.S. service rig, coiled tubing, wireline, pressure control, flowback, fluid management and accommodations service lines (the Superior Energy U.S. Business) and combine them with Forbes Energy Services Ltd.’s (Forbes) complimentary service lines to create a new, publicly traded consolidation platform for U.S. completion, production and water solutions (the Combination).

Following the completion of the Combination, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, we will remain a globally diversified oilfield services company built around the following key product and service lines: premium drill pipe, bottom hole assemblies, completion tools and products, hydraulic workover, snubbing and production services and well control services. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Superior Energy U.S. Business and Forbes will be merged into a newly formed company (Newco). At the closing of the Combination, we will receive 49.9% of Newco’s issued and outstanding voting Class A common stock (the Class A Stock) and 100% of Newco’s issued and outstanding non-voting Class B common stock (the Class B Stock), which will collectively represent an approximate 65% economic interest in Newco. Our and Forbes’ economic interests in Newco are subject to adjustment within certain parameters based on Forbes’ net debt position calculated at closing pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain lenders under Forbes’ existing term loan (the Forbes Term Loan) will exchange their portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Forbes Term Loan for approximately $30.0 million in newly issued mandatory convertible preferred shares of Newco (the Preferred Shares), which will be entitled to cash dividends at a rate of 5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Combination will be subject to mandatory conversion into shares of Newco’s Class A Stock. After giving effect to such conversion, we would own an approximate 52% economic interest in Newco and Forbes’ existing stockholders would own an approximate 48% economic interest in Newco. 

The Combination has been unanimously approved by our and Forbes’ Boards of Directors as well as the special committee of the Board of Directors of Forbes. Newco filed a joint proxy statement/prospectus on February 12, 2020, pursuant to which Forbes will solicit proxies of its stockholders to approve the Combination at a special meeting of stockholders. However, certain stockholders of Forbes who will collectively own a majority of Forbes’ common stock on the record date for Forbes’ special meeting have committed to vote the shares they beneficially own in favor of the Combination and have the ability to approve the Combination without the vote of any other stockholder of Forbes.

Related Financing Transactions

As a condition of the Combination, SESI, L.L.C. (SESI), our wholly owned subsidiary, consummated an offer to exchange (the Exchange Offer) up to $635.0 million of SESI’s previously outstanding $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the Original Notes) for up to $635.0 million aggregate principal amount of SESI’s 7.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the New Notes) and conducted a concurrent consent solicitation (the Consent Solicitation) to amend the liens covenant in the indenture governing the Original Notes (the Original Notes Indenture) to permit the issuance of the Superior Secured Notes described below (the Proposed Amendment) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in SESI’s offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, 

 

dated as of January 6, 2020 (as amended by the press releases dated January 16, 2020, January 22, 2020, January 31, 2020, February 14, 2020, February 18, 2020, February 19, 2020, February 20, 2020 and February 24, 2020 issued by the Company and Supplement No. 1 to the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation, dated as of January 31, 2020 (the Offering Memorandum)). A supplemental indenture by and among SESI, the guarantors party thereto and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, related to the Proposed Amendment was executed on February 14, 2020. The Original Notes outstanding after the Exchange Offer are governed by the Original Notes Indenture, as amended by the Proposed Amendment, provided that the Proposed Amendment will only become operative immediately prior to the occurrence of the Combination.

The Exchange Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 21, 2020, and $617.9 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Original Notes were validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, representing 77.24% of the aggregate principal amount of Original Notes outstanding upon commencement of the Exchange Offer. SESI accepted all validly tendered Original Notes and issued $617.9 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes pursuant to an indenture dated February 24, 2020 by and among SESI, the guarantors party thereto and UMB Bank, N.A., as trustee (the New Notes Indenture). 

Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Combination, eligible note holders will receive, in exchange for $617.9 million aggregate principal amount of New Notes, on a pro rata basis: (1) $243.3 million aggregate principal amount of 9.750% Senior Second Lien Secured Notes due 2025 to be issued by Newco (the Newco Secured Notes), (2) $243.3 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750% Senior Second Lien Secured Notes due 2026 to be issued by SESI (the Superior Secured Notes), (3) $131.3 million in cash and (4) $6.35 million in cash constituting the total consent payment (the Combination Exchange). The indentures governing the Newco Secured Notes and the Superior Secured Notes will each contain restrictive covenants customary for issuances of high-yield secured notes of this type. On February 20, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement (the Amendment). The Amendment amends certain covenants, among other things, to account for the amended terms of the Exchange Offer.

Exit and Discontinuation of the Hydraulic Fracturing Service Line

On December 10, 2019, our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Pumpco Energy Services, Inc. (Pumpco), completed its existing hydraulic fracturing field operations, and we determined to discontinue, wind down and exit Pumpco’s hydraulic fracturing operations. We intend to maintain an adequate number of employees to efficiently wind down Pumpco’s business and divest Pumpco’s assets over time. The financial results of Pumpco’s operations have historically been included in our Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment. Pumpco’s business is reflected as discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and its assets are in the process of being divested. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations. Discontinuing hydraulic fracturing aligns with our strategic objective to divest assets and service lines that do not compete for investment in the current market environment. Net proceeds from the divestiture of Pumpco’s assets will be used to reduce debt.
Reverse Stock Split

At a special meeting of stockholders held on December 18, 2019, our stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing our Board of Directors to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split) and to proportionately reduce the number of our authorized shares of common stock. Following the special meeting of stockholders, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each 10 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split automatically were converted to one issued and outstanding share of common stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any stockholder who would have been entitled to a fractional share received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares. The total number of shares of common stock that the Company is authorized to issue has also been reduced by the same ratio.

Unless otherwise indicated, the number of shares of common stock outstanding and per-share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. The par value of our common stock remains at $0.001 per share.

Resumption of Trading on the New York Stock Exchange

On September 26, 2019, the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) suspended trading of our common stock and commenced delisting proceedings due to our “abnormally low” stock price. Following the NYSE’s suspension of trading of our common stock, we appealed the NYSE staff’s determination. On September 27, 2019, our common stock commenced trading on the OTC Markets and, on October 4, 2019, our common stock also commenced trading on the OTCQX Best Market, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. The NYSE formally withdrew the delisting determination, and, on December 26, 2019, our common stock resumed trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SPN.”
Products and Services

We offer a wide variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the products and services offered by each of our four segments is as follows:

Drilling Products and Services – Includes downhole drilling tools and surface rentals.

Downhole drilling tools – Includes rentals of tubulars, such as primary drill pipe strings, landing strings, completion tubulars and associated accessories, and manufacturing and rentals of bottom hole tools, including stabilizers, non-magnetic drill collars and hole openers.

Surface rentals – Includes rentals of temporary onshore and offshore accommodation modules and accessories.

Onshore Completion and Workover Services – Includes fluid management and workover services.

Fluid management – Includes services used to obtain, move, store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the exploration, development and production of oil and gas, including mobile piping systems, specialized trucks, fracturing tanks and other assets that transport, heat, pump and dispose of fluids.

Workover services – Includes a variety of well completion, workover and maintenance services, including installations, completions, sidetracking of wells and support for perforating operations.

Production Services – Includes intervention services.

Intervention services – Includes services to enhance, maintain and extend oil and gas production during the life of the well, including coiled tubing, cased hole and mechanical wireline, hydraulic workover and snubbing, pressure control services, production testing and optimization.

Technical Solutions – Includes products and services that generally address customer-specific needs with their applications, which typically require specialized engineering, manufacturing or project planning expertise. Most operations requiring our technical solutions are generally in offshore environments during the completion, production and decommissioning phase of an oil and gas well. These products and services primarily include completion tools and services, well control services and subsea well intervention. 

Completion tools and services – Provides products and services used during the completion phase of an offshore well to control sand and maximize oil and gas production, including sand control systems, well screens and filters, and surface-controlled sub surface safety valves.

Well control services – Resolves well control and pressure control problems through firefighting, engineering and well control training.

The Technical Solutions segment also includes revenues from oil and gas production related to our 51% ownership interest in our sole federal offshore oil and gas property (which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the oil and gas property) and related assets. 

Customers

Our customers are the major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in the geographic areas in which we operate. There were no customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenues in 2019, 2018 or 2017. A reduction in sales to our existing large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Competition 

We provide products and services worldwide in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small and large companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by weather and general economic conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services.
Potential Liabilities and Insurance 

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, well blowout or vessel loss, may result in substantial claims for damages. 

As is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Nonetheless, our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case.

We maintain a liability insurance program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which we are liable, but well control costs are not covered by this program.  These policies include primary and excess umbrella liability policies with limits of $350 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution incidents. All of the insurance policies we purchase contain specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions and are subject to either deductibles or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible.  There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of insurance we maintain will be sufficient to fully protect us against all liabilities related to our business.

Government Regulation 

Our business is significantly affected by Federal, State and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:

worker safety standards;

the protection of the environment;

the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; and

the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites.

Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our underground injection wells, trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.

We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.

Environmental Matters

Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
Raw Materials

We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials. 
Seasonality

Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations and reduce demand for our products and services. Examples of seasonal events that negatively affect our operations include high seas associated with cold fronts during the winter months and hurricanes during the summer months in the Gulf of Mexico, and severe cold during winter months in the U.S. land market area. 
Employees 

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,200 employees. Approximately 6% of our employees are subject to union contracts, all of which are in international locations. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
Facilities

Our principal executive offices are located at 1001 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas, 77002. We own or lease a large number of facilities in the various areas in which we operate throughout the world.
Intellectual Property 

We seek patent and trademark protections throughout the world for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents and trademarks are adequate for the conduct of our business, and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position.
