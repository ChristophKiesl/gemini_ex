Item 1. Business
Akamai provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. As a global leader in content delivery network, or CDN, services, our goal is to make the Internet fast, reliable and secure for our customers. 
Our Strategy – Addressing the Needs of our Customers in the Internet Age
The Internet plays a crucial role in the way companies, government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public, but the world around us is rapidly evolving. In recent years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the use of social media for sharing photos, videos and ideas. More consumers are "cutting the cord" and consuming entertainment over the Internet rather than through traditional cable. Web pages are more complex with advertisements, videos, graphics and other third party content, causing speed and reliability to suffer. Online transactions and media are increasingly moving to mobile devices. More and more, government agencies want citizens to pay their taxes, submit applications and request information online. Security threats have grown more complex and arise more frequently. Enterprise applications are moving from behind the firewall to the cloud. Smart enterprises want to take advantage of these trends safely, profitably and intelligently.
What our customers want to do:

• | provide consumers with superior online experiences when they access websites and applications from all types of devices from anywhere in the world;


• | handle transactions securely and protect sensitive information;


• | affordably present vibrant and engaging streaming content, including high definition, or HD, video, music and games;


• | leverage the growth in the use of mobile devices to reach more consumers and provide dynamic experiences;


• | scale and secure the enterprise network; and


• | receive data about usage of their websites and applications.

What makes it difficult to achieve those goals:

• | doing it yourself – building out data centers, coping with the technology changes, and dealing with sudden traffic spikes – is difficult and expensive;


• | lack of a coordinated security system to protect against hackers, bots and other malefactors that want to steal assets and disrupt the functioning of the web;


• | mobile networks tend to be slower and less reliable than the fixed line Internet and present other challenges;


• | traffic congestion at data centers and between networks;


• | it can be difficult to understand actual user experiences given myriad devices and locations; and


• | coping with “last mile” issues – such as bandwidth constraints between consumers and their Internet access provider.

Our Solutions
Performance and Security Solutions
Web and Mobile Performance Solutions
The ultimate goal of our web and mobile performance business is to make dynamic websites and applications have instant response times, no matter where the user is, what device or browser they are using, or how they are connected to the Internet. This is accomplished through a variety of advanced technologies embedded into our platform, which can be thought of as a virtual Internet overlaying the real Internet. Key offerings include:

• | Ion – Ion is a situational performance solution that consists of an integrated suite of web delivery, acceleration and optimization technologies that make real-time optimization decisions based on the requirements of the device, network location and browser. Ion is designed to simplify increasingly complex web delivery and enable a faster website experience that is highly available, secure and scalable to meet peak capacity demands.

based on real-time data center performance health and global Internet conditions to help ensure user requests are routed to the most appropriate data center for that user at that moment.

• | Image Manager – To help our customers cope with the multitude of devices used by their consumers and varying connection quality, Image Manager automatically optimizes online images for the best combination of size, quality, and file format suited for each image and device and offloads the artistic transformation of derivative assets to the cloud.


• | Cloudlets – Cloudlets are applications that provide our customers with self-serviceable controls and capabilities designed to help simplify web operations and improve user experiences. Examples include Visitor Prioritization for managing potentially overloaded applications, Image Converter to improve delivery of images particularly to mobile devices and IP/Geo Access to handle access restrictions.

Cloud Security Solutions
Our Cloud Security Solutions are designed to defend websites, applications and data centers against a multitude of cyber attacks through solutions such as:

• | Kona Site Defender – Kona Site Defender is a cloud computing security solution that defends against network and application layer distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, web application attacks and direct-to-origin attacks. By leveraging our distributed network and proprietary technology, Akamai can absorb traffic targeted at the application layer, deflect DDoS traffic targeted at the network layer, such as SYN Floods or UDP Floods, and authenticate valid traffic at the network edge.


• | Bot Manager – As websites attract users, they also place business information where it can be easily accessed by other entities – often using automated tools known as “bots.” Our Bot Manager offering provides organizations with a flexible framework to better manage the wide array of bots accessing their website every day. It offers the ability to identify bots as they first arrive, categorize different types of bots, and apply the most appropriate management policy for each category. 


• | Fast DNS – The Domain Name System, or DNS, translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses to enable individuals who type in a website name to reach the desired location on the Internet. Our Fast DNS offering is a DNS resolution solution that is designed to quickly and dependably direct individuals to our customers' websites. Importantly, we have architected this service to protect against DNS-based DDoS attacks. 


• | Prolexic Routed – Prolexic Routed is designed to protect web- and IP-based applications in data centers from the threat of DDoS attacks by preventing attacks before they reach the data center. It provides protection against high-bandwidth, sustained web attacks as well as potentially crippling DDoS attacks that target specific applications and services.


• | Client Reputation – Client Reputation provides an additional layer of protection against DDoS and web application attacks by allowing customers to automatically block requests from IP addresses. Client Reputation leverages advanced algorithms to compute a risk score based on prior behavior as observed over the Akamai network. The algorithms use both legitimate and attack traffic to profile the behavior of attacks, clients and applications. Based on this information, Akamai assigns risk scores to each IP address and allows customers to choose which actions they wish to have Kona Site Defender perform on an IP address with specific risk scores.

Enterprise Solutions
Our Enterprise offerings are designed to help customers boost productivity by facilitating third-party access to applications, accelerating those applications, reducing bandwidth costs and extending the Internet and public clouds into private wide area networks, or WANs. Our key enterprise solutions offerings include: 

• | Enterprise Application Access – Using technology gained through our acquisition of Soha Systems, Inc., this offering enables remote access to applications behind the firewall without providing users access to the entire network without external hardware or software.


• | Akamai Cloud Connect – By combining WAN optimization and intelligent caching directly into a Cisco router in enterprise branch locations, Akamai Connect extends the Akamai Intelligent Platform directly into the branch. The

solution is architected to enable customers to reduce costs while delivering high-quality application experiences with minimal bandwidth impact, regardless of device, connectivity or public/private cloud architectures.
Network Operator Solutions
With the growth in consumer adoption of Internet video and other media, carriers around the world have experienced significant traffic increases, resulting in congestion across networks from aggregation, to backbone, to interconnection. Our Network Operator offerings are designed to help carriers operate a cost-efficient network that capitalizes on traffic growth and new subscriber services by reducing the complexity of building a CDN and interconnecting access providers. Similarly, our Mobile Network Solutions address the need for tailored solutions to handle the unique complexities of using mobile networks to offer access to content and applications. These offerings include: 

• | Aura Licensed CDN – Aura Licensed CDN is a suite of solutions designed to empower network operators to build and run a highly-scalable media content delivery network that efficiently delivers its own content as well as content from Akamai customers and other targeted services, all utilizing a common HTTP caching infrastructure. The Aura Licensed CDN federates with the Akamai Intelligent Platform, providing global delivery of operator content with a single business agreement. The solution also includes HyperCache, a common HTTP caching layer in the network that supports traffic offload and delivery of content, and Request Router, a DNS-based content request router that directs user requests to an optimal available CDN node. 


• | Aura Managed CDN – Aura Managed CDN is a scalable, turnkey CDN solution designed to provide network operators with CDN capabilities through an infrastructure that is maintained by Akamai. With it, an operator can leverage the same CDN techniques used by Akamai, but on servers that are dedicated to the network operator's services. Operators can deliver multi-screen video services and large objects, plus offer commercial CDN services, relying on Akamai CDN experts and proven technology for content provisioning, delivery and reporting.


• | Intelligent DNS Solutions – Our AnswerX offering is an intelligent recursive DNS platform built for effective management of DNS traffic. To help make web services fast, safe and uniquely personal for subscribers, AnswerX manages subscriber preferences (e.g., opt-in or opt-out), tracks popular destinations and maintains lists of typo squatters (website addresses that are similar to popular ones but with misspelled names) and phishing domains. 

Media Delivery Solutions
In recent years, streaming of movies, television and live events has come to represent a significant percentage of traffic on the Internet. Providing solutions to handle that media is an important part of our current and future strategy.

Research and Development
Our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services, strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers' needs and market demand. As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,762 research and development employees. Our research and development expenses were $167.6 million, $148.6 million and $125.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts are net of capitalized costs related to the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $124.6 million, $105.7 million and $91.1 million, respectively, of payroll, payroll-related and external consulting costs related to the development of internal-use software. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $21.4 million, $16.7 million and $13.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation attributable to our research and development personnel.
Industry Segment and Geographic Information
We operate in one industry segment: providing cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. Our revenue derived from operations outside the U.S. was $720.0 million, $593.0 million and $531.9 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represented 31% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 27% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. No single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any such year. 
Our long-lived assets include servers, which are deployed into networks worldwide, in addition to other property and equipment used to support our operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $297.8 million and $231.8 million of net property and equipment, excluding internal-use software, located in the U.S. and foreign locations, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $298.9 million and $227.8 million of net property and equipment, excluding internal-use software, located in the U.S. and foreign locations, respectively.

No customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Six of our customers that are large Internet platform companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, or our Internet Platform Customers, in aggregate, accounted for 11%, 17% and 18% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Less than 10% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government, and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017.
Sales, Service and Marketing
We market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and service organization and through more than 250 active channel partners including AT&T, Deutsche Telecom, IBM, Orange Business Services and Telefonica Group. In addition to entering into agreements with resellers, we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators, application service providers, referral partners and sales agents. By aligning with these partners, we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry.
Our sales, service and marketing professionals are located in more than 60 offices in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia and focus on direct and channel sales, sales operations, professional services, account management and technical consulting. As of December 31, 2016, we had 3,153 employees in this organization. 
To support our sales efforts and promote the Akamai brand, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign, print advertisements, online advertisements, participation at trade shows, strategic alliances, ongoing customer communication programs, training and sales support.
Competition
The market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations. We expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:

• | the performance and reliability of our services;


• | return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers;


• | reduced infrastructure complexity;


• | sophistication and functionality of our offerings;


• | scalability;


• | security;


• | ease of implementation and use of service;


• | customer support; and


• | price.

We compete with companies offering products and services that address Internet performance problems, including companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting services, security solutions, technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems, streaming content delivery services and equipment-based solutions for Internet performance problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. In addition, existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware, software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externally-managed services like Akamai.
8

We believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the Akamai Intelligent Platform, which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us. In our view, we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings, our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value.
Proprietary Rights and Licensing
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2016, we owned, or had exclusive rights to, more than 265 U.S. patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries. Our U.S.-issued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2017 and 2034. We do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business. In October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a royalty-free, worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content delivery technology. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 6,490 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work.
