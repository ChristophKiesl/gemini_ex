 Item 1. Business
 General
 We are a specialty retailer of home décor in the United States. As of January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 373 stores in 35 states as well as an e-commerce website, www.kirklands.com. We were founded in 1966, and our current parent corporation, Kirkland’s, Inc., was incorporated in 1981. Our stores present a curated selection of distinctive merchandise, including holiday décor, furniture, textiles, wall décor, decorative accessories, art, mirrors, fragrances and other home decorating items. Our stores offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise during seasonal periods. We provide our customers an engaging shopping experience characterized by affordable home décor and inspirational design ideas. This combination of quality and stylish merchandise, value pricing and a stimulating online and store experience allow our customer to furnish their home on a budget.
Business Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leading specialty retailer of value home décor and furnishings in our market. We believe the following elements of our business strategy both differentiate us from our competitors and position us for growth.
 Product development. Our strategy is to be seen as a home décor store for the complete home furnishing project, in addition to the finishing touches. Our stores contain items covering a range of complementary product categories, and we are known for traditionally-styled, casual decorating merchandise and our seasonal items. We have improved the quality and relevancy of our existing products and added new product categories to our mix including larger furniture pieces, tabletop, rugs and bedding as we aim to be a complete home furnishing brand and not just an accessories store. Our strategy of providing a combination of style, quality and value is an important element in making Kirkland’s a destination store. While we carry items online and in our stores that sell for various price points, our items are perceived by our customers as affordable home décor and accessories.
 Omni-channel. Our strategy includes improving omni-channel via website enhancements, more focused digital marketing spending, an expanded online assortment and an in-store experience that is aligned with our omni-channel capabilities. Our stores provide an engaging shopping experience for our customers by making them feel welcome and “at home” while providing inspiring decorative ideas. In addition to our stores, we sell direct-to-customer and facilitate orders for in-store pickup through our buy online and pickup in store (“BOPIS”) and ship-to-store programs on our website at www.kirklands.com. We view our e-commerce channel as a crucial part of our overall business strategy, allowing us to introduce our concept to new customers and complement our “brick-and-mortar” business for a true omni-channel brand experience.
 Customer experience. Our strategy to improve the customer experience leverages our lean infrastructure to be more nimble in our response to changes in consumer preferences and buying behaviors. We have redesigned our loyalty program, added extended credit options and broadened delivery options for our customers. We plan to pursue additional customer experience improvements based on changing consumer preferences.
 Merchandising
 Our merchandising strategy is to offer a curated assortment of quality, relevant home décor merchandise for customers to furnish their entire home on a budget. We maintain a value pricing strategy with affordable prices representing a great value to our customers along with “better” and “best” options. We emphasize merchandise quality and are focused on introducing and refining new product categories including furniture, upholstery, rugs, tabletop and bedding that complement our established categories where we are introducing fresher products and adding stronger points of view.
 Daily review of sales and product margin information helps us to maximize the productivity of successful products and categories, and minimize the accumulation of slow-moving inventory. We regularly monitor the sell-through of our merchandise; therefore, the number and make-up of our active items is continuously changing based 
 4

on changes in selling trends. The composition of our merchandise assortment is relatively consistent across our store base.
 We continually strive to increase the perceived value of Kirkland’s products to our customers through our distinctive merchandising, exclusive proprietary products, carefully coordinated in-store signage and visual presentation. Our shoppers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for items similar to those sold by other retailers. We use temporary promotions throughout the year featuring specific items or categories of merchandise along with entire transaction discounts. We believe our value-oriented pricing strategy, coupled with an adherence to high quality standards, is an important element in establishing our distinct brand identity and solidifying our connection with our customers.
 Our merchandise categories include holiday décor, furniture, textiles, ornamental wall décor, decorative accessories, art, mirrors, fragrance and accessories, lamps, artificial floral products, housewares, outdoor living items, gifts and frames. The following table presents the percentage of net sales contributed by our merchandise categories based on our current category structure over the last three fiscal years:
 
 
 | % of Net Sales |

Merchandise Category | Fiscal 2020 | | | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018

Frames | | 1 | | | 2 | | 2 | 
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Purchasing and Inventory Management
 Our merchandise team purchases inventory on a centralized basis to take advantage of our consolidated buying power and our technology to closely control the merchandise mix in our stores and online. Our buying team selects all of our products, negotiates with vendors and works with our planning and allocation team to optimize merchandise quantity and mix by category in our stores and on our website. We purchase merchandise from approximately 200 vendors, with only one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2020. Approximately 80 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2020.
 Approximately 76% of our total merchandise purchases are products manufactured in China with the remainder mainly from domestic manufacturers, India or Vietnam. We continue to monitor the impact of tariffs on products that we source from China and adjust our strategies to mitigate any negative impact, including negotiating with our vendors, seeking alternative sourcing options and adjusting retail selling prices. For our purchases of merchandise manufactured abroad, we have historically bought from importers or U.S.-based representatives of foreign manufacturers rather than contracting directly with foreign manufacturers. As part of our key strategic initiatives, we implemented a direct sourcing program in fiscal 2019, which allows us to purchase some of our merchandise directly from manufacturers in an effort to lower the cost of merchandise purchases and improve the design and quality of our merchandise. Direct sourcing accounted for approximately 20% of our purchases in fiscal 2020. We plan to increase the percentage of merchandise that we directly source from manufactures, targeting 40% to 50% of total merchandise purchases over the next two to three years.

Our merchandise planning and allocation team manages inventory levels, allocates merchandise to stores and e-commerce and replenishes inventory. Our inventory control systems monitor current inventory levels at each store and distribution center location. We also continually monitor recent selling history within each store and on our website by category, classification and item to properly allocate future purchases to maximize sales and gross margin. Each of our stores is internally classified for merchandising purposes based on certain criteria including sales volume, size, location and historical performance. Although our stores carry similar merchandise, the variety and depth of products in a given store may vary depending on the store’s rank and classification. Where applicable, inventory purchases and allocation are also tailored based on regional or demographic differences between stores in selected categories. On our website, we carry a larger selection of merchandise than in our store locations, including online-exclusive items.
 Store Operations
 General. In addition to corporate management, three regional directors and 17 district managers (who generally have responsibility for an average of 22 stores within a geographic district) manage store operations. Store managers and assistant managers are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including sales, customer service, merchandise display, human resource functions and store security. A typical store operates seven days a week with an average of 8 to 14 employees, including a combination of full and part-time employees, depending on the volume of the store and the season. Additional part-time employees are typically hired to assist with the increased traffic and sales volume in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.
 Merchandise presentation. Our strategy is to present merchandise in a visually appealing manner to create an engaging shopping experience that inspires home decorating. Merchandise is displayed according to placement guidelines and directives given to stores by the merchandise presentation team. This process promotes uniform display standards throughout our stores depending upon multiple store configurations. Using multiple types of fixtures, products are displayed by category or product type or complementary merchandise is creatively grouped together.
 Real Estate
 As part of our store optimization strategy, which includes exiting unprofitable stores and continuing to reduce the store base over the next several years, we closed 59 store locations in fiscal 2020. We are prioritizing sustained improvement in overall profitability and developing a future state plan for infrastructure that complements our omni-channel concept and improves the customer experience. We anticipate additional store closures and limited store openings as we execute our store optimization strategy over the next few years. We believe our ideal store count should be in the range of 300 to 350 stores.
 As of January 30, 2021, we operated 373 stores, including 318 “power” strip or “lifestyle” centers, 27 freestanding locations, 14 mall locations and 14 outlet centers. 
 The following table provides a history of our store openings and closings for the last five fiscal years:
 
 
 | Fiscal 2020 | | | Fiscal 2019 | | Fiscal 2018 | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2015 | 
-----------------------------------+-------------+-----+---+-------------+-----+-------------+-------------+---+-------------+----
Stores open at beginning of period | | 432 | | | 428 | | 418 | | | 404 | | 376 | 
Store openings | | — | | | 5 | | 25 | | | 31 | | 42 | 
Store closings | | (59 | ) | | (1 | ) | (15 | ) | | (17 | ) | (14 | )
Stores open at end of period | | 373 | | | 432 | | 428 | | | 418 | | 404 | 

Distribution and Logistics
 We have a comprehensive approach to the management of our merchandise supply chain. We continuously evaluate the impact of our omni-channel strategies on our business, and frequently implement enhancements to our supply chain infrastructure and warehouse management system to support store and e-commerce fulfillment.
 6

Our main retail distribution center in Jackson, Tennessee services approximately 75% of our stores. In fiscal 2019, we began using a third-party operated retail fulfillment facility in Lancaster, Texas which services the other 25% of our stores. In fiscal 2020, we closed our separate e-commerce order fulfillment center in Jackson, Tennessee and consolidated e-commerce order fulfilment into our main Jackson, Tennessee retail distribution center. We also opened two new smaller e-commerce order fulfillment centers in North Las Vegas, Nevada and Winchester, Virginia in order to reduce the time to deliver customer orders, fixed costs and shipping expenses. We also have a third-party operated west coast distribution operation, which provides for the improved flow of merchandise through our supply chain network. By virtue of this operation, we gain control of merchandise when it enters the west coast port, which allows us to allocate and distribute inventory directly to any of our four retail or e-commerce fulfillment distribution centers.
 We upgraded our internal warehouse management system in fiscal 2020 to provide increased functionality that supports e-commerce fulfillment at our e-commerce fulfillment locations. We plan to upgrade our internal warehouse management system related to store fulfillment at our Jackson, Tennessee location in fiscal 2021.
 We currently utilize third-party carriers to transport merchandise from our Jackson, Tennessee and Lancaster, Texas distribution centers to our stores. Almost all of our stores utilize direct, full truckload deliveries, which results in lower distribution costs and allows our field personnel to better schedule store associates for the receiving process. 
 Information Systems
 We have invested considerable resources in our management information systems to manage the purchase, pricing and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations. Our key management information systems include a merchandise management system, point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, an e-commerce order management system, a warehouse management system, a financial system and a labor management tool. Our merchandise management system provides us with tools to manage aspects of our merchandise assortment and integrates all merchandising and inventory management applications including inventory tracking, purchase order management, merchandise financial planning, allocation, and replenishment and sales audit and ultimately interfaces with our financial system.
 We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance. We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements. We continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store, distribution facility and omni-channel expansion. These efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, implementing new features and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.
 Marketing
 Kirkland’s is a brand with an emotionally-based tagline, Bring Happiness Home.  Our marketing communicates that Kirkland’s is a home shopping destination that offers stylish, quality merchandise at a value to our customers. We believe a happy home is a beautiful home, and our marketing showcases our products in casual, inviting and realistic lifestyle settings that are inspirational and attainable.
 Our marketing strategy includes a balanced approach to customer retention and acquisition. Our overall marketing efforts encompass various techniques including digital marketing, paid search and social media initiatives. We manage a database of customers and communicate with them via targeted emails and seasonal direct mail catalogs featuring new products, marketing events and special offers.
 We are focused on improving the customer experience through our loyalty program, K-club, and our private label credit card financing. We redesigned our customer loyalty program in October 2020. Our new program rewards 
 7

customers for shopping with us, as well as interacting with Kirkland's across channels. This allows us to foster stronger and lasting relationships with our customers. The key benefits of the new program include:
  
• | Points on every purchase to redeem for valuable rewards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Birthday surprises;
--+--------------------


• | Special offers, bonus days, annual bonuses and exclusive access;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monthly $500 sweepstakes entry; and
--+------------------------------------


• | VIP shopping hours.
--+--------------------

 We also enhanced our private label Kirkland’s credit card through Wells Fargo in January 2021 by offering new financing options including "6-months no interest" and "12-months no interest" financing for purchases over $250 and $500, respectively. 
 Omni-Channel
 We connect with our customers in their manner of choosing, whether that is in-store, on our website, email, social media, direct mail or through our customer service center. Our goal is to be available anytime, anywhere and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand and present a consistent and appealing shopping experience across our channels. Customers may use our website as a resource to purchase merchandise, locate a store, preview our merchandise, join our K-club loyalty program, apply for a Kirkland’s credit card and purchase gift cards online. 
 We have multiple online fulfillment options, including delivery to the customer’s home directly from our warehouse, store or directly from the vendor, ship-to-store and buy online and pickup in store programs. Our BOPIS program includes optional curbside pickup implemented in fiscal 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which provides convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations without leaving their vehicle. In fiscal 2020, we also introduced next-day delivery where customers can buy online out of store inventory, and we arrange to have a third-party deliver the merchandise the next day from the local store to the customer’s home.
 As part of our omni-channel growth strategy, we plan to focus on improving comparable sales performance, driven by e-commerce growth. We expect e-commerce to grow as a percentage of our total business, but also intend to focus on improving the contribution of our remaining store base, which is an integral part of our omni-channel strategy and supports improved profitability of our e-commerce business.
 We expect to continue to focus on customer site experience improvements including checkout and search engine improvements, integration improvements and other personalization and product page improvements.
 Trademarks
 All of our stores operate under the names “Kirkland’s”, “Kirkland’s Home”, “Kirkland’s Home Outlet”, “Kirkland’s Outlet,” and “The Kirkland Collection.”
 We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register that are used in connection with the Kirkland’s stores, including KIRKLAND’S® logo design, KIRKLAND’S®, THE KIRKLAND COLLECTION®, KIRKLAND’S OUTLET®, KIRKLAND’S HOME®, MARKET AND VINE™, SIMPLE THINGS BY KIRKLAND’S®, LOVE THE POSSIBILITIES and LOVE THE PRICE®. These marks have historically been important components in our merchandising and marketing strategy. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States.
Competition
 The retail market for home décor is highly competitive. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Some of our main competitors include HomeGoods, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, At Home, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. We believe that the principal competitive factors influencing our business are merchandise selection, price, customer service, visual appeal of our stores and our convenient store locations. We 
 8

believe we compete effectively with other retailers due to our experience in identifying a curated collection of quality and stylish merchandise, pricing it to be attractive to our target customer, presenting it in a visually appealing manner and providing an engaging shopping experience.
 In addition to competing for customers, we compete with other retailers for suitable store locations and qualified management personnel and sales associates. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K, captioned “Risk Factors” for further discussion of our competitive environment.
 Human Capital
 Overview. We employed approximately 1,000 full-time and 3,700 part-time employees as of January 30, 2021. The number of employees fluctuates with seasonal needs. We generally experience our highest level of employment during the fourth fiscal quarter. Of our 4,700 employees, approximately 4,250 work at stores, 250 work at our distribution centers and 200 work in corporate support functions. As of January 30, 2021, none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a positive relationship with our employees.
 Personnel recruitment and training. We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate quality employees. In particular, our success depends on our ability to promote and recruit qualified corporate personnel, distribution center employees, district and store managers and full-time and part-time store employees. District managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new store managers, while store managers are responsible for the hiring and training of store employees. We constantly look for motivated and talented people to promote from within the Company, in addition to recruiting outside of Kirkland’s. All store employees are trained utilizing the “K University” training program. Store managers train at a designated “training store” where they work directly with a qualified training store manager. District managers onboard at our corporate office in addition to spending time with designated district manager trainers. Corporate and distribution center employees receive training at their respective locations.
 Compensation and benefits. We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to our employees. Corporate management, distribution center leadership, regional directors, district managers and store managers are compensated with base pay plus periodic bonuses based on performance. Store and distribution center non-management employees are compensated on an hourly basis in addition to periodic contests and rewards. Many of our employees participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon department or Company performance. We also provide our eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan which includes a 100% Company match of the employee’s elective bi-weekly contributions up to 4% of eligible compensation. We share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible employees, and we offer our employees a discount on merchandise purchased from our stores.
 Safety. Employee safety is a top priority. We develop and administer company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented numerous safety measures including adding work from home flexibility for corporate employees, adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home, increasing cleaning protocols, implementing temperature screenings of employees, establishing social distancing procedures, providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies, modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers, limiting travel and requiring masks to be worn in accordance with CDC guidelines and local ordinances. We have also implemented regular communications to employees regarding the impacts of COVID-19, new health and safety procedures and protocols to address actual or suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure.
 Diversity. Our leadership team is comprised of our CEO, CFO and eight vice presidents who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business areas including omni-channel operations, finance, supply chain, legal, merchandising, human resources, marketing and information technology. Our leadership team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning the Company’s human capital assets including its capability development, succession planning and diversity. Accordingly, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions, to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. With respect to diverse 
 9

representation, presently three of the ten members of our leadership team are women. We are committed to our continued efforts to promote diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the communities we serve. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or other protected traits, and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and tax. In addition, we must comply with United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import of our merchandise. Ensuring our compliance with these various laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our industry, requires us to expend considerable resources. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” under the sub-captions “Risks Relate to Strategy and Execution” and “Risks Related to New Legislation, Regulation, and Litigation.”
 Seasonality
 We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results. We believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and expect that this pattern will continue in the future. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year.
COVID-19 Response
 The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility which materially affected our business operations in fiscal 2020. If the pandemic persists throughout fiscal 2021 or worsens, it could continue to impact our business operations. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all facets of our business, which includes the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, business partners and supply chain networks.
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as a proactive and cautionary measure, we elected to borrow $40.0 million from our revolving credit facility, which was later repaid during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We also temporarily closed all of our stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and reopened stores during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently operate in the pandemic during the first half of the year, we reduced store and corporate payroll, inventory receipts, advertising expenses, outbound freight expense, capital expenditures and other expenses. We also implemented a new curbside pickup option for customers at our stores.
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law during our first fiscal quarter. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act allowed our net operating losses incurred in 2019 to be carried back to preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes of approximately $12.3 million. We also have a $1.4 million employer tax credit receivable from the IRS, and we have deferred $3.3 million in employer payroll taxes that we plan to repay in October 2021.
 All of our stores and distribution centers are currently open with enhanced safety measures. The health and safety of our employees and customers are the primary concerns of our management team. We have taken and continue to take numerous actions to promote health and safety, including, providing personal protective equipment to our employees, establishing mask protocols in our facilities, rolling out additional functionality to support contactless shopping experiences, implementing additional cleaning and sanitation procedures and promoting social distancing.
