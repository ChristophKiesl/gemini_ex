ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
Ever Harvest International Group Inc. (f/k/a Totally Green Inc.) is a holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in the development and sale of STEAM education products and services aimed at serving the primary and secondary school markets. Our Edtech business is operated through our wholly owned subsidiary K I.T. Network Limited, a Hong Kong private limited company (“KIT”). KIT commenced operations in Hong Kong in August 9, 2016 and sells its products and services primarily in Hong Kong. KIT is not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. KIT was organized as a private limited liability company on November 8, 2010, in Hong Kong and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ever Harvest Capital Group Limited (“EHCG”). Our corporate organization chart is below.
 

We are not a Chinese operating company but a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiary and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Further, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors, and the resulting adverse change in value to our common stock. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
 
Additionally, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our business operations in Hong Kong, which is subject to political and economic influence from China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and we face the risk that changes in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in Hong Kong and the profitability of such business. Therefore, these risks associated with being based in or having the majority of our operations in Hong Kong could would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Furthermore, these risks would likely result in a material change in our business operations or a complete hinderance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement, The business of our subsidiary are not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that: (i) our products and services are offered not directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations.. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong” in the Form 10..

We reported a net loss of $2,237,346 and $512 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had current assets of $7,504 and current liabilities of $81,473 as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our current assets and current liabilities were $123,060 and $22,797, respectively. We have prepared our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and short-term and long-term debts.
 
We believe that we will require approximately $1 million in the next twelve months to sustain our operations and an additional $2 million for the subsequent twelve month period to sustain our operations and implement our business plan.
 
We are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through a number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.
 
History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 6, 2002, under the name Chieflive, Inc. The name was changed to Naturally Iowa, Inc. on July 26, 2007, to Totally Green, Inc. on September 22, 2010, and to its current name, Ever Harvest International Group Inc. on October 14, 2021.
 
The Company posted periodic reports on the OTCMarkets website under the alternative reporting standard from September 2007 to August 2015 with the 6/30/2015 Quarterly Report being the last report. Thereafter, the Company ceased reporting and went “dark.” The Company failed to file its Annual list due in September 2019 with the Nevada Secretary of State. This resulted in the revocation of the Company’s corporate charter.
 
In December, 2020, Barbara McIntyre Bauman in her capacity as a stockholder of the Company applied for custodianship of the Company with the District Court sitting in Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”) to revive the Company. Ms. Bauman was ultimately appointed by the Court to serve as custodian of the Company on February 16, 2021. A copy of the court records relating to the application of custodianship of the Company are attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10.
 
In connection with serving as the custodian, Ms. Bauman was appointed to serve as the sole executive officer and director of the Company effective February 16, 2021. As custodian, Ms. Bauman returned the Company to Good Standing Status with the Nevada Secretary of State and caused the Company to re-commence posting periodic reports on the OTCMarkets website under the alternative reporting standard. On 5/5/2021, the Company issued to Ms. Bauman 150,000,000 shares of common stock for repayment of related party debt totaling $5,038. The debt was incurred in connection with reviving and maintaining the Company. On April 15, 2021, Ms. Bauman’s motion to terminate custodianship of the Company was granted by the Court. A copy of the court records relating to the termination of custodianship is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 10.
 
On May 18, 2021, Ms. Bauman sold 150,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to CHEN Xiaofeng for aggregate consideration of Three Hundred Forty Thousand ($340,000). In connection with the sale of Ms. Bauman’s securities, Ms. Bauman resigned from all of her positions with the Company and appointed Chi Tong AU to serve as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Director and Parkson Tak Yin YIP as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. It is our understanding that the purchaser is not a U.S. Person within the meaning of Regulations S. Accordingly, the shares are being sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder.

On October 14, 2021, we changed our name to Ever Harvest International Group Inc. Our securities are currently quoted on other Expert Market. 
 
Acquisition of K.I. T. Network Limited, Our Edtech Business
 
On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ever Harvest Capital Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands limited liability company (“EHCG”), from YANG Huichun and LEE Wai Hong Alex, EHCG’s sole shareholders, in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock. The acquisition of EHCG consummated on October 28, 2021. In connection with the EHCG’s acquisition, Ms. YANG was appointed to serve as our director. In The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated under the Act in selling the Company’s securities to the shareholders of EHCG. EHCG is a holding company that operates an Edtech company through its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, K.I.T. Network Limited, or KIT.
 
Prior to the acquisition, the Company was considered as a shell company due to its nominal assets and limited operation. Upon the acquisition, EHCG will comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity and its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity, EHCG is deemed to be the accounting acquirer for accounting purposes. The transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company will become the historical financial statements of EHCG at acquisition date. EHCG was the legal acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The Company was the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (EHCG). Historical stockholders’ equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the merger are retroactively restated (a recapitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the merger. Operations prior to the merger are those of the acquirer. After completion of the share exchange transaction, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities, the operations and cash flow of the accounting acquirer.
 
In order to have further expand in China, we intend to make additional acquisitions in the same industry, and if opportunities arise, in other industries, in the future. Accordingly, we do not expect to engage in a name change in the near future. 
 
Market Overview
 
Our Business
 
We are a holding company that, through our subsidiaries, is engaged primarily in the development and sale of STEAM education products and services aimed at serving the primary and secondary school markets. These products are considered optional and supplemental to the core and compulsory academic education in Hong Kong. We do not offer teaching or tutoring services, whether for core or extracurricular subject matters, and we do not operate schools, education or training centers and the like. Rather, we focus solely on the sale of books and educational materials designed to support educators. As such, we are not subject to the Guidelines for Further Easing the Burden of Excessive Homework and Off-campus Tutoring for Students at the Stage of Compulsory Education that was released on July 24, 2021, by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council.
 
Our products and services are provided through an online platform that is accessed through a tablet application. Our online education platform uses curriculum developed through the support of Chinese history teachers and professors of famous universities in Hong Kong and China and are marketed as teaching aides for the classroom teacher. Our online education platform features embedded Augmented Reality, 360 degree video, animation and interactive content. Our online education platform has already been adopted by over 40% of Hong Kong secondary schools. In the next 12-18 months, we hope to develop new versions of existing products, as well as launching new products covering additional subject matter to target the Asia and China markets.

Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of the foregoing. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We believe that we will need approximately an additional $2 million for the subsequent 12 month period to support our operations and implement our business plan.
 
Research and Development
 
We internally design and develop applications and software, with the programming and coding functions performed by third party contractors. We expect to continue to design, develop and offer innovative STEAM education products and programs, with third parties engaged to program and code.
 
We have developed the first augmented reality (AR) education platform in Hong Kong. The first product of our AR platform was Chinese history AR and offered through iPad apps. Our app has been purchased by approximately 50% of Hong Kong’s secondary schools.
 
In 2016, we built a Robotic study platform. Through our Robotic study platform, students can learn how to build a robot from scratch. We have been operating this platform with primary and secondary schools for 4 years and over hundreds of schools have chosen to use our Robotic study platform to teach their students how to build robots.
 
Sales and Marketing.
 
Schools in Hong Kong receive education grants from the government to develop STEAM education programs. We believe these grants enable schools to consider using our products to facilitate teaching STEAM. We market our products and services to elementary and secondary schools through events, and through the personal relationships of our management team. We consider our products to be teaching aides to assist classroom teachers in teaching STEAM materials.
 In the near future, we intend to establish strategic partnerships and may consider franchising opportunities in connection with our expansion into the Asia markets.

There were no major vendors for the years ended December 31, 2020.
 
Seasonality.
 
Although education in Hong Kong, and around the world, is a seasonal business, our products can be selling throughout the whole year. During the academic months, schools buy our services for classroom study and activities. During summer holiday, schools facilitate summer exchange programs and class program planning for the coming academic year, continue to provide us with business opportunities.
Insurance
 
We maintain certain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices in Hong Kong. Under Hong Kong law it is a requirement that all employers in the city must purchase Employee's Compensation Insurance to cover their liability in the event that their staff suffers an injury or illness during the normal course of their work. We maintain Employee’s Compensation Insurance, vehicle insurance and third party risks insurance for the business purposes.
CORPORATE INFORMATION
 
Our principal executive and registered offices are located at Suite F, 16/F, Cameron Plaza, 23 Cameron Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, telephone number +852 2732 0018.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We have developed our software library for project and product development, and we also have our own learning materials IPs.
 
We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.

In addition, the laws of Hong Kong and the PRC may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and China where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings..
 
 We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.  
 
COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price and service. We do not see a major direct competitor who operates in exactly the same market coverage, but we do have individual competitors in different product and services area.
 
In the robotic market, the global toy developer LEGO provides their robotic building bricks with a higher costs. Our locally developed robot kit provides a more cost effective and localized support for the students, with more flexibilities and less limitation in the programming interfaces.
 
In the AR platform market, the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company Ltd (“HKEP”) is selling their platform at as low as 10% of our prices, but our market shares still double from HKEP.
 
We may in the future compete against major regional STEAM development companies, if they elect to expand our market into the Asia countries. Some of our current and prospective competitors have greater financial resources, broader product and service offerings, longer operating histories, larger customer base and greater brand recognition, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enable them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We believe that we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including market experiences, business model, operational capabilities, pricing and service quality. 
 
We are currently operating with 5 staff, including corporate officers.

We have the following full time or part-time employees located in Hong Kong as set forth below:
 

Executive officers | 2
-------------------+--
Operations | 3
Total | 5

 
We are required to contribute to the MPF for all eligible employees in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and sixty five. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participant’s income based on their ages and wage level. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the MPF contributions by us were $2,888 and $1,934, respectively. We have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Our business is located in Hong Kong and is subject to the laws and regulations of Hong Kong governing businesses concerning, in particular labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. Furthermore, we need to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong governing the data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers or clients. As the information of our potential customers or clients is preserved in Hong Kong, we need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.
 
If PRC authorities reinterpret PRC laws to apply to Hong Kong companies, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire any other PRC companies, establish VIEs in the PRC, or make dividend payments from any future WFOEs to us.
 
Hong Kong.
 
Currently, STEAM education is not included in the regular academic educational programs in Hong Kong. There are no specific regulations in Hong Kong purporting to regulate non-academic educational programs, such as STEAM. Although funding support for extra-curriculum programs has been provided to schools, schools are not required to spend on any of the STEAM programs. While the current market remains unregulated, Hong Kong may in the future regulate the Edtech market. Such additional regulations may affect our business plans, operations and results of operations in the form of increased compliance costs, market limitations, foreign ownership limitations or any other limitations as may be imposed by the government.
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.

An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are $911 and $3,851 respectively.
 
China
 
China has recently imposed new stringent regulations affecting the private education industry. The new rules include requiring tutoring and education services firms to convert to nonprofit status, banning core-curriculum tutoring—aimed at passing exams—during weekends and vacations, and forbidding foreign curricula or hiring foreigners outside of China to teach remotely. These new regulations mainly affected tutoring institutions operating outside of the academic educational system.
 
STEAM developers like us are considered an educational tools provider, whereby we provide STEAM education tools to schools that are operating within the academic education system. We do not operate our own non-academic educational institutes. Accordingly, we do not expect China’s new laws regarding the private education industry to materially affect our industry.
 
China may at any time and with little advance notice elect to impose such regulations on Hong Kong and businesses located in Hong Kong in the future. Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing private education and businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to TLGN.

PRC Regulations on Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “EIT Law”) was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.
 
The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.

In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.
 
Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.
 
In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.
 
On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.
 
Value-added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, or the VAT Regulations, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the People’s Republic of China are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling services of transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction and lease of immovable, selling immovable, transferring land use rights, selling and importing other specified goods including fertilizers; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.

PRC Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 
 
General Administration of Foreign Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, Renminbi is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13
 
Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.
 
If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.
 
Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.
 
We cannot assure that our PRC beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.

Circular 19 and Circular 16
 
Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.
 
Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:
 

· | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.
 
Our PRC subsidiaries' distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.
 
PRC Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.

Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset.
