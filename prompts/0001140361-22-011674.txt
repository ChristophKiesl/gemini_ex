ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
Community West Bancshares, a California corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or “BHCA,” with corporate headquarters in Goleta, California.  CWBC's common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the trading symbol "CWBC". CWBC's principal business is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary Community West Bank, N.A. ("CWB"), a national banking association chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  Through CWB, the Company provides a variety of financial products and services to clients through seven full-service branch offices in the cities of Goleta, Oxnard, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Ventura, California.
 
The Company’s operations and financial results in 2021 and 2020 were influenced by the COVID-19 global pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic”, or “the pandemic”).  Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock and fixed income markets, a 150-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”), and a variety of rulings from the Company’s banking regulators.  Previously, the California governor issued a stay-at-home order which limited gatherings and travel and required workers who were not necessary to sustain or protect life to work from or stay at home.  Although those orders have been lifted, the impact of COVID-19 has led to financial stress for many businesses and workers throughout the communities we serve.

In response, the Company updated operating protocols to ensure all banking services continued while prioritizing the health and safety of clients and associates. The branch lobbies remained opened to service clients utilizing the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.  Many of our sales associates, support teams and management worked remotely.  In addition, the Company enhanced remote, mobile and online processes.
 
To assist clients during the pandemic, the Company implemented distinct COVID-19 relief programs to provide payment deferrals, fee waivers, and suspension of residential property foreclosures. The Company also actively monitored the actions of federal and state governments to proactively assist clients and ensure awareness of each financial assistance program available.
 
The Bank successfully deployed resources to handle client requests in response to the passage of the CARES Act, the establishment of the Paycheck Protection Program and the approval of the Consolidated Appropriations Act.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 93 active PPP loans with $21.3 million in remaining balances.
    These programs, could mask or delay the detection or reporting of deterioration in credit quality indicators. The industries most heavily impacted include retail, healthcare, hospitality, schools and energy. The Company’s management team has evaluated the loans related to the affected industries, and at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank’s loans to these industries, in the aggregate were $158.4 million and $179.2 million, respectively, representing 17.8% and 20.9%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio.
 
The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments.  Future developments include new information which may emerge concerning new strains of COVID-19 and the on-going actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.   The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets.

The Company’s vision is to be recognized as an outstanding financial services company creating remarkable experiences for its clients, shareholders and communities.

Talent acquisition
 The Company’s demand for qualified candidates grows as the Company’s business grows.  Building a diverse and inclusive workforce is a critical component of the Company’s plan.  The Company utilizes a workforce analysis model in its Affirmative Action Plan to analyze the composition of the workforce and identify any areas of underutilization or opportunity for inclusion of women, minorities, veterans and the disabled.  The Company actively recruits in venues identified to have significant populations of candidates who are female or from underrepresented categories.  The Company also posts all jobs in the State CalJobs career site, which promotes employment opportunities specifically to veterans and those with disabilities.  The Company attracts talented individuals with a combination of competitive pay and benefits.  Through systematic talent management, career development and succession planning the Company is striving to source a larger percentage of candidates internally and develop systems of career planning and growth that are attractive to external candidates.
 
Professional Development
 The Company’s performance management program is an interactive practice that engages employees through quarterly check-ins, mid-year and annual reviews and annual goal setting for achievement of both Company and individual goals.  The Company offers a variety of programs to help employees learn new skills, establish and meet personalized development goals, take on new roles and become better leaders.

Employee Engagement
 The Company recognizes that employees who are involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to their work and workplace contribute meaningfully to the success of the Company.  On a regular basis, the Company solicits employee feedback through a confidential company-wide survey on culture, management, career opportunities, compensation and benefits.  The results of this survey are reviewed with management and are used to update employee programs, initiatives and communications.  The Company has a number of other engagement initiatives including town hall meetings with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders.  The Company supports and empowers the grassroots “Elevate” Committee, composed of entry to mid-level employees from all departments and branches, and the Leadership Committee, comprised of both emerging and senior level leaders across all divisions.
Succession Planning

We offer health savings and spending accounts, paid parental leave and assistance with childcare expenses.  Throughout the pandemic, we have remained focused on providing a safe work environment, making structural changes to the workplace, and adhering to governmental mandates and guidance while implementing protocols to protect our employees, including the option for certain employees to work from home.

Manufactured Housing
 
The Company has a financing program for manufactured housing to provide affordable home ownership.  These loans are offered in approved mobile home parks throughout California primarily on or near the coast.  The parks must meet specific criteria. The manufactured housing loans are secured by the manufactured home and are retained in the Company’s loan portfolio.
Agricultural Loans for Real Estate and Operating Lines
 
The Company has an agricultural lending program for agricultural land, agricultural operational lines, and agricultural term loans for crops, equipment and livestock.  These loan products are partially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Farm Service Agency (“FSA”), and the USDA Business and Industry loan program.  The FSA typically issues a 90% guarantee up to $1,825,000 (amount adjusted annually based on inflation) for up to 40 years.
 
The Company also originates and sells loans to the secondary market through the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ("Farmer Mac") program.  Farmer Mac provides the Company with access to flexible, low-cost financing and effective risk management tools to help farm, ranch and rural utility customers.

Small Business Administration Lending
 
CWB has been a preferred lender/servicer of loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) since 1990. The Company originates SBA loans which can be sold into the secondary market.  The Company continues to service these loans after sale and is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts.  The primary SBA loan program that CWB offers is the Section 504 (“504”) program.
 
CWB also offers Business & Industry ("B & I") loans. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The maximum guaranteed amount is 80%.  B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally larger loans to larger businesses than the 7(a) loans.  Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market.
 
As a Preferred Lender, CWB has been delegated the loan approval, closing and most servicing and liquidation responsibility from the SBA.
 
Under the CARES Act, CWB offered SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.  The loans are forgivable in whole or in part and carry a fixed rate of 1% for a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.  Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of the forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is ten months after the day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within the ten-month period.
 
Loans to One Borrower
 
Under federal law, the unsecured obligations of any one borrower to a national bank generally may not exceed 15% of the sum of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, and the secured and unsecured obligations of any one borrower. CWB was approved to increase this lending limit under the OCC’s Special Lending Limits Program to 25%. This program ensures that national bank lending limits, such as CWB’s, would remain competitive with state-chartered banks. In addition, California state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a state-chartered bank may lend to a single borrower to 15% of the bank's capital for unsecured loans and 25% of the bank's capital for secured loans, and considers real estate secured loans as “secured” for lending limits purposes.
Foreign Operations
 
The Company has no foreign operations.  The Bank may provide loans, letters of credit and other trade-related services to commercial enterprises that conduct business outside the United States.
Customer Concentration
 
The Company does not have any customer relationships that individually account for 10% of consolidated or segment revenues, respectively.
 
COMPETITION
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive.  Many of the Bank's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have higher lending limits, and can offer a broader range of financial services than the Bank can offer and may have lower cost structures.
 
This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long-term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier; changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools; the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers; and the flight of deposit customers to perceived increased safety. We compete for customers related to loans and deposits, and customers with other banks, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, and other non-bank financial services providers.  This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the rates of those products and the terms on which they are offered to clients.
 
Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets.
 
Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses and increase revenues to remain competitive.  The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company.
