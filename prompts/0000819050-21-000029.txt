ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative and differentiated prescription therapeutics for debilitating skin diseases with a focus on our lead asset for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Our executive management team and board of directors bring extensive experience in product development and global commercialization, having served in leadership roles at large global pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that have developed and/or launched successful products, including several that were first-in-class and/or achieved iconic status, such as Cialis®, Taltz®, Gemzar®, Prozac®, Cymbalta®, and Juvederm®.
Our pivotal Phase 3 clinical-stage investigational product candidate, sofpironium bromide, is a new chemical entity that belongs to a class of medications called anticholinergics. Anticholinergics block the action of acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits signals within the nervous system that are responsible for a range of bodily functions, including activation of the sweat glands. Sofpironium bromide was retrometabolically designed. Retrometabolic drugs are designed to exert their action locally and are potentially rapidly metabolized to a less active form once absorbed into the blood. This proposed mechanism of action may allow for potentially highly effective doses to be used while limiting systemic side effects. We intend to develop sofpironium bromide as a potential best-in-class, self-administered, once daily, topical therapy for the treatment of primary axillary (underarm) hyperhidrosis. 
Hyperhidrosis is a life-altering condition of sweating beyond what is physiologically necessary for thermoregulation of the body. It is believed to be caused by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands and affects an estimated 15.3 million, or 4.8%, of the U.S. population. According to a 2016 update on the prevalence and severity of hyperhidrosis in the U.S. by Doolittle et al., axillary hyperhidrosis, which is the targeted first potential indication for sofpironium bromide, is the most common occurrence of hyperhidrosis, affecting approximately 65% of patients, or an estimated 10 million individuals, in the U.S.
We are currently developing sofpironium bromide in the U.S. for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated the pivotal Phase 3 program for sofpironium bromide, which is comprised of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (Cardigan I and II) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel, 15% compared to vehicle (placebo) in approximately 350 subjects (per trial) aged nine years or older with primary axillary hyperhidrosis in the U.S. We expect to report topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 program in the fourth quarter of 2021. If successful, the results from these studies are expected to form the basis of a prospective NDA in the U.S. with the FDA for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.
Collaboration with Kaken in Asia
We and our development partner in Asia, Kaken, have conducted multiple clinical trials of sofpironium bromide gel that encompass over 1,300 subjects in the U.S. and Japan. These trials evaluated the potential safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“PK”), and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel in adult and pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis and healthy adult subjects. Under our License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Kaken, dated March 31, 2015 (as amended, the “Kaken Agreement”), in exchange for paying us an upfront, non-refundable payment, we granted Kaken the exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize sofpironium bromide in Japan and certain other Asian countries. 
In September 2020, Kaken received regulatory approval in Japan to manufacture and market sofpironium bromide gel, 5% (brand name: ECCLOCK®) for the once-daily treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Japan is the first country to approve sofpironium bromide, which also marks the first approval of a topical prescription product for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in Japan. This approval was based on the results of Kaken’s Japanese pivotal Phase 3 registration study of sofpironium bromide gel, 5% in 281 patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, in which all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated statistically significant differences between sofpironium bromide gel and vehicle. In addition, sofpironium bromide gel, 5% was observed to be safe and generally well tolerated in this study, as well as in the accompanying 52-week long-term safety extension study with 185 patients in Japan.
After receiving regulatory approval in 2020 for ECCLOCK® from Japanese regulators, Kaken applied for and received pricing approval in Japan, which is required by law to do so before selling. In November 2020, ECCLOCK® was placed on Japan’s National Health Insurance (“NHI”) drug reimbursement price list. The NHI listed drug price for ECCLOCK® in Japan is ¥243.70 per gram, which is ¥4,874.00 (USD $46.47) for a 20-gram bottle or approximately a two-week supply.
In November 2020, Kaken launched commercial sales of ECCLOCK® in Japan. Under the Kaken Agreement, we are entitled to receive commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties based on a percentage of net sales of sofpironium bromide gel in Japan. Furthermore, Kaken has rights to develop and commercialize sofpironium bromide in South Korea, China, and certain other Asian countries, and we are entitled to receive royalties based on a percentage of Kaken’s net sales in these countries. At this time, Kaken is focused only on commercialization of the sofpironium bromide gel in Japan. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began recognizing royalty revenue earned on a percentage of net sales of sofpironium bromide in Japan.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, develop, and commercialize innovative and differentiated pharmaceutical products that we believe can be successful in the marketplace and transform lives by solving currently unmet patient needs. The key components of our patient-focused strategy are to: 
Advance our lead late-stage product candidate, sofpironium bromide, through pivotal U.S. Phase 3 clinical trials and engage appropriately with patients and members of the dermatology community. We believe that our management team’s expertise in designing and executing product development programs in dermatology and other therapeutic areas, will enable us to advance sofpironium bromide through pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. If approved, we intend to promote awareness of sofpironium bromide and hyperhidrosis among key opinion leaders, including prescribing dermatologists and pediatricians, patient advocacy groups like the International Hyperhidrosis Society, and directly to patients and their families coping with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Consumer activation through a variety of media, including social media, will be essential to educate both patients and physicians appropriately regarding hyperhidrosis and the potential benefits associated with a safe, effective, and differentiated treatment option for this debilitating condition. 
Evaluate our existing early-stage product candidates, in-license or acquire new product candidates and, potentially, commercial-stage products, while maintaining a strong relationship with our current strategic partner. We intend to continue to evaluate our existing pipeline of product candidates and will also explore other potential external product opportunities. We intend to continue to identify, evaluate, in-license and acquire attractive product candidates at the appropriate level of investment from a variety of strategic sources. We entered into an out-license transaction with Kaken for the development and commercialization of sofpironium bromide in Japan and certain other Asian countries. We expect to continue to engage with Kaken and further develop our strong global partnership to create value for sofpironium bromide in the U.S., Japan, and other countries. 
Expand our team of enthusiastic, committed, and experienced professionals. We intend to expand our team by selectively identifying and hiring experienced, talented, dedicated, and diverse employees who align with our culture, values, and patient-centric mission and can make significant contributions to our company, consistent with our current (and any future) financing.
Hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis is a debilitating, life-altering skin disorder of chronic excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically necessary for thermoregulation of the body. Current estimates show that primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating without an alternative origin) affects approximately 4.8% of the U.S. population, or over 15 million people, and about 8.8% and 17.1% of the U.S. population ages 18 to 39 and 12 to 17, respectively. Of hyperhidrosis sufferers, 70% report severe excessive sweating that they cannot control or shut off in at least one body area. The most common area where excessive sweating occurs is the underarms (axilla; 51%), followed by the face (42%), palms of the hands (40%), and the soles of the feet (38%). It is estimated that nearly half (49%) of people with hyperhidrosis have not discussed their condition with a healthcare professional, either because they do not yet know it is a medical condition or believe that no adequate treatment options exist. Furthermore, in one survey, 75% of subjects with hyperhidrosis said that it has had negative impacts on their professional and social lives, sense of well-being, and emotional and mental health. We believe that, due to the lack of diagnosis, available treatment options, and knowledge about the disease, hyperhidrosis presents a substantial market opportunity for a new, innovative, effective, and well-tolerated topical treatment. We believe that such a therapy could not 
only penetrate the segment of patients who currently seek treatment from a physician, but also encourage more patients to come forward and seek treatment for this condition that causes them to deal with (and try to hide) it each and every day. 
Current Hyperhidrosis Treatment Options and Limitations 
The market for products to control sweating is large yet highly underpenetrated by innovative prescription pharmaceutical products thoroughly tested in clinical trials. More specifically, current hyperhidrosis treatment options generally fall into one of the following categories:
•Self-administered topicals, which include topical antiperspirants, some of which are prescription only, containing metal salts like aluminum that block the release of sweat to the skin surface by clogging the opening of the duct and Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium) cloth, approved in June 2018 by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. For decades, topical antiperspirants containing metal salts have been the most widely used treatment option for hyperhidrosis. Over-the-counter (“OTC”) antiperspirants contain low concentrations of metal salts and are generally well-tolerated but limited in efficacy. Prescription antiperspirants containing higher concentrations of metal salts are typically recommended as the treatment of choice when OTC antiperspirants prove ineffective. However, these are only marginally more effective, and their tolerability is limited by skin irritation associated with increased metal salt concentrations, which react with water to form irritating hydrochloric acid on the skin. Qbrexza is available by prescription and is administered once nightly by the patient using a single-use cloth pre-moistened with the active ingredient, 2.4% glycopyrronium solution, packaged in individual pouches. Qbrexza inhibits the action of acetylcholine on sweat glands, thereby reducing sweating. While Qbrexza is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, we believe that there is room to expand the market in general with disease and treatment education and for additional products with improved efficacy and/or tolerability profiles.
•Injectable, systemic, and other treatments that block activation of the sweat glands. Therapeutic options for patients who are not satisfied with topical therapies are largely limited to more cumbersome or invasive treatment strategies directed either to blocking the activation of, destroying, or removing altogether the sweat glands. Intradermal injections of botulinum toxin type A, or BOTOX®, a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine, are effective but can be painful, costly, and must be administered by a physician with patients receiving on average 20 to 40 injections to each axilla every six to nine months. A microwave device, MiraDry®, is designed to overheat and destroy sweat glands as a different option. However, treatment with MiraDry may be painful, require multiple physician visits, cause permanent destruction of the sweat glands, and is not generally covered by insurance. All these treatments are time-consuming and require a significant investment of physician training and administration time and, in the case of microwave treatment, capital investment by the treating physician. As a result, these treatments have limited attractiveness both to doctors and their patients. Furthermore, they are also not approved or well-suited for application to other affected body areas, including the hands or feet. Iontophoresis, which involves soaking the hands or feet in water through which an electrical current is passed, can be performed in a physician’s office or at home, but requires repeated, time-consuming, and often bothersome treatments. 
•Surgical and other procedures intended to destroy or remove sweat glands. Some patients with severe hyperhidrosis may choose to be treated with invasive surgical techniques that involve removal of sweat glands or destruction of nerves that transmit activating signals to the glands. Surgery is a significant and costly permanent undertaking that can be associated with numerous severe side effects, including increased compensatory sweat production in other body areas. 
Deciding among these available treatments depends on many factors including price, ease of administration, the applicable treatment’s safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, the affected area, severity of the disease and impact on the patient’s quality of life due to the disease being uncontrolled. As a result of the limitations of the currently available treatment options, we believe that there is a significant unmet patient need for a new, effective, safe, well-tolerated, self-administered, prescription topical hyperhidrosis therapy. 
Sofpironium Bromide for Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis
Sofpironium bromide, our lead investigational product candidate, is a new chemical entity that belongs to a class of medications called anticholinergics. We intend to develop sofpironium bromide as a potential best-in-class, self-administered, once daily, topical therapy for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age 
and older. Sofpironium bromide was designed as a structural analog of a well-known potent anticholinergic, glycopyrrolate, to achieve its therapeutic effect at the application site (skin) similar to glycopyrrolate. However, it differs from glycopyrrolate in that sofpironium bromide was retrometabolically designed. Retrometabolic drugs are intended to exert their action locally and are potentially rapidly metabolized to a less active form once absorbed into the blood. This retrometabolic approach to drug design is intended to allow for potentially highly effective doses to be used while limiting systemic side effects.
Key design attributes of a retrometabolic drug include:
•The synthesis of a retrometabolic drug is achieved by starting with a known inactive metabolite of a known active drug (e.g., glycopyrrolate).
•The inactive, or less active, metabolite is then structurally modified to an active form (an analogue of active drug in this case, glycopyrrolate) that will undergo a predictable one-step transformation back into the inactive metabolite in vivo after exerting its therapeutic effect.
•Thus, the retrometabolic drug concept is based upon predictable metabolic deactivation processes by both hydrolysis and further enzymatic (e.g., CYP450) metabolism, predominantly following systemic absorption.
Sofpironium bromide is delivered as a gel formulation in a metered-dose pump with an applicator that allows patients to avoid unwanted direct product contact to the hands or other non-axillary body parts. We believe that this will help avoid certain side effects that could be caused by the unintended transference of the drug, such as to the eyes.
Clinical Development of Sofpironium Bromide
We, and our development partner Kaken, have conducted multiple clinical trials of sofpironium bromide gel that encompass over 1,300 subjects in the U.S. and Japan. These trials evaluated the potential safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel in adult and pediatric patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis and healthy adult subjects.
In clinical studies conducted to date, all three concentrations of sofpironium bromide gel tested (5%, 10%, and 15%) were safe and generally well tolerated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. There has been one death unrelated to sofpironium bromide, and no serious adverse reactions have been reported in any clinical studies with sofpironium bromide gel. Thirteen serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported, and all were determined to be unrelated to sofpironium bromide gel administration. Consistent with a retrometabolic drug design, a low incidence of systemic TEAEs has been found in all clinical studies of sofpironium bromide gel with a trend toward dose-dependency observed. The most common TEAEs were dry mouth and blurred vision. Of note, the TEAEs were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and transient in duration (i.e., resolving gradually with continued use). Local application site tolerability reactions of burning, itching, pain, erythema, and dryness at the axillae were predominantly minimal in severity and typically transient.
Overall, all three sofpironium bromide gel concentrations, 5%, 10%, and 15%, exhibited a larger absolute mean reduction in gravimetric sweat production (“GSP”) from baseline to end of treatment (“EOT”) compared with vehicle, with the reduction at the 15% concentration being statistically significant. However, while there was a slight trend toward dose response, all gel concentrations were essentially similar in patient-reported outcome (“PRO”) measures based on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary (“HDSM-Ax”), modified Dermatology Life Quality Index (“DLQI”), and Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (“HDSS”). All three sofpironium bromide gel concentrations, 5%, 10%, and 15%, were statistically significant on the HDSM-Ax PRO assessment. Also, the HDSM-Ax responses were seen as early as Day 8 and remained consistent throughout the applicable treatment period.
U.S. Phase 2b Clinical Trial (BBI-4000-CL-203)
The U.S. Phase 2b clinical trial was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied sofpironium bromide gel, 5%, 10%, and 15%, in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The trial enrolled a total of 227 patients across 23 clinical sites in the U.S., with patients randomized to either sofpironium bromide gel, 5% (n=57), 10% (n=57), 15% (n=56), or vehicle gel (placebo; n=57) who applied the assigned product to the axillae (underarms) once daily, at bedtime, for 42 days. The objectives of this trial were to evaluate (1) the effect of sofpironium bromide gel, 5%, 10%, and 15% on hyperhidrosis disease severity as it relates to HDSM-Ax, GSP, HDSS, and modified DLQI; and (2) the safety and local tolerability of sofpironium bromide gel, 5%, 10%, and 15%.
Changes in HDSM-Ax measures indicated statistically significant differences from placebo in all sofpironium gel dose groups with all methods of analysis. Statistically significant differences in favor of active treatment groups were observed as early as Day 8 and were sustained over time. A significant higher proportion of active treatment subjects had at least a 2-point change from baseline to EOT in HDSM-Ax-11 items scale (5% gel: 47.4%, p=0.007; 10% gel: 49.1%, p=0.006; 15% gel: 50.0%, p=0.002; vehicle: 22.8%). Larger absolute mean reductions in GSP from baseline to EOT were found for all sofpironium bromide gel concentrations compared to vehicle gel, with the results with sofpironium bromide gel, 15% being statistically significant. Treatment with sofpironium bromide gel, 15% (U.S. pivotal Phase 3 active dose group) resulted in statistically significant reduction in GSP from baseline to EOT (-217 mg, p=0.06; vehicle: -143 mg). The 5% and 10% dose groups resulted in -163 mg (p=0.32) and -174 mg (p=0.26) reduction in GSP from baseline to EOT, respectively. Consistently, superior ranked values indicating GSP reduction from baseline to EOT were observed for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% in comparison to vehicle. The ranked order analysis did not indicate a baseline to EOT reduction in GSP for the vehicle group; a p-value of 0.04 comparing sofpironium bromide, 15% gel to vehicle indicated the sofpironium bromide, 15% improvement to be real and not observed by chance. All sofpironium bromide gel groups met the secondary efficacy endpoints for HDSS and modified DLQI. It was prespecified in the study protocol and statistical analysis plan that as a Phase 2 study, a 1-sided p<0.10 in favor of an active treatment would be regarded as statistically significant. All p-values cited in this study were 1-sided per the protocol and statistical analysis plan.
Among the safety population (includes all subjects who received study drug at least once; n=225), the subject incidence of TEAEs was higher in the sofpironium bromide gel 15% group (51.9%) compared to the other groups (5% gel: 29.8%; 10% gel: 33.6%; vehicle gel: 15.8%). The majority of the systemic TEAEs were consistent with adverse events due to anticholinergic activity. The most common TEAEs included dry mouth (5% gel: 15.8%; 10% gel: 17.5%; 15% gel: 22.2% and vehicle gel: 1.8%) and blurred vision (5% gel: 3.5.%; 10% gel: 10.5%; 15% gel: 9.3% and vehicle gel: 0.0%). The majority of TEAEs in each group were mild or moderate in severity. Severe TEAEs were reported by 4 subjects in the 15% group and 2 subjects each in the 10% and 5% groups. The vast majority of severe TEAEs were anticholinergic TEAEs (dry mouth and vision blurred) or application site TEAEs (application site pain, application site pruritus, application site erythema, application site dryness, and application site exfoliation). There was one case of severe osteomyelitis that was an SAE assessed as not related to sofpironium bromide gel. Treatment in all dose groups was well-tolerated. Local tolerability assessments indicated that all three active treatment groups; 15%, 10%, and 5% were well tolerated over the 42-day treatment period. Each local tolerability symptom/sign (burning, itching, dryness, scaling, and erythema) was absent in the majority of subjects in each group at each study visit. The incidence of these symptoms/signs was generally higher in the sofpironium bromide gel groups compared to the vehicle group. The majority of tolerability symptoms/signs were minimal to mild in severity and most resolved by the Day 57 visit. Severe tolerability symptoms/signs (burning, itching, and erythema) were reported only in the sofpironium bromide gel groups.
Our U.S. Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials
Based on the positive results observed in clinical trials for sofpironium bromide conducted globally to date by us and Kaken, we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2020 two U.S. pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (also referred to as our “Phase 3 Program” or “Cardigan Studies”) that are both currently enrolling patients.
In October 2020, we initiated our first of two pivotal U.S. Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating sofpironium bromide gel, 15% for the treatment for primary axillary (underarm) hyperhidrosis (the “Cardigan I Study”). The Cardigan I Study is expected to enroll up to 350 subjects aged nine years and older with primary axillary hyperhidrosis and is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle (placebo)-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. Subjects will apply sofpironium bromide or vehicle once daily at bedtime to their underarms for six consecutive weeks, with a two-week post-treatment follow-up. The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Cardigan I Study include the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-point improvement on the HDSM-Ax scale, a proprietary and validated PRO measure, and change in GSP, each from baseline to EOT. In addition, safety and tolerability assessments will be performed throughout the study. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, we have exceeded 50% enrollment in the Cardigan I study.
In December 2020, we initiated the second of the two pivotal U.S. Phase 3 clinical trials for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% for the primary axillary (underarm) hyperhidrosis (the “Cardigan II Study”). The Cardigan II Study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel, 15% versus vehicle in approximately 350 subjects aged nine years and older with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, all investigational sites are activated, and enrollment of subjects has begun.
We expect to complete enrollment of the Cardigan Studies in the third quarter of 2021 and anticipate announcing topline results from the Cardigan Studies in the fourth quarter of 2021. If successful, the results from the Cardigan Studies are expected to form the basis of a prospective NDA in the U.S. for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.
U.S. Phase 3 Open-Label Long-Term Safety Study
In July 2020, we completed our 12-month Phase 3, open-label, long-term safety study evaluating sofpironium gel, 5% and 15% in 300 subjects aged nine years and older with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The study results confirmed to us that sofpironium bromide gel, at both concentrations, was safe and generally well tolerated, which was consistent with the earlier Phase 2 clinical trial results. No treatment-related SAEs were observed.
Japan Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial
The Japan Phase 3 pivotal study was a randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of topically applied sofpironium bromide gel, 5% in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The Phase 3 pivotal study evaluated a total of 281 Japanese subjects at 22 sites. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to apply sofpironium bromide gel, 5% or vehicle gel (placebo) once daily to the axillae for 42 days. All subjects had HDSS scores ≥ 3, HDSM-Ax scores ≥ 2 and ≥ 50 mg/5 min GSP in each axilla at baseline. All primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints were met and demonstrated statistically significant differences between sofpironium bromide gel and placebo. In addition, sofpironium bromide gel was deemed to be safe and generally well tolerated in this study.
Other Pipeline Programs
While we are primarily focused on the development of sofpironium bromide gel for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, we will continue to evaluate the development of our current earlier stage pipeline, as well as the potential to in-license and/or acquire other potential drug candidates.
AnGes Collaboration Agreement
In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with AnGes, Inc. (“AnGes”) relating to the development and potential commercialization of AnGes’ proprietary investigational adjuvanted plasmid DNA vaccine intended to prevent COVID-19. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, AnGes will continue to lead the development of its vaccine candidate in Japan, and we will provide information and know-how that could be relevant to such development efforts. If AnGes obtains positive results from its clinical studies in Japan and we are able to satisfy certain conditions, including raising the required development funding, we would have the right to lead the development efforts in the U.S. and certain emerging markets. If ultimately approved for sale in the applicable jurisdictions, AnGes would have commercial rights to the vaccine in Japan and we would have commercial rights in the U.S. and certain emerging markets on terms and conditions to be agreed with AnGes prior to any launch of a vaccine product. AnGes completed a Phase 1/2 study and is currently conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical study with its vaccine candidate in Japan. If the development process continues based on this effort, a larger Phase 3 registration study will be required for any regulatory approval.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our team’s extensive pharmaceutical development and commercialization experience launching successful drugs across multiple therapeutic areas, scientific knowledge, and global industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Eli Lilly and Company, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, OTC companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and research institutions. 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated amongst a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than our current or future product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a patented portfolio of product 
candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products and which will transform the lives of patients suffering from debilitating, chronic skin disorders that do not go away, even with conventional treatment options. 
Competition in Hyperhidrosis 
If approved for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, we anticipate that sofpironium bromide would compete with other therapies used for hyperhidrosis, including: 
•Self-Administered Treatments. Self-administered treatments, such as OTC and prescription topical antiperspirants, and Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium) 2.4% cloth. Oral and compounded topical anticholinergics could be used off-label by administering physicians. 
•Non-Surgical Office-Based Procedures. Office-based procedures have been approved for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, including intradermal injections of BOTOX®, marketed by AbbVie Inc., and MiraDry®, a microwave-based treatment marketed by Miramar Labs, Inc. 
•Surgical Treatments. Surgical treatments include techniques for the removal of sweat glands, such as excision, curettage, and liposuction. Surgical procedures, such as endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, are also used to destroy nerves that transmit activating signals to sweat glands. 
In addition to approved and off-label hyperhidrosis treatments, there are also several treatments currently under development that could potentially be used to treat hyperhidrosis and may compete directly with sofpironium bromide.
Intellectual Property and In-Licensing Agreements
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure proprietary protection for our products and technologies, including those in development, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such threats, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. 
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
We also intend to use regulatory exclusivity (also called data package exclusivity), or depending on eligibility, orphan drug designation, as a means of acquiring intellectual property protections that are separate and distinct to patents for some of our pipeline candidates. These kinds of rights involve being given exclusivity for varying periods of time depending on the country to incentivize innovators who invest significant funds in and conduct clinical trials to produce necessary data to demonstrate a drug is safe and effective for its intended use(s) and, as such, the data package in an NDA for the FDA (or similar regulatory filings in other countries) should receive protection even if no patent is available, or exclusivity given to produce a treatment for a disease that otherwise would not realistically be invested in without such incentive. In addition, there are other forms of intellectual property protection we may seek worldwide, including but not limited to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, pediatric exclusivity and the like, where available and appropriate for our business interests.
We further protect our proprietary information by requiring our directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to our Company without adequate permission to do so. In addition, we require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials. 
As of December 31, 2020, regarding our complete patent portfolio, we own or possess an exclusive license to 24 issued U.S. patents and 100 issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various European Union member states. We also own or possess an exclusive license to 13 pending U.S. patent applications and 86 pending international and foreign patent applications. With regard to our lead product candidate, sofpironium bromide, we own or possess an exclusive license to nine issued U.S. and 85 issued foreign patents as well as 12 pending U.S. and 82 pending foreign patent applications which, if issued, may provide patent term coverage until 2040 in certain cases and countries.
Together with Kaken, we were granted by the Japanese Patent Office a composition of matter patent with claims directed to the novel polymorphic, or crystalline, forms of sofpironium bromide that are being commercialized by Kaken in Japan and would be by us in the U.S. subject to our own ongoing development efforts, and this patent is expected to provide additional protection for these newly developed and distinct forms in certain countries, including Japan, potentially through 2040.
We aim to take advantage of a broad range of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary exclusive positions for our product candidates, where available. 
Amended and Restated License Agreement with Bodor
In February 2020, we, together with Brickell Subsidiary and Bodor Laboratories, Inc. and Dr. Nicholas S. Bodor (collectively, “Bodor”) entered into an amended and restated license agreement (the “Amended and Restated License Agreement”). The Amended and Restated License Agreement supersedes the License Agreement, dated December 15, 2012, entered into between Brickell Subsidiary and Bodor, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to License Agreement, effective as of October 21, 2013, and Amendment No. 2 to License Agreement, effective as of March 31, 2015.
The Amended and Restated License Agreement retains with us a worldwide, exclusive license to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and sublicense products containing the proprietary compound sofpironium bromide based upon the patents referenced in the Amended and Restated License Agreement for a defined field of use. In exchange for entering into the Amended and Restated License Agreement, settling the previously disclosed dispute, and resolving the associated litigation between us and Bodor, we made an upfront payment of $1.0 million in cash to Bodor following the execution of the Amended and Restated License Agreement and the settlement agreement by and among the Company, Brickell Subsidiary, and Bodor, dated February 17, 2020. Additionally, under the original License Agreement and the Amended and Restated License Agreement, we are required to pay Bodor (i) a royalty on sales of product outside Kaken’s territory, including a low single-digit royalty on sales of certain product not covered by the patent estate licensed from Bodor; (ii) a specified percentage of all royalties we receive from Kaken for sales of product within its territory; (iii) a percentage of non-royalty sublicensing income we receive from Kaken or other sublicensees; and (iv) up to an aggregate of $1.8 million (plus an additional $0.1 million for approvals of additional products) in cash payments and $1.5 million of shares of our common stock upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and other milestones including the enrollment of the first patient in the U.S. Phase 3 trials. Based on the foregoing, we made a $0.5 million milestone payment to Bodor in June 2020 following the closing of our public offering in June 2020. Additionally, in October 2020, in association with the enrollment of the first patient in our U.S. Phase 3 pivotal program, we made a cash payment of $0.5 million and issued $0.5 million, or 480,769 shares, of our common stock to Bodor. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an aggregate of $1.5 million as research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Further, following December 31, 2020, we have begun to pay Bodor the required royalties based on the royalty revenue we have recognized from Kaken’s net sales of sofpironium bromide in Japan.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of drug substances and drug products for use in nonclinical and clinical studies, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. To our knowledge, all of our clinical drug substance and drug product manufacturing activities are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”). We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over the contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) with which we contract. We rely on third-party cGMP manufacturers for scale-up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of development product candidates for use in nonclinical and clinical studies.
Government Regulation
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the U.S., prescription human drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial 
suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, corporate integrity agreements, and criminal prosecution. 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Exemption (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In addition, other tests on the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) of producing the drug and its various formulations to establish the shelf life, storage conditions, and quality parameters and specification must be conducted and submitted. 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including current good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulation. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product CMC described above and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND is considered in effect, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy subjects or patients under the supervision of a qualified physician investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (1) in compliance with federal and state regulations; (2) in compliance with current good clinical practice (“cGCP”) regulations, an international standard (as adopted by FDA) meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated as well as the actual primary and secondary endpoints of the study to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial participants. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to a local or central institutional review board (“IRB”) (outside the U.S., these are called Ethics Committees) for approval and oversight. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or in rarer cases early phases may be skipped depending on the amount and quality of data that exists. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects associated with administration of the investigational drug and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled prospective Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug by comparing a treatment arm against a control (placebo or best supportive care) arm. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances for FDA registration where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically impossible or ethically problematic. 
Currently, our lead asset, sofpironium bromide, is being investigated in the U.S. for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Patients are being enrolled in two Phase 3 registration trials at the time of the filing of this Annual Report, called the Cardigan I and II studies. A long-term safety study on sofpironium bromide has already completed, along with Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and are expected to be part of an NDA submission to FDA at the appropriate time. 
After completion of required clinical testing, applicable law requires that an NDA be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S., which will be the case for sofpironium bromide. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology and CMC. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. In the case of sofpironium bromide, payment of a user fee is not expected to be required for filing of an initial NDA, because FDA guidance waives, or reduces, user fees for, among other things, a small business applicant, like us, submitting its first NDA. 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed with Congress to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Priority review can be applied to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. In addition, FDA provides an accelerated approval mechanism applied to investigational drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. It is not expected that sofpironium bromide will be eligible for priority review, or accelerated approval, based on the present criteria. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts in the targeted disease, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. It is not known at this time whether FDA will require an advisory committee for review of any NDA that may be submitted for sofpironium bromide, and that decision will be made by FDA during the NDA review.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more of the sponsor’s clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCPs. Additionally, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data sufficient to support the labeled shelf life and to demonstrate that the drug can be manufactured reliably in a controlled manner.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information required. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the U.S. with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval letter may contain safety information that limits the ability of the drug to be marketed (e.g., black box warning; although these are not expected for sofpironium bromide) or contains contraindications, warnings, and/or precautions that limit the potential of the drug’s desirability (these are standard for most approved drugs). As another potential condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) for drugs that are effective but also have potentially significant safety concerns. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing and/or manufacturing. 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates, in part, the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, social media, off-label promotion, formulary and reimbursement presentations, product sampling, sales force activities including dissemination of peer-reviewed journal articles and detailing practices with prescribers, health care practitioner interactions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, other promotional activities involving the internet and to other press, publicity and media communications initiated by us, while other parts of the government regulate against false claims, foreign corrupt practices, trade sanctions, and anti-kickbacks. States often impose strict legal requirements and prohibitions on a variety of post-approval drug marketing practices. We may market drugs holding an approved NDA only for the permitted indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
Adverse event reporting, pharmacovigilance, and submission of periodic reports are required of the NDA holder following FDA approval of that NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, the aforementioned REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product especially in the U.S. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or risk being sanctioned by FDA from supplying the drugs they manufacture. Regulatory authorities also may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing and supply, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the “Orange Book.” Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical studies to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug and may be required to be switched to from the original innovator drug by certain laws or insurance and formulary practices, which can affect the profitability of the drug adversely. 
To proceed forward, the ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant also may elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, 
the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then commence a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product expires.
It is not known at this time whether and to what extent, or when, an ANDA applicant may emerge with respect to sofpironium bromide, or any other pipeline product in our portfolio. 
Regulatory Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active molecule that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. 
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension in the U.S. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase, the time between IND application and NDA submission, and all of the review phase, the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. Only one extension may be granted per product per patent. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. As stated, we expect to file an NDA for sofpironium bromide if the Cardigan I and II studies are successful.
It is premature to know what, and if any, patent term extension that may be allowed would be at this time.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration in each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. We are studying pediatric populations aged nine and older in various of our clinical trials for sofpironium bromide, including the Cardigan I and II pivotal trials. We have a Pediatric Study Plan for sofpironium bromide agreed to with FDA.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non-patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and report on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, including when a clinical trial is initiated (often on www.clintrials.gov); you can access this information for certain Company studies including several involving sofpironium bromide at this website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase, type and scope of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration process. Sponsors are obligated also to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion and industry trade association ethics guidelines require publication of both favorable and unfavorable study results, which can affect the potential market for a drug. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
Regulation Outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates, as well as extent, scope, and enforceability of intellectual property rights associated with the product candidate. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product like sofpironium bromide, we, or our local partners, must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before it can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process similar to the FDA’s that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In some cases, once the investigational drug is approved by a regulatory agency in certain established markets, like the FDA in the U.S., other countries will allow a sponsor to rely on that other country’s approval and extend it, with the same terms and conditions, in the foreign country and this may accelerate the introduction of the drug in foreign markets, where applicable (often called a free sales certificate (“FSC”), or also a CPP, process). 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
As discussed herein, our lead investigational product sofpironium bromide has received marketing authorization from Japan’s regulators issued to our local partner in Japan, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. under Kaken’s trade name ECCLOCK®. At the time of this disclosure, there are no other clinical trials or submissions pending in any other country outside the U.S. for sofpironium bromide or any other Company pipeline product.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws in the U.S. have been applied to restrict or prohibit certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, and anticorruption. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (“PPACA”), amended the intent element of the federal anti-kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical 
manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may violate federal false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under certain federal false claims laws. 
The majority of U.S. states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud and false statements statutes, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. 
Violations of these federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws are punishable in the U.S. by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
Under the Open Payments Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to annually collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to certain health care professionals, including physicians, and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Other countries require similar reporting, including France and Belgium, if the product is approved and marketed there. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners and entities in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still, other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil or other penalties. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, by us or any potential commercial partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce a physician’s willingness to prescribe our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed, such as was the case with our partner Kaken in Japan for ECCLOCK®, which received pricing approval earlier this year as described elsewhere in this disclosure statement. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in Japan and the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower, even lower than pricing that might be obtainable in some emerging market countries. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 13 regular full-time employees. From time to time, we retain independent contractors. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be excellent. 
Corporate History
Vical Incorporated (“Vical”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1987. On August 31, 2019, the Delaware corporation formerly known as “Vical Incorporated” completed a reverse merger transaction in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated June 2, 2019, as further amended on August 20, 2019 and August 30, 2019, by and among Vical, Brickell Biotech, Inc.
