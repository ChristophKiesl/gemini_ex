Item 1.         Business
General
 
Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. (“Tel”, “TIC” or the “Company”) has been in business since 1947 and is a leading designer and manufacturer of avionics test and measurement solutions for the global commercial air transport, general aviation, and government/military aerospace and defense markets.  The Company designs, manufactures and sells instruments to test and measure, and also calibrates and repairs a wide range of airborne navigation and communication equipment.
 
The Company’s strategy over the years has been to invest heavily in research and development to design products significantly better than its competition. Our products provide the stimulus and signals necessary for certification, verification, fault finding and diagnosis of airborne military and commercial navigation and communication systems. Our products incorporate high levels of integration by combining more test functions into a single unit, and thereby reducing customer acquisition, training, and life-cycle support costs than legacy systems. The Company offers avionic test sets for:
 

■ | Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponders and interrogators. (95% of flight-line test market)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)
--+--------------------------------


■ | Commercial Air Traffic Control
--+-------------------------------


■ | Navigation
--+-----------


■ | Communication
--+--------------

 
Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. an industry leader in developing, producing, selling and supporting field-tested, rugged avionic flight line (ramp) and maintenance (bench) test sets for demanding military and commercial customers that range in list price from $10,000 to $90,000. Founded in 1947 and based in East Rutherford NJ, Tel-Instrument is an OTCQB listed public company trading under ticker symbol TIKK.
 
The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. The Company is successfully extending its dominant market position in Mode 5 test sets in the U.S. defense industry to international partners. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military. Internationally, the Company has been very successful in capturing the lion’s share of the Mode 5 test set business with TIC’s T-47/M5 test set being selected by many international customers including: Canada; the U.K.; Japan; South Korea; and Australia. The Company continues to be in the forefront on Mode 5 research and development and has demonstrated test capability for Mode 5 Level 2B, which provides enhanced secure navigation data to military pilots. The U.S. Army has indicated that they plan to move to this new navigation technology in the next several years. This could entail substantial software upgrade revenues for the thousands of TS-4530A test sets sold to the U.S. Army and U.S.A.F.
 
TIC is also actively working on completing the SDR/OMNI this year with the initial product being a communication and navigation test set for the U.S. military. The communications test capability was moved up in our development schedule based on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial aviation. The U.S. military will need to upgrade thousands of existing communication and navigation test sets over the next several years to address the new frequency and waveform requirements for military radios and we believe the SDR/OMNI is well positioned to capture a large portion of this business.
 
Once the communications and navigation software are completed, TIC plans to introduce software APPS for the commercial transponder testing market. This will provide Transponder (Modes A, C, and S), ADS-B, and 978 MHz UAT capability for the large general aviation test market. This will allow us to compete with the IFR 4000 and 6000 test tests for our military and commercial aviation customers. The SDR-Omni product is a game changer in the commercial and military avionics test market as it will allow customers to replace multiple competitive test sets with one unit that is smaller and provides more capabilities at a fraction of the cost. This new technology could provide us with the opportunity to expand out of our relatively narrow avionics test market niche and enter the much larger secure military and homeland security radio test market which is many times the size of our existing avionics test market. The secure military test set market is very large, and we are anticipating several large competitive DOD solicitations to take place in the next several years.
 
TIC is also working with Lockheed Martin (LMCO) on a new MADL test set. TIC was awarded this contract after winning a competitive solicitation. MADL is a secure communications radio for the F-35. This operates in a much higher frequency range than our other test sets and could represent a further diversification out of our core markets. The contract has been put on hold for at least the next four months due to LMCO funding issues, but we are hopeful that the contract will resume this fall. TIC has completed the majority of the development work on this new test set. If the funding issue is resolved, this could generate substantial recurring revenues for the Company and would position TIC for further development contracts with LMCO.

Company Response to COVID-19
 
Fiscal year 2021 resulted in a sharp reduction in revenues and profitability for the year due mainly to the COVID-19 pandemic which negatively impacted commercial sales and severe supply chain and manufacturing staffing issues which hampered our ability to ship units.
 
The subsequent spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. and many other parts of the world led the World Health Organization to characterize COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Thereafter, most U.S. states imposed “stay-at-home” orders on their populations to stem the spread of COVID-19. Of specific interest to the Company, stay-at-home orders were imposed in the states of New Jersey and Kansas.
 
The State stay-at-home orders generally required the closure of businesses that did not provide essential functions. Because the Company’s operations are as a supplier to the U.S. Military, and its manufacturing operations provide essential functions, the Company was able to continue shipping, receiving and manufacturing activities in the past year. This was extremely challenging due to manufacturing employee absences due to COVID-19 and/or quarantine requirements. The Company advised all other employees that could perform their job functions remotely to do so. As such, the Company’s operations, for the most part, remained operational, albeit at reduced staffing levels.
 
On May 4, 2020, the Company secured a Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) loan, which, among other things is included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in the amount of $772,577. TIC qualified for full loan forgiveness on the initial tranche on December 18, 2020. On January 6, 2021, updated PPP guidance outlining program changes to enhance its effectiveness and accessibility was released on in accordance with the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Non-Profits, and Venues Act. This was available to companies that recorded greater than a 25% sales reduction in any quarter compared to the prior year. The Company qualified for this second round of funding and on March 15, 2021, the company secured a Second Draw PPP loan in the amount of $772,577.
 
Second Draw PPP loans made to eligible borrowers qualify for full loan forgiveness if during the 8- to 24-week covered period following loan disbursement:
 

o | Employee and compensation levels are maintained in the same manner as required for the First Draw PPP loan
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The loan proceeds are spent on payroll costs and other eligible expenses; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | At least 60% of the proceeds are spent on payroll costs
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
A borrower can apply for forgiveness once all loan proceeds for which the borrower is requesting forgiveness have been used. Borrowers can apply for forgiveness any time up to the maturity date of the loan. If borrowers do not apply for forgiveness within 10 months after the last day of the covered period, then PPP loan payments are no longer deferred, and borrowers will begin making loan payments to their PPP lender. The Company plans to file for loan forgiveness of the second tranche of PPP funding during fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
 
The COVID-19 outbreak and the uncertainty of economic conditions relating thereto negatively impacted the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the past fiscal year but the Company expects improved results for FY 2022. Based on the operational and financial plans that management has developed, the Company expects to be able to meet its obligations as they become due over the next twelve months. 
 
Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (“IFF”) Products
 
T-47/M5 Dual Crypto Test Set
 
This new test set has been well-received in the market, especially in the international market.  It is designed as a KIV 77/KIV78 Mode 5 upgrade for the approximately 2,000 AN/APM-480A and T-47 series Mode 4 IFF test sets that the Company has sold both domestically and internationally. This will be a cost-efficient upgrade to Mode 5 for our large installed customer base. The T-47/M5 capabilities allow full testing, simulation and analysis of the following systems: Interrogator/Transponder Test set for Modes 1, 2, 3A, C, S, EHS, ADS-B TX and RX with 4 and Mode 5, TACAN, TCAS I, II and E-TCAS.

TIC believes this will be a key product supporting our future growth and profitability. Tel has also received U.S. DOD AIMS certification for the T-47/M5 Test Set.
 
TS-4530A IFF Test Set
 
The TS-4530A test set provides simple to use GO/NO-GO operation. The TS-4530A, developed under a U.S. Army contract, now tests IFF Mode 5, ADS-B, EHS, and TCAS. The TS-4530A includes a large 8 line, color display and a new 3-button switch assembly that adds a 4-way directional toggle action for improved usability.  The upper housing includes a built-in KIV-77 CCI appliqué enclosure.
 
Based on a new, highly integrated digital architecture; the TS-4530A performs the following tests:
 

● | Transponder: Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, 4 Mode S, EHS (Enhanced Surveillance) and Mode 5 (Levels 1 & 2)

We have delivered over 3,500 TS-4530A kits and test sets. We are seeing continued demand from both the U.S. military and international customers, and we continue to explore all opportunities for this market. 
 
Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (“IFF”) Products (continued)
 
T-4530i IFF Test Set
 
This new test is a software/hardware upgrade of the TS-4530A product. The lead customer for this test is the German military. This unit includes extended life Ni-MH batteries and significantly expanded manual Mode 5 test capability using a seven-year indefinite-delivery-indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract to our European distributor, Muirhead Avionics (“Muirhead”) for T-4530i test sets. In total, TIC has delivered $3.4 million of these test sets to Germany with $1.4 million of these test sets delivered in fiscal year 2021. We expect additional volume orders for this product in fiscal year 2022.
 
Communications/Navigation (“COMM/NAV) Radio Frequency (RF) Avionics Flight line Tester”) (“CRAFT”) (AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719)
 
The AN/USM-708 multi-purpose test set was developed by the Company in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. The AN/USM-708 large 6.0 inch color LCD screen and surrounding soft-keys and keyboard provides easy and quick access to a multiple of test screens menus, and display options affording single man operation, instant results, and a host of pre-programmed and manually variable parameters to meet the most demanding requirements for testing of airborne avionic and communication equipment.

Item 1.          Business (continued)
 
General (continued)
 
The AN/USM-708 has been and continues to be a key product for the Company as it represents a new generation technology product. The Company delivered approximately $40 million in orders, representing over 1,200 test sets, for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 (IFF only) test sets to the U.S. Military. The AN/USM-708 CRAFT unit combines advanced IFF (including Mode 5 encryption technology) navigation, communication, and sonobuoy test capabilities in a portable test set, which will utilize a flexible and expandable digital-signal-processing-based architecture. Both the AN/USM-708 and the AN/USM-719 have been certified by the AIMS Program Office.
 
Based on entirely new up-to-date technology and digital architecture, the AN/USM-708 is a leap forward in precision testing of the following systems:
 

● | Transponder: Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, 4 Mode S, EHS (Enhanced Surveillance) and Mode 5
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interrogator: Modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, 4, Mode S, Mode 5, TCAS & ETCAS, Shipboard Processor
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) TX & RX
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Navigation: VOR, ILS, LOC, GS, MB, TACAN
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Sonobuoy
--+---------


● | Link-4
--+-------


● | VSWR
--+-----

 
This program represented the culmination of a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment by the Company in Mode 5 technology and continues to provide a significant competitive advantage. Management believes that the CRAFT program also has potential for sales into the balance of the U.S. Military, NATO, and internationally, as the new Mode 5 IFF systems are installed in overseas aircraft platforms.
 
The contract for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 was a significant milestone for the Company because the development of this proprietary technology, which was funded by the Company, established Tel’s position as a leader in the industry. The CRAFT test set replaced seven obsolete U.S. Navy test sets that collectively cost approximately $300,000, making the CRAFT test set an excellent value to the government. This unit has been well-received by the end users. The core technology in the AN/USM-708 has been the foundation for additional military and commercial products. 
 
The joint Strike Fighter (“JSF”) program continues to generate CRAFT orders as this program ramps up production. The Company has already received orders from Lockheed Martin for the AN/USM-708 units, for the JSF Program, totaling approximate $8 million. Sikorsky has also indicated that it will be ordering CRAFT test sets for its new helicopters. The Company also believes it will receive orders from other customers for this product.

New Products
 
SDR-OMNI
 
TIC is also actively working on completing the SDR/OMNI this year with the initial product being a communication and navigation test set for the U.S. military. This new test set utilizes true software-designed radio technology that enables it to test all common avionics functions in one 4.5 pound test set, which is half the weight of competitive test sets. The SDR/OMNI has very wide frequency to accommodate new commercial and military waveforms. It utilizes the latest touch screen technology and has the capability to replace all TIC commercial test sets with one handheld product. The communications test capability was moved up in our development schedule based on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial aviation. The U.S. military will need to upgrade thousands of existing communication and navigation test sets over the next several years to address the new frequency and waveform requirements for military radios and we believe the SDR/OMNI is well positioned to capture a large portion of this business.

Once the communications and navigation software are completed, TIC plans to introduce software APPS for the commercial transponder testing market. This will provide Transponder (Modes A, C, and S), ADS-B, and 978 MHz UAT capability for the large general aviation test market. This will allow us to compete with the IFR 4000 and 6000 test tests for our military and commercial aviation customers.

TIC has completed the majority of the development work on this new test set. If the funding issue is resolved, this could generate substantial recurring revenues for the Company and would position TIC for further development contracts with LMCO.
Future Prospects
 
The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military and we have already delivered test sets into 18 international markets. The commercial avionics industry is undergoing a great deal of change,
 
and we believe our new hand-held products that we are planning to introduce this fiscal year, will generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. We are also working closely with our military customers on new potential market opportunities that will be needed to maintain our sales and profitability.
 
The Company manufactures and sells commercial and military products as a single avionics business, and its designs and products cross both markets.
 
Competition
 
The general aviation market consists of some 1,000 avionics repair and maintenance service shops at private and commercial airports in the United States that purchase test equipment to assist in the repair of aircraft electronics. The commercial aviation market consists of approximately 80 domestic and foreign commercial airlines.
 
The civilian market for avionic test equipment is dominated by two designers and manufacturers, the Company and Aeroflex, Inc., a division of Viavi Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV) (“Aeroflex”), with Aeroflex being substantially larger than Tel.  This market is relatively narrow and highly competitive.  Tel has been successful because of its high quality, new technology, user friendly products and competitive prices.  
 
The military market is large and is dominated by large corporations with substantially greater resources than the Company, including Aeroflex.  Tel competitively bids for government contracts based on the engineering quality and innovation of its products, competitive price, and “small business set asides” (i.e., statutory provisions requiring the military to entertain bids only from statutorily defined small businesses), and on bids for sub-contracts from major government suppliers.  There are a limited number of competitors who are qualified to bid for “small business set asides.”  The military market consists of many independent purchasing agencies and offices. The process of awarding contracts is heavily regulated by the U.S. Department of Defense. 
 
Over the last fifteen years, the Company has won several large, competitively bid contracts from the military and has become the primary supplier for the U.S. Military, as well as the NATO countries, of flight line IFF test equipment. The CRAFT AN/USM-708, CRAFT AN/USM-719,TS-4530A, TS-4530i and TR-47/M5 test sets, discussed previously, involve a new generation of technology, including the next generation of IFF testing, and is expected to enable the Company to continue to be a major supplier of avionics test equipment to the military for years to come. Tel believes its new technology will also allow it to increase sales to the commercial avionics market in the future and expand into the very large secure communication test market.

Marketing and Distribution
 
Domestic commercial sales are made throughout the U.S. to commercial airlines and general aviation businesses directly or through distributors. There were two (2) direct commercial customers who accounted for more than 10% of commercial sales in fiscal year 2021 and zero in 2020.  The Company has one domestic distributor which receives discounts ranging between 16%-20% discount for stocking, selling, and, in some cases, providing product calibration and repairs. The loss of this distributor would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operations. U.S. and international Commercial sales represented 15% and 19% of total sales, respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020. Our commercial distributor represented approximately 5% and 20%, respectively, of commercial sales during fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
 
Marketing to the U.S. Government is made directly by employees of the Company or through independent sales representatives, who receive similar commissions to the commercial distributors. For the years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, sales to the U.S. Government, including shipments through the government’s logistics centers, represented approximately 38% and 30%, respectively, of total sales. For the year ended March 31, 2021, two (2) direct customers represented 10% and 33% of total sales and 12% and 39% of government sales, respectively. No international distributor represented 10% of total sales or 10% of government sales for the year ended March 31, 2021.
 
International sales are made throughout the world to government and commercial customers, directly through American export agents, or through the Company’s overseas distributors at a discount reflecting a 15% to 22% selling commission, under written or oral, year-to-year arrangements. The Company has an exclusive distribution agreement with Muirhead Avionics and Accessories, Ltd (“Muirhead”), based in the United Kingdom, to represent the Company in parts of Europe, and with Milspec Services in Australia and New Zealand. Tel also sells its products through exclusive distributors in Spain, Portugal, and the Far East and is exploring distribution in other areas. For the years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, total international sales were 52% and 54%, respectively, of sales, the notable decrease is due partially to the Pandemic. Additionally, the Company has an agreement with M.P.G. Instruments s.r.l., based in Italy, wherein this distributor has the exclusive sales rights for DME/P ramp and bench test units. The Company continues to explore additional marketing opportunities in other parts of the world, including the Far East. One international distributor accounted for 13% of total sales for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020.
 
The Company has no material assets overseas. Tel also provides customers with calibration and repair services. Repairs and calibrations accounted for 10% and 10% of sales for the years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 
Future domestic market growth, if any, will be affected in part by whether the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) implements additional plans to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system regulations and by continuing recent industry trends towards more sophisticated avionics systems, both of which would require the design and manufacture of new test equipment. Currently, the T-47/M5 has been upgrade for continued support of NATO customers and we continue to develop the Mode 5L2B Flight Line Test. This technology will be supported in our T-47/M5 and T-4530i product lines. Military contracts are awarded and implemented by extensive government regulation. The Company believes its test equipment is recognized by its customers for its quality, durability, reliability, affordability, and by its advanced technology.
 
Backlog
 
Set forth below is Tel’s avionics backlog on March 31, 2021, and 2020:
 

 | Commercial | | Government | | | Total
---------------+------------+---------+------------+---+-----------+------
March 31, 2021 | $ | 291,687 | | $ | 7,310,096 | | $ | 7,601,783
March 31, 2020 | $ | 200,193 | | $ | 3,824,984 | | $ | 4,025,177

 
Tel believes that most of its backlog on March 31, 2021, will be delivered during the next 12 months. The backlog is pursuant to purchase orders.  Historically, the Company obtains orders which are required to be filled in less than 12 months, and therefore, backlog amounts at the end of the period do not reflect delivered or future orders.

Suppliers
 
TIC obtains its purchased parts from a number of suppliers.  In fiscal year 2021, our supply chain had significant issues with deliveries being delayed with negatively impacted TIC’s revenues and profitability. The situation appears to be improving this calendar year and the Company is optimistic that it will be able to obtain purchased parts, as needed, at acceptable prices.
Patents and Environmental Laws
 
Tel has no patents or licenses which are material to its business, and there are no material costs incurred to comply with environmental laws.
 
Engineering, Research, and Development
 
In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, Tel incurred expenses of $2,295,901 and $2,239,811, respectively, on the engineering, research, and development of new and improved products.   Engineering, research, and development expenditures in fiscal year 2021 were made primarily for the development of the Company’s SDR/OMNI hand-held product line utilizing CRAFT and TS-4530A technology, the MADL test set for LMCO, and T-4530i, and the incorporation of other product enhancements in existing designs. The Company owns all of these designs with the exception of the AN/ARM-206 product. Tel’s management believes that continued significant expenditures for engineering, research, and development are necessary to enable Tel to expand its products, sales, and profits, and to remain competitive.
Personnel
 
As of June 28, 2021, Tel had 47 employees, comprised of 23 full-time employees in manufacturing, supply chain, and quality assurance, eight in administration and sales, including customer services and product support, and sixteen in engineering, research and development, none of whom belongs to a union. The Company also employs one part-time individual in manufacturing. From time to time, the Company also employs independent contractors to support its manufacturing, engineering, and sales organizations. As of June 28, 2021, the Company utilized three independent contractors in sales management and two Manufacturing temporary employees from an Employment agency. Tel has been successful in attracting skilled and experienced management, sales and engineering personnel, although the market for senior engineering talent is becoming very competitive. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
