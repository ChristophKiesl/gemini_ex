ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
HF Foods Group Inc. acting through its subsidiaries (“HF Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a leading food service distributor to Asian restaurants, primarily Chinese restaurants located in the Southeastern, Pacific and Mountain West regions of the United States. HF Group is the result of a merger between two complementary market leaders, HF Foods Group Inc. and B&R Global Holdings, Inc. ("B&R Global") on November 4, 2019.
We currently have 13 distribution centers strategically located across the east and west coasts of the United States in California, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, and a fleet of over 300 refrigerated vehicles. Capitalizing on our deep understanding of the Chinese culture and with over 780 employees and subcontractors, and supported by two call centers in China, we have become a trusted partner serving approximately 10,000 Asian restaurants in 22 states, providing round-the-clock sales and service support to customers who mainly converse in Mandarin or Chinese dialects. Operating through its subsidiaries, the Company is dedicated to serve the vast array of Asian and Chinese restaurants in need of high-quality and specialized food ingredients at competitive prices.
We are committed to providing excellent customer service by delivering a distinctive product portfolio built from an indelible partnership with both foreign and domestic suppliers. These relationships, coupled with our proprietary centralized inventory procurement system, ensure that we deliver an outstanding array of products at competitive prices. The centralized procurement system provides the Company with great negotiating power with suppliers resulting in competitive prices for our customers. This proprietary system also helps to better manage customer relationships and inventory while providing a solid platform for expansion from acquisition of smaller companies in this fast growing yet fragmented niche market.

Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meaning given to them in the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into B&R Global, resulting in B&R Global becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HF Group. In connection with the closing, HF Group issued 30.7 million of its shares of common stock to the B&R Global Stockholders.

The B&R Global Stockholders will be entitled to “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed following the consummation of the Business Combination, and will have certain demand rights for registration. HF Group will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
•HF Group, B&R Global, and certain of the B&R Global Stockholders entered into a five year Voting Agreement, which provided that, immediately after the closing of the Business Combination, (i) Zhou Min Ni, the former Chief Executive Officer of HF Group, would continue to serve as a director and the chairman of the board of the Company and as Co-CEO; (ii) Xiao Mou Zhang, the pre-Business Combination Chief Executive Officer of B&R Global, would begin serving as a director of HF Group and Co-CEO; (iii) Zhou Min Ni would select one person to serve as an independent director of the Company, (iv) Xiao Mou Zhang would select one person to serve as an independent director, and (v) Zhou Min Ni and Xiao Mou Zhang would jointly select one person to serve as an independent director.

The Company entered into a separation agreement with Zhou Min Ni which amended certain terms of the Voting Agreement mentioned above. In particular, Zhou Min Ni has agreed on behalf of himself and the other parties related to him and which he controls, that the provisions of Sections 2.1(b) (naming Mr. Ni to the Board as the Company Designee), 2.1(d) (allowing Mr. Ni to designate the Company Independent Designee) and 2.1(e) (allowing Mr. Ni to join in the nomination of the Joint Independent Designee) and Section 2.4 (requiring Mr. Ni to be named to the position of Co-Chief Executive Officer) of the Voting Agreement (as it relates only to Mr. Ni and not Xiao Mou Zhang) are no longer applicable or enforceable. On the same date, Xiao Mou Zhang has been promoted to become the sole CEO of Company. The board of directors have also appointment Russell Libby as the new chair of the Company's board of directors. See Note 19 Subsequent Events.
Acquisition of Warehouse Facilities
On January 17, 2020, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by that certain membership interest purchase agreement dated the same date (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among its subsidiary B&R Global, B&R Group Realty, and nine subsidiary limited liability companies wholly owned by B&R Group Realty (the “B&R Realty Subsidiaries”) (the “Acquisition”). Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meaning given to them in the Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, B&R Global acquired all equity membership interests in the B&R Realty Subsidiaries, which own warehouse facilities that were being leased by the Company for its operations in California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Washington, and Montana. Co-CEO of the Company, Peter Zhang, managed and owned an 8.91% interest in B&R Group Realty. The total purchase price for the Acquisition was set at $101,269,706. Financing for the Acquisition was provided under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the terms of which are set forth below, and the lender parties thereto relied upon the appraisals in determining to provide such financing. Based in part on the foregoing, the special transactions review committee, composed of the Company’s independent directors, reviewed and approved the Acquisition and the related financing on behalf of HF Group’s board.
Consideration for the Acquisition was funded by (i) $75.6 million in mortgage-backed term loans financed under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, (ii) issuance by B&R Global of a $7.0 million Unsecured Subordinated Promissory Note (the “Note”) to B&R Group Realty, and (iii) payment of $18.7 million from funds drawn from the Company’s revolving credit facility. The restatement of the mortgage-backed term loans released B&R Group Realty from its obligations to the lenders under the First Amended Credit Agreement and predecessor financing arrangements.
Amendment to Credit Facility
On November 4, 2019, the Company, B&R Global, and certain of the wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company (collectively with the Company, the “Borrowers”), as borrowers, and certain material subsidiaries of the Company as 
Table of Contents

guarantors, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), as Administrative Agent, and certain lender parties thereto. The Amended Credit Agreement provided for (a) a $100 million asset-secured revolving credit facility maturing on November 4, 2022, and (b) mortgage-secured Term Loans of $55.4 million, and amended and restated the existing $75 million secured revolving credit facility and $60 million of real estate term loans evidenced by that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2017, among B&R Global, its affiliates and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the sole lender.
On January 17, 2020, the Borrowers, and certain material subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second Amended Credit Agreement”) by and among JPMorgan, as Administrative Agent, and certain lender parties thereto, including Comerica Bank.  The Second Amended Credit Agreement provided for (a) a $100 million asset-secured revolving credit facility maturing on November 4, 2022 (the “Facility”), and (b) mortgage-secured Term Loans of $75.6 million. The Second Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated the existing $55.0 million of real estate term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of January 17, 2020, the existing balance of revolving debt under the Amended Credit Agreement, $41.2 million, was rolled over, and an additional $18.7 million available to the Company under the Facility was drawn. The Company used the $75.6 million in mortgage-secured term loans and $18.7 million drawn from the revolving credit facility to fund in part the Acquisition.
Borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Agreement may be used for, among other things, working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries (including permitted acquisitions). The Borrowers have the ability to increase the amount of the Facility, which increases may take the form of increases to the revolving credit commitments, by an aggregate amount of up to $30 million upon satisfaction of customary conditions precedent for such increases, or incremental loans and receipt of additional commitments by one or more existing or new lenders.
Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a floating rate which will be, at the Borrowers’ option, either LIBOR plus 1.375%, or a base rate of prime rate minus 1.125%. The Term Loans bear interest at a floating rate which will be, at the Borrowers’ option, either LIBOR plus 1.875%, or a base rate of prime rate minus 0.625%. A commitment fee of 0.15% is payable monthly in arrears based on the daily amount of the undrawn portion of each lender’s revolving credit commitments under the Facility.
Business Model and Competitive Advantage
We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of products at competitive prices. Since inception, we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors with our distinctive product portfolio, supplier relationships, strategic locations, and technology. Our wide range of Asian Specialty product offerings sets us apart from other mainstream competitors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods Holding Corp., as many of the items we offer are specific to the Chinese restaurant industry. More importantly, our relationships with our suppliers allow us to procure a large variety of products in volume at a low cost. We also import specialized items that would be difficult to procure domestically. With fourteen warehouses and over three hundred trucks executing daily routes within 300 miles of our distribution centers, we offer our customers prompt delivery of high-quality products.
We believe that the following elements of our business model provide us with a competitive advantage and has contributed greatly to our success:
•We offer a wide array of specialty products that are not commonly provided by large distributors serving the mainstream market.
•We have a deep understanding of Chinese culture and most of our employees can speak the native language of our customers.
•We lower our sales and administrative expenses by outsourcing our telephone-based sales and customer service directly to two call centers located in China, which serves our customers with Mandarin and Chinese dialects (Fuzhounese) speaking agents.
•We capitalize on economies of scale and have strong negotiating power with our suppliers.
•We have strategically located distribution centers supported by trucking fleets with most routes limited to 3 to 5 hours driving time, ensuring prompt delivery of our customers orders.
Table of Contents

•With our self-developed proprietary inventory management system, we are able to manage our customer relationships and inventory efficiently and reduce operating expenses.
•Employees’ bilingual capabilities provide a competitive advantage against other major providers in the industry.
We aim to be a nationwide foodservice supplier by expanding geographically into new key markets in the United States where we currently do not have a presence, as well as to strategically consolidate our market leadership position in existing markets through acquisitions. We will also explore potential vertical expansion, both upstream and downstream of the foodservice value chain, including providing value-added items such as semi-prepared food products to help our customers upgrade their service. We continue to build on technological advancement to develop state-of-the-art management information and operating systems to further improve our operational efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. 
Industry and Market Analysis
We distribute food and supplies to Asian/Chinese restaurants, primarily Chinese restaurants that mainly serve non-Chinese Americans, which is a niche market segment of the foodservice distribution industry. The U.S. Food Service Market is one of the largest, valued at USD $3.1 Trillion in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 4.5 Trillion by 2026 (www.verifiedmarketresearch.com). There are several large distributors such as Sysco Corporation, US Foods Holding Corp. and Performance Food Group Company, each capturing a significant market share of the industry by offering food related products and services, or carrying specific products for large chains. However, the Chinese restaurant segment is unique and the restaurants are generally not well served by these mainstream players, thereby create opportunities for specialty players like HF Foods Group to fill the gap.
Features of Chinese Restaurants
Set forth below are the principal characteristics of the Asian/Chinese restaurants we serve.
Primarily Serving Non-Chinese Americans. There are tens of thousands of Chinese restaurants spread throughout the U.S., primarily serving non-Chinese American customers. Although the dishes they serve cater to the preferences of American mainstream customers and are more simply and quickly prepared as compared to traditional full-service Chinese restaurant cuisine, they still require specialized and unique Chinese ingredients with traditional Chinese cooking styles.
Operated by Chinese Individual Families. Most Chinese restaurants serviced by HF Group are generally family-owned with very few workers, who are usually immigrants from China or second generation Chinese Americans. These restaurant owners, especially the founders are generally less sophisticated, with limited education and very limited resources and appreciate value-added services from suppliers to help them improve their operational efficiency. The owners and workers in the Chinese restaurants usually speak Mandarin or other regional dialects of the Chinese language. Understanding the Chinese culture and language is paramount to facilitating efficient communications with customers.
Close-Knit Chinese American Community. Second or third generation Chinese Americans living in the U.S. inherit their traditional cultural, and ethnic languages, and our experience has been that people in these communities prefer to do business with Chinese Americans as opposed to other ethnic groups.
Unique Cooking Style and Ingredients for Chinese Cuisines. Chinese cuisine requires unique cooking techniques such as steaming and stir-frying in Chinese wok, and requires specialty ingredients and vegetables such as bitter melons, Chinese yams, vine spinach, Chinese cabbage and winter melon. It also requires Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices, including peanut oil, cooking wine, vinegar, dark soy source, black bean sauce, pepper oil and chili oil. Most of the unique ingredients for Chinese cuisine are staple supplies of HF Group that are not widely available from mainstream U.S. suppliers.
Growth Potential
Growing Consumption Trend for Food-Away-from-Home (FAFH). According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the percentage of Consumers' spending on FAFH increased dramatically from approximately 27% in 1950 to about 52% in 2015, outpacing spending on Food-At-Home (FAH) for the first time in America history. This powerful trend continued through 2019 which saw FAFH spending accounted for 54.8% of total food expenditures. Although it reversed in 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19, we believe this long-term trend of increasing FAFH consumption will resume and continue to be the key driver of demand for Asian/Chinese restaurants.

Increased Recognition of Chinese Cuisines by Americans. With the growing influence of China’s economy and the Chinese culture globally, and increased tourism and investment into Asia and China from the Western world, more and more Americans are exposed to, and have shown an increased preference for Chinese and Asian cuisine. According to Euromonitor and article published by The Washington Post, Asian food is the fastest growing cuisine in U.S., registering a blistering cumulative growth rate of 135% since 1999 to 2014, outpacing others like Latino and Middle Eastern cuisines. 
We believe that the above-mentioned powerful trends will result in expanded opportunities for Asian/Chinese restaurants, and thus represent tremendous growth opportunity for specialized Asian food distributors like HF Group.
Current Industry Landscape and Opportunities
Natural Culture Barriers to Entry. Understanding Chinese cooking culture is important to run a Chinese restaurant and, therefore, most Chinese restaurants are operated by Chinese Americans. It is very difficult for mainstream food distributors to serve these restaurants because of various cultural and language barriers.
Highly Fragmented Market Segment. The market is currently highly fragmented with many unsophisticated competitors. Most participants are small players such as wholesalers, specialty import brokers, farmers markets, and local produce retailers without the support of sophisticated logistics infrastructure. We believe we are the only Chinese food distributor operating in the United States with such a well-developed logistics infrastructure and experienced management team and that the fragmented market gives us the opportunity to consolidate supply and further develop a dominant market position.
Infrastructure Barriers for New Entrants. The food distribution industry requires large capital investments and resources to build the necessary logistics infrastructure including warehouses and a fleet of trucks to cover its distribution network. In addition, the size of HF Group gives us greater negotiating power with vendors, resulting in price advantages for our customers which we believe are simply not easily achievable by smaller suppliers.
Demand for Value-Added Services. Our customers are Asian/Chinese restaurants, primarily takeout restaurants. These customers are price and quality sensitive and prefer large suppliers with economies of scale to provide them with competitive prices and quality products. Given the limited labor forces and resources of these restaurants, most desire to have more value-added services from the suppliers to help them to operate more efficiently.
In summary, we believe we have numerous advantages to address the current market imperfections and become a national leader in this unique market. With economies of scale, we can provide high quality products at competitive prices in an efficient way.
Business Model
Our business model features an integrated structure with thirteen distribution centers with over one million square feet of total storage space, a fleet of over 300 vehicles for primarily short-distance delivery, and a centralized inventory management and procurement system, supported by two outsourced call centers located in China for customer relationship management. We offer a variety of high-quality products at competitive prices to our customers. Customers can benefit from our efficient supply chain to support their own growth.
We offer one-stop service to Chinese restaurants with over 1,500 types of products, including mainstream products like fresh and frozen meats, frozen seafoods and general commodities, as well as Chinese specialty products like Chinese vegetables, sauces, and packaging materials for takeout restaurants. Chinese restaurants, especially small or takeout restaurants, can find virtually all the products they needed in our product offerings, which can help minimize the effort involved in managing their purchase of inventory. We utilize outsourced call centers in Fuzhou, China, with 24-hour availability for sales and marketing, order placement and post-sales service, which reduces our operating costs, and offers service to our customers in Mandarin, Cantonese and regional Chinese dialects, in addition to English.
We have established a large supplier network and we continue to maintain long-term relationships with many major suppliers. The procurement team was led by Zhou Min Ni and Peter Zhang, co-CEOs of the Company in both 2019 and 2020, who have a deep insight of the industry. Since assuming the role of sole CEO in 2021, Peter Zhang continues to oversee the procurement team. The centralized procurement management system gives us increased negotiating power given the large procurement quantities, improves our turnover of inventory and account payables, and reduces our operating costs.
Products
Table of Contents

We offer over 1,500 different products for our clients, which includes virtually all items needed to operate their business. Products range from perishable produce to takeout food packaging materials. To meet our customers’ demands, we have a large variety and a complete line of products in our inventory. Eighty percent of our sales volume currently consists of domestic goods such as frozen meat and vegetables, which are procured through large suppliers or directly from the producers. The remaining twenty percent are imported specialty products. We provide a full service one-stop-shop for our customers by providing most or all of the products they need, from order placement to delivery and post-sales services. Services to customers are supported by our plentiful physical facilities, vehicles, material handling equipment and techniques, and administrative and operating staffs.
The products we distribute include:
•Asian specialty food items: Asian specialty encompasses any product that has an Asian flair or flavor, including noodles, rice, dry goods (such as dried mushrooms, and dried beans), specialty sauces/ seasonings, spring rolls, and canned products (such as preserved vegetables, bamboo shoots and water chestnut).
•Meat and Poultry: We provide our customers with a variety of beef, pork, chicken and duck products with different brands to choose from, such as Smithfield, Teys Australia and Tyson.
•Seafood: We are committed to providing our customers with the freshest possible seafood. We provide our clients with a variety of seafood including lobster, shrimp, crab, scallops and flavorful fish such as tuna and Alaskan salmon, with different brands to choose from, like Asian Star and Atlantic Bay.
•Fresh Produce: We offer fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables such as celery, Chinese cabbage, and winter melon, which are widely used in Chinese cuisines.
•Packaging and Other Items: We offer a wide range of take-out accessories for customers, from bamboo chopsticks to takeout containers, plastic cups and sushi combo boxes.
•Commodities: True commodity products such as regular rice, flour, sugar and oil are classified as “commodity”.
The following table sets forth sales percentage by category for the year ended December 31, 2020:

Category | Percentage
Asian Specialty | 30 | %
Meat and Poultry | 26 | %
Seafood | 14 | %
Fresh Produce | 13 | %
Packaging and Others | 11 | %
Commodity | 6 | %

Customer Service
We utilize outsourced call centers located in China to manage our sales order, customer development, sales promotion and post-sales services. The outsourced call centers are located in Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province of China, with local employees speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, regional Chinese dialects (Fuzhounese) and English. By offering the customer service in their native language, the sales staff can communicate smoothly and efficiently with our clients and understand their needs. With cultural understanding and a common language, the sales team can design a product portfolio for our customers and use a precision marketing strategy to promote our products. China, where our two call centers are located, has lower prevailing wages compared to the US. The strategic decision to outsource customer service to China not only enables the Company to provide around the clock service in our customer's native tongue, but also allows the Company to better manage costs. One of the call centers, Hanfeng (Fujian) Information Technology Co., Ltd ("HFFIT"), is a related party to our former Chairman and Co-CEO, Zhou Min Ni. Refer to Note 16 for more details.
We also have a domestic sales team in the U.S., with sales agents that make on-site visits to customers’ restaurants, in order to gain a better understanding of customers’ operations and needs.
Currently, we maintain our sales department, which involves decision-making for sales strategies and supervision of sales performance by our key sales managers, in our corporate headquarters in City of Industry, California and regional office in 
Table of Contents

Greensboro, North Carolina. The sales managers work closely with the sales staff in China to ensure our market strategies are implemented effectively. Our plan is to further integrate our operating model with the outsourced call centers to expand our business and operate even more efficiently.
A proprietary information system is used to maintain each customer’s records, including location, size, contact information, purchasing history, preferences, orders and payment records. Customers can directly call the outsourced call centers in China or our domestic sales team to inquire about products and to place orders. Once orders are confirmed, electronic sales orders are generated by the information system and sent to the distribution center designated to the customer. Upon receipt of the sales orders, products are pulled from the shelves and moved to a staging area at the loading docks. Products are then loaded into delivery vehicles in preparation for delivery. Products are generally delivered to customers within only two days of an order. Customer analysis can be generated through the information system and prompts the salesperson to follow up with customers for product promotion, post-sales services and the taking of new orders.
We offer a refund policy for non-satisfaction without penalty, which many of our small competitors in the market segment are unable to provide. We provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee to our customer. When a shipment is made and the products are not to the standards of the customer, we allow our customers to reject the order in whole or in part with no penalty within 24 hours. The non-penalty refund policy works to help us earn the trust and loyalty of our customers.
Inventory Procurement
The Company utilizes centralized procurement on bulk and frequently sold items. Subsidiaries send their inventory procurement requests to headquarters and regional offices where the operation team is responsible for fulfillment in the most cost-effective way. The centralized procurement allows HF Group to establish a meaningful vendor relationship under one brand.
We maintain a large supplier network through a vendor pool with a carefully selected group of suppliers to ensure product quality, availability and competitive pricing. Eighty percent of sales volume currently consists of domestic goods such as frozen meat and vegetables, which are procured through large suppliers or directly from the producers. The remaining twenty percent are imported specialty products. To minimize costs, the procurement team directly manages our major vendors for large and frequent purchases and engages brokers for our smaller suppliers of specialty goods. Utilizing brokers allows us to maintain lower costs due to the brokers’ volume.
The key procurement team members closely monitor the supply market for seasonal products such as vegetables and make procurement adjustments according to market conditions. In addition, they use a dual-sourcing method for their suppliers and can negotiate lower prices for comparable products.
Each distribution center reviews the inventory level in the information system daily and submits purchase requests as needed to the procurement team at headquarters and regional offices. The procurement team at headquarter and regional office also can alter or adjust purchasing decisions based on an analysis of the inventory data in the system. Upon receipt of ordered products, the delivery schedule is determined based on the needs of each location. The lead-time for products is dependent on the product category and need. For perishable goods, products are usually delivered by suppliers within 72 hours of placing the order. Products that are ordered through import brokers have lead times of up to seven days.
None of our suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our aggregate purchases during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020.
Warehousing
We use our information system for warehouse management with daily inventory monitoring. The system allows us to manage our inventory in an efficient way. It optimizes the inventory level and turnover, reducing waste, and helps to reduce labor costs to track and record the inventory.
Inventory levels are maintained based on the category of products. Perishable goods are kept in the refrigerated warehouse for a period of no more than 7 days. This includes fresh produce and fresh meat products. Frozen produce, seafood and meat products are kept in the freezer to extend shelf life. Frozen products usually turn over between 30 and 60 days. Non-perishable goods are held in greater quantities of inventory based on the pricing of the market. Non-perishable items are carefully monitored for pricing changes. As they have an extended shelf life, there is an advantage to ordering larger quantities of stock. Non-perishable goods generally turn over in approximately 3 weeks, which we believe is average for distributors of similar size. Maintaining this level of inventory allows us to manage any surges in demand.
Table of Contents

Products are stored in warehouses through our various distribution centers. A routine inventory count is taken to ensure stock quantity and replenishment needs. Forty percent of the inventory consists of fresh meats and produce, of which is counted daily. The other sixty percent consists of frozen and dry goods with cycle counts every two weeks. Non-perishable items are stored on racks until their shelf life is reached or the product is sold, whichever comes first. Products are broken down from their pallets and sold in their original packaging. Items stored in the warehouses are not removed from their original packaging. Each package is sold as one unit and priced accordingly.
Locations
We currently have thirteen distribution centers with a total of over one million square feet of storage, including refrigerated storage of over 320,000 square feet. The distribution centers are located on the route of many of our suppliers; product delivery can be made seamlessly to each location with one large order. Each warehouse is equipped with multiple loading docks, allowing simultaneous parallel loading of products onto the trucks. Warehouse locations are also located in industrial regions, allowing large delivery trucks to enter without the need of acquiring permits.
It is important for us to strategically place our warehouses within certain markets to maximize our market share. We currently strategically place our warehouses within markets that are not saturated and have limited competitors. This allows us to quickly penetrate the market and develop customer relationships that will assist in promotion of products and provide post-sales services. Upon penetrating the market, we seek to expand our warehouses into regional areas in order to streamline our distribution network. This strategy is designed to improve the delivery routes and maximize the utilization of our delivery vehicles.
The table below summarizes certain details of our distribution centers:

Fleet Management
We currently operate a fleet of over 300 refrigerated vehicles. Vehicles range from vans, 16-foot semi-delivery trucks, to 53-foot refrigerated trucks and trailer units. These vehicles are maintained by both in-house and external mechanics and follow a strict maintenance schedule. Each vehicle has a 7-year life cycle of approximately 250,000 miles. Each vehicle is refueled daily upon return from its delivery route. 
Promotion and Marketing
We do not advertise in the media or magazines. We believe that it is more efficient and cost effective to promote our business through telemarketing, online platform and have our drivers promote our business while executing deliveries. Our drivers visit the Chinese/Asian restaurants along their delivery routes and are trained to market our products and our online ordering

platform to both existing customers and non-customers along their routes. Telemarketing is conducted by salespersons from the outsourced call centers in China.

Competition
The foodservice distribution industry is large and highly competitive. There are a few very large distributors serving the mainstream U.S. market. However, with natural cultural and language barriers, it has been a challenge for the the mainstream foodservice distributors to capture a meaningful market share for Chinese restaurants. Management believes that the market participants in the niche market segment that we are serving is highly fragmented and immature. With the continuing growth of demand for Chinese cuisine, we believe that this industry sector has significant opportunity for consolidation.
The competitors serving the industry sector for Chinese restaurants include a large number of small wholesalers, some medium-sized distributors, as well as large established market players. However, we believe there is no dominating market provider in this segment. Our customers also make purchases from local farms, retailers and grocery stores. Small wholesalers sometimes supply the same specialized items such as spices, specialized sauces, and specialty foods, which we carry, but these small suppliers are not able to offer the same broad base and wide array of products that we do. Compared with the medium-sized distributors and large mainstream market players, we have the advantages of offering a broad line of both staple and niche products, efficient operation infrastructure, and cultural understanding to maintain our market position and continue to grow our business.

Government Regulation
Legal compliance is important to our operations. We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous jurisdictions in which we do business.
As a marketer and distributor of food products in the United States, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.
The recently published and pending rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) will significantly expand food safety requirements, including those of the Company. Among other things, FDA regulations implementing the FSMA require us to establish and maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA also imposes new requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority.
The Company and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals which may be present in products that we distribute.
Our distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. Further, we are required to establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
Our business and employment practices are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which collectively regulate our trucking business through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar

state statutes, which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments.
Our operations are also subject to a broad range of U.S. federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as zoning and building regulations. Environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; properly handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products. As of December 31, 2020, the costs of managing our compliance with environmental laws and regulations was nominal.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We have implemented appropriate policy and will continue to maintain a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our operations.
For the purchase of items produced, harvested or manufactured outside of the United States, we are subject to applicable customs laws regarding the import and export of various products. Certain activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to applicable regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security.
