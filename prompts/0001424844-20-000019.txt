Item 1.   Business.
    The Company is an Iowa limited liability company located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, formed in March, 2005. The Company is permitted to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol.  We began producing ethanol in February, 2009 and sell our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil in the United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.  
    Our production facility (the “Facility”) is located in Pottawattamie County in southwestern Iowa, south of Council Bluffs. It is near two major interstate highways, I-29 and I-80, within a mile of the Missouri River and has access to five major rail carriers. This location is in close proximity to a significant amount of corn and has convenient product market access. The Facility receives corn and chemical deliveries primarily by truck and is able to utilize rail delivery if necessary.  Finished products are shipped by rail and truck.  The site has access to water from ground wells and from the Missouri River.  Additionally, in close proximity to the Facility’s primary energy source (steam), there are two natural gas providers available, both with infrastructure immediately accessible to the Facility.
Financial Information
    Please refer to “Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities, and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
A novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then, several world governments, including the United States and many individual states and municipalities, have imposed lock-downs, self-quarantine requirements, and travel restrictions on their citizens. These actions have dramatically decreased the demand for and price of blended gasoline across the globe and in the United States. Because the United States requires ethanol to be blended into the nation’s fuel supplies, gasoline consumption and demand plays a key role in the demand for and price of ethanol.
Operations
Throughout most of 2018 and 2019 as well as early 2020, the Company, and the ethanol industry as a whole, experienced significant adverse conditions as a result of industry-wide record low ethanol prices due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels. These factors, which have been compounded by the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, resulted and continue to result in lower operating margins, lower cash flow from operations and net losses. In response to these adverse market conditions, commencing in the middle of March 2020, we elected to reduce ethanol production at our plant by approximately fifty percent in the month of April. During May and June 2020, we also operated our plant at lower than normal ethanol production levels. However, we ramped up production from June through September and began operating at normal levels compared to early 2020. Management believes that this reduction was warranted due to negative margins in the ethanol industry resulting in part from a slowdown in global and regional economic activity and decreased ethanol demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Limiting ethanol production also resulted in a corresponding decrease in distillers grains and corn oil production. The Company will continue to monitor COVID-19 developments and the effect on fuel demand and terminal capacity in order to determine whether further adjustments to production will be necessary. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to temporary regulatory relief issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), several ethanol plants and industrial chemical companies have found ways to process ethanol into hand sanitizer for medical and consumer applications. During our period of reduced production, the Company found several customers seeking ethanol in bulk for use in hand sanitizers. The Company also bottled "SIREtizer" hand sanitizer for local distribution. Given the economic conditions and the unprecedented decrease in the price and demand for blended gasoline, the Company was able to command a higher margin supplying ethanol for use in hand sanitizer products than for its conventional ethanol product. The Company produced and sold ethanol based hand sanitizer as a new line of business in the months of April and May. However, in June 2020, the FDA tightened the temporary regulatory language such that certain ethanol plants, including the Company, halted production and cancelled supply agreements for ethanol used in hand sanitizer. 
Employee Health and Safety
From the earliest signs of the outbreak, we have taken proactive action to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. We enacted appropriate safety measures, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present at the plant, and staggering schedules and shifts for those that must be on-site to perform their work, and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and requiring employees who must be physically present at the plant to wear masks. The Company also suspended all plant tours, and instituted a policy for contractor/vendors to answer a health questionnaire and provide information about the work environment where they have been for the past fourteen days. We expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business, and we may take further 
actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. 
Supply and Demand Impact
Although we continue to regularly monitor the financial health of companies in our supply chain, financial hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to produce our products, adversely affecting our operations, even when operating at reduced production levels. Additionally, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of truck, rail or air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, may result in higher costs and delays, both on obtaining raw materials and shipping finished products to customers, which could harm our profitability, make our products less competitive, or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers.
The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. We anticipate that the current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 will cause a global economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. In the event of a recession, demand for our products would decline and our business would be adversely effected.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
On April 15, 2020, the Company received $1.1 million under the new Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP Loan") legislation passed in response to the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19. Our PPP Loan may be forgiven based upon various factors, including, without limitation, our payroll cost over an eight to twenty-four week period starting upon our receipt of the funds. Expenses for approved payroll costs, lease payments on agreements before February 15, 2020 and utility payments under agreements before February 1, 2020 and certain other specified costs can be paid with these funds and eligible for payment forgiveness by the federal government. At least 60% of the proceeds must be used for approved payroll costs, and no more than 40% on non-payroll expenses. Management believes that our use of our PPP Loan proceeds for the approved expense categories will be fully forgiven.. 
Outlook
Although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the recent COVID-19 outbreak on our future results, we believe our current cash reserves, cash generated from our operations, our PPP Loan and the available cash under our revolving term loan leave us well-positioned to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are broad-reaching and the financial impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to, reduced production levels, lower net sales and potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic, including storage and logistics costs and other expenses. As a result, although we were in compliance with our financial covenants set forth in our loan agreements (the "FCSA Credit Facility") with Farm Credit Services of America, FLCA (“FCSA”) and CoBank, ACB (“CoBank”) as of September 30, 2020, the impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our operating results which could result in our inability to comply with certain of these financial covenants and require our lenders to waive compliance with, or agree to amend, any such covenant to avoid a default. However, based on our current forecast of market conditions and our financial performance, we expect that we will be in a position to satisfy all of the financial covenants in our FCSA Credit Facility for the next twelve months.
The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, and actions that would be taken by governmental authorities to contain the pandemic or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to forecast any effects on our fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021") results, including our results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. However, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly as the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 progressed in response to the global resurgence of COVID-19 and the extension of, enhancement of, or imposition of new, government measures aimed at curbing the pandemic including lock-downs, self-quarantine requirements, and travel restrictions. As of the date of this filing, management does not anticipate material improvement in the macroeconomic environment during the first or second quarter of Fiscal 2021 and, as a result our results for Fiscal 2021 may also be affected. 
Despite the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to improve on our operational efficiencies and diversify our products which is critical in order to drive positive results in a low margin environment. Our management team is currently in the process of implementing several projects to enhance our plant's operational efficiencies and we also continue to evaluate opportunities to add value to our 
production process by diversifying into high protein feed along with measures to reduce the carbon index ("CI") of the ethanol we produce. 
In addition, we are also continuing with our efforts to de-bottleneck the production process. In September 2019, we placed into service a membrane dehydration technology that allows for an increase in dehydration capacity and a reduction in our CI score.
Also, we believe that consolidation within the ethanol industry, coupled with our location, good operating efficiencies and our solid team may provide new opportunities for our plant.
We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. 
Rail Access
    We own a six mile loop railroad track for rail service to our Facility, which accommodates several unit trains.  We are party to an Industrial Track Agreement with CBEC Railway, Inc. (the “Track Agreement “), which governs our use of the loop railroad and requires, among other things, that we maintain the loop track.
    On March 24, 2019 the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Railcar Lease Agreement (“Railcar Agreement”) with Bunge North America, Inc. (“Bunge”), for the lease of 323 ethanol cars and 111 hopper cars which are used for the delivery and marketing of our ethanol and distillers grains. Bunge was a related party until December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Bunge Repurchase Agreement") effective December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased the 3,334 Series B membership units owned by Bunge. 
The Railcar Agreement was amended to 110 hopper cars effective November 2019 and effective July 17, 2020, Bunge sold their tankers to Trinity Leasing. Trinity Leasing entered into a lease agreement with the Company which incorporates the terms of the original Bunge Railcar Agreement but reduced the ethanol car level to 320 ethanol cars. Under the Railcar Agreement, the original DOT111 tank cars are leased over a four year term from March 24, 2019 to April 30, 2023, with the ability to start returning cars after January 1, 2023 to conform to the requirement for DOT117 tank cars with enhanced safety specifications which is scheduled to be effective in May 2023. The 110 hopper cars are leased over a three year term running from March 24, 2019 to March 31, 2022 which term will continue on a month-to-month basis thereafter. The amendments to the Railcar Agreement lowered the cost for the leases by approximately 20% as compared to the prior lease terms. Pursuant to the terms of a side letter to the Railcar Agreement, we sublease cars to other companies from time to time when the cars are not needed in our operations. We work with the lessor to determine the most economic use of the available ethanol and hopper cars in light of then current market conditions. In February 2019, we entered into a second 36 month lease for an additional 30 tank cars from an unrelated third party leasing company (this was in addition to the 30 non-insulated tank cars leased from that company signed December 2015). This agreement expired in June of 2020, and was converted to a month-to-month basis. These 30 tank cars will be returned during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021.
Employees
    We had 60 full time employees, as of September 30, 2020.  We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  Our management considers our employee relationships to be favorable.
Principal Products
    The principal products we produce are ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, and carbon dioxide ("CO2").
Ethanol

    Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute.  More than 99% of all ethanol produced in the United States is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products.  The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline marketers or blenders.  Ethanol is shipped by truck in the local markets, and by rail in the regional, national and international markets.
    We produced 117.8 million and 129.3 million gallons of ethanol for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020") and September 30, 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”), respectively, and approximately 74.3% and 75.4% of our revenue was derived from the sale of ethanol in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The decrease in gallons produced and our revenues from ethanol sales during Fiscal 2020 resulted principally from our strategic reductions in production levels in response to unfavorable operating conditions in the ethanol industry and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Distillers Grain
 The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed marketed primarily to the beef and dairy industries.  Distillers grains contain by-pass protein that is superior to other protein supplements such as cottonseed meal and soybean meal.  We produce two forms of distillers grains: wet distillers grains with solubles (“WDGS”) and dried distillers grains with solubles (“DDGS”).  WDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% to 65% moisture.  WDGS have a shelf life of approximately seven days and are sold to local markets.  DDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has a longer shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market.
    In Fiscal 2020, we sold 5.7% fewer tons of distillers grains compared to Fiscal 2019. Approximately 20.0% and 19.0% of our revenue was derived from the sale of distillers grains in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The decrease in distillers grains produced and sold during Fiscal 2020 resulted principally from our strategic reductions in production levels in response to unfavorable operating conditions in the ethanol industry and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Corn Oil

    Our system separates corn oil from the post-fermentation syrup stream as it leaves the evaporators of the ethanol plant. The corn oil is then routed to storage tanks, and the remaining concentrated syrup is routed to the plant’s syrup tank. Corn oil can be marketed as either a feed additive or a biodiesel feedstock.  We sold 9.8% fewer tons of corn oil in Fiscal 2020 than in Fiscal 2019, with approximately 5.0% and 5.1% of our revenue generated from corn oil sales, respectively.
Carbon Dioxide
In April 2013, we entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “CO2 Agreement”) with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., formerly known as EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. ("Air Products") under which we agreed to supply, and Air Products agreed to purchase, a portion of raw CO2 gas produced by our facility. In addition, we entered into a Non-Exclusive CO2 Facility Site Lease Agreement under which we granted Air Products a non-exclusive right of entry and license to construct, maintain and operate a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant (the “CO2 Plant”) on a site near our facility. The term of the CO2 Agreement runs for ten (10) years from the startup of the CO2 Plant (the “Initial Term”) and then renews automatically for two (2) additional five (5) year periods thereafter, unless written notice of termination is submitted within six (6) months prior to the end of the then current term.
Air Products pays us a base price per ton, which acts as a floor price, Air Products will pay us an additional amount based on Air Products profits above a minimum targeted margin. The CO2 Agreement also contains a take or pay obligation pursuant to which Air Products agrees to pay us for a minimum number of tons each year. CO2 was 0.4% of our revenue for Fiscal 2020 and 0.3% in Fiscal 2019.
Principal Product Markets
    As described below in “Distribution Methods,” we market and distribute all of our ethanol through Bunge pursuant to the terms of the Restated Ethanol Agreement effective Jauary 1, 2020.  Distiller grains were handled through Bunge during the first half of our fiscal year pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Distiller’s Grain Purchase Agreement dated December 5, 2014 (the "DG Purchase Agreement"). The DG Purchase Agreement expired December 31, 20219; however, as part of the Bunge Repurchase Agreement, Bunge agreed to provide transition services until March 31, 2020 for all duties and responsibilities under the original DG Purchase Agreement. The Company is now responsible for all duties and responsibilities previously performed by Bunge under the DG Purchase Agreement. 
Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We explore all markets for our distillers grains and corn oil products, and we expect Bunge to explore all markets for our ethanol, including export markets. We believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products; however, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
    According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the "EIA"), in the first eight months of 2020, ethanol exports decreased 10% as compared to the first eight months of 2019. Canada has moved to the top spot as the country that imports the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States. Brazil moved back to second place, as tariffs implemented by Brazil on U.S. ethanol imports have significantly reduced Brazilian demand. India remains the third largest destination of U.S. ethanol exports. Exports of U.S. ethanol to these three countries constitute almost 58% of all U.S. ethanol exports. South Korea and Mexico represent the remaining countries in the top 5 for destinations for U.S. ethanol exports in the first eight months of 2020. 
    Brazilian demand fell from 31% of U.S. ethanol exports in 2019 to 20% in 2020. Ethanol exports to Brazil continue to be impacted by the tariff on U.S. ethanol imports. The effect of the tariff has been mitigated somewhat by the adoption of a rate tariff quota that allows 750 million liters of ethanol annually to be shipped into Brazil before the tariff applies. However, this rate tariff quota currently is set to expire in December 2020 (extended 90 days from the original expiration on August 30, 2020). The Brazilian Chamber of Foreign Trade ("CAMEX") extended the free quota in anticipation of potential trade talks with the U.S .to negotiate import/export issues which are expected to commence in the fourth calendar quarter of 2020. There is no guarantee that the trade talks will result in a further extension of the rate tariff quota and the impact of the tariff should the rate tariff quota be allowed to expire could be significant and may result in further decreases in exports of U.S. ethanol to Brazil. 
    Similar to Brazil, tariffs implemented by China on U.S. ethanol have essentially eliminated China as an export market for U.S. ethanol. China was included in the top export markets during the first half of 2018; however, approximately 99% of the exports to China occurred in the first three months of 2018 and since then, U.S. ethanol exports to China have been reduced to almost nothing due to increased tariffs. On December 13, 2019, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to the first phase of a trade deal (the "Phase One Agreement") where China agreed to purchase billions of dollars in agricultural products in exchange for the U.S. agreeing not to pursue a new round of tariffs starting January 2020. After the pandemic hit the U.S,, relations between the two countries have been strained, and the impact on the ethanol market cannot be determined at this time. However, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, through October 2020 China has only purchased approximately 56% of its year-to-date commitments under the Phase One Agreement, and there can be no certainty at this time of whether its buying will improve.
 Ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand, and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For instance, a strong U.S. Dollar is an example of a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. In addition, the Chinese and Brazil tariffs have had, and likely will continue to have, a negative impact on the export market demand and prices for ethanol produced in the United States. There is also potential for the imposition of tariffs by other countries in addition to Brazil and China due to trade disputes with the United States which could reduce the overall export demand and therefore could have a negative impact on ethanol prices.
    Distillers grains have become more accepted as animal feed throughout the world and therefore, distillers grains exports have increased and may continue to increase as worldwide acceptance grows. However, according to the U.S. Grains Council (the "USGC"), U.S. distillers grains annual exports through July 31, 2020 were approximately 3% lower than distillers grains exports for the same seven month period last year. The decrease experienced during the first seven months of 2020 is even greater when taking into consideration the fact that 2019 had 5% fewer distillers grains exports than 2018. Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Canada remain the top destinations for U.S. distillers grains exports.
    Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China; however, exports to China have significantly decreased as a result of the Chinese anti-dumping and countervailing investigations and the implementation of significant duties on importing into China distillers grains produced in the United States. The imposition of these duties resulted in materially decreased demand from China requiring U.S. producers to seek out alternative export markets, including Mexico, Canada and Vietnam In addition, recent trade disputes with other countries have created additional uncertainty as to future export demand for U.S. distillers grains.
    We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users or middlemen within the domestic market. Corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.
    We sell carbon dioxide directly to Air Products.
Distribution Methods
    On December 5, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Ethanol Purchase Agreement with Bunge which was further amended and restated on October 23, 2017 to include specific provisions for loading and shipment of ethanol 
by truck (the “Ethanol Agreement”). Under the Ethanol Agreement, the Company agreed to sell Bunge all of the ethanol produced by the Company, and Bunge agreed to purchase the same.  The Company paid Bunge a percentage fee for ethanol sold by Bunge, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Ethanol Agreement expired on December 31, 2019. As part of the Bunge Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Bunge Repurchase Agreement"), the parties entered into a restated Ethanol Agreement effective January 1, 2020 (the "Restated Ethanol Agreement") which provides that the Company will pay Bunge a flat monthly marketing fee. The term of the Restated Ethanol Agreement expires on December 31, 2026. 
    We were a party to a Distillers Grain Purchase Agreement, as amended (“DG Agreement”) with Bunge, under which Bunge was obligated to purchase from us and we were obligated to sell to Bunge all distillers grains produced at our Facility. Under the DG Agreement, Bunge paid us a purchase price equal to the sales price minus the marketing fee and transportation costs.  The sales price was the price received by Bunge in a contract consistent with the DG Marketing Policy or the spot price agreed to between Bunge and the Company. Bunge received a marketing fee consisting of a percentage of the net sales price, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. Net sales price is the sales price less the transportation costs and rail lease charges.  The transportation costs were all freight charges, fuel surcharges, and other access charges applicable to delivery of distillers grains.  The initial term of the DG Agreement expired on December 31, 2019; however, as part of the Bunge Repurchase Agreement, Bunge agreed to provide transition services until March 31, 2020 for all duties and responsibilities of the DG Purchase Agreement. The Company is now responsible for all duties and responsibilities previously performed by Bunge under the DG Purchase Agreement. 
Rail lease charges are the monthly lease payment for rail cars along with all administrative and tax filing fees for such leased rail cars.
     We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to buyers within the domestic market.
Raw Materials
Corn Requirements

    The principal raw material necessary to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn which are affected by supply and demand factors such as crop production, carryout, exports, government policies and programs, risk management and weather.  With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers grain during times of higher corn prices. However, given that ethanol sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.
    High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. During Fiscal 2020, corn prices were lower compared to Fiscal 2019 due primarily to a slowdown in the domestic and worldwide economy due to the pandemic. Total use was down 3% for the year, as industrial use, ethanol use and exports were all lower than originally forecasted. In November 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) revised their estimates for the 2020/2021 corn production to decrease its forecast to 14.7 billion bushels which is down approximately 1.2% from the October forecast. Based on November 1 conditions, the USDA left forecasts of average corn yields unchanged at 178 bushels per acre. The USDA forecast for area harvested for corn reduced the area harvested to 82.5 million acres which is down 1.0 million acres from the prior months' forecast.
    Our management expects that corn prices will remain steady or move slightly higher through the first two quarters of Fiscal 2021 as a result of the lower levels of production and yield forecasted by the USDA, as well as carryover levels from the prior year. However, if corn prices rise more than expected, it will have an adverse impact on our operating margins unless the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains are able to outpace the rising corn prices. Management continually monitors corn prices and the availability of corn near the Facility and also continually attempts to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on profitability through its risk management strategies, including hedging positions taken in the corn market. 
 Our Facility would need approximately 48.3 million bushels of corn annually, to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol, or approximately 132,300 bushels per day.  During Fiscal 2020 we purchased 9.5% less corn compared to Fiscal 2019, which was obtained entirely from local markets.  The Company and Bunge were also parties to an Amended and Restated Grain Feedstock Agency Agreement (the “Agency Agreement”).  The Agency Agreement provided that Bunge procure corn for the Company and the Company pay Bunge a per bushel fee, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of 
the Agency Agreement expired on December 31, 2019; however, as part of the Bunge Repurchase Agreement, Bunge agreed to provide transition services until March 31, 2020 for all duties and responsibilities of the Agency Agreement. The Company is now responsible for all duties and responsibilities previously performed by Bunge under the Agency Agreement. 
    Starting with the 2015 crop year, the Company began using corn containing Syngenta Seeds, Inc.’s proprietary Enogen® technology (“Enogen Corn”) for a portion of its ethanol production needs. The Company contracted directly with growers to produce Enogen Corn for sale to the Company. Bunge and the Company were also parties to a Services Agreement regarding corn purchases (the “Services Agreement ”) under which we originated all Enogen Corn contracts for our Facility and Bunge assisted us with certain administrative matters related to Enogen Corn, including facilitating delivery to our Facility. The initial term of the Services Agreement expired on December 31, 2019, and the Company notified Bunge of its election not to extend the Services Agreement, but to allow corn planted this fiscal year to be planted and harvested under the terms of the Services Agreement. Expenses under the Services Agreement were included as part of the Amended and Restated Grain Feedstock Agency Agreement discussed above.
Energy Requirements

    The production of ethanol is an energy intensive process which uses significant amounts of electricity and steam or natural gas as a heat source.  Presently, about 24,000 MMBTUs of energy are required to produce a gallon of ethanol.  It is our goal to operate the plant as safely and profitably as possible, optimizing the amount of energy consumed per gallon of ethanol produced, balanced with the relative values of WDGS as compared to DDGS.  
    In September 2019, the Company went on line with the Whitefox Integrated Cartridge Efficiency (ICE) system to push towards more efficient operations in our plant. This technology benefits the plant through energy reduction, purity flexibility and debottlenecking of the distillation and dehydration processes. Energy efficiency improved by approximately 1,000 BTU's per gallon of ethanol produced, which results in steam savings and carbon emission reductions In April 2020, the Company implemented Bioleap's Dryer Exhaust Energy Recovers ("DEER"). The DEER system reduces the steam load on the boilers, providing immediate energy savings and freeing up capacity on the current boiler system. The change in the source blend for steam from approximately 50% natural gas and 50% steam in Fiscal 2019 to 95% natural gas and 5% steam in Fiscal 2020 impacted the energy costs for the Company due to the lower cost of natural gas as compared to steam which benefits were partially offset as the natural gas boilers are less efficient than the steam line.
Steam

    Unlike most ethanol producers in the United States which use natural gas as their primary energy source, we have access to steam as a one of our energy sources in addition to natural gas. Historically, we have changed between steam and natural gas depending on energy costs and other factors.  We believe our ability to utilize steam makes us more competitive, as under certain energy market conditions our energy costs will be lower than natural gas fired plants.  We have entered into a Steam Service Contract (“Steam Contract”) with MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAm”), under which MidAm provides us the steam required by us, up to 475,000 pounds per hour.  The Steam Contract links our net energy rates and charges for steam to certain specified energy indexes, subject to certain minimum and maximum rates, so that our steam costs remain competitive with the general energy market. The Steam Contract expires in November 2024. During Fiscal 2020, we purchased approximately 90.9% less steam compared to Fiscal 2019. The decrease in Fiscal 2020 was due to a contractual obligation specified in our contract with MidAm and their plant availability. The price for steam decreased 5.6% in Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019. Steam availability from MidAm continues to be volatile as a result of MidAm’s increased utilization of wind energy, rather than coal, since Fiscal 2017.
Natural Gas

    Although steam has traditionally been considered our primary energy source, natural gas accounted for approximately 93.2% of our energy usage in Fiscal 2020, compared to 50.6% in Fiscal 2019. The increase in our natural gas usage was due to decreased steam availability and obligations specified in our contract with MidAm, and a reduction in natural gas prices of over 18% when comparing Fiscal 2020 with Fiscal 2019. We have two natural gas boilers for use when our steam service is temporarily unavailable. Natural gas is also needed for incidental purposes.  We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Encore Energy in April of 2012 to fulfill our natural gas needs at the Gas Daily Midpoint pricing.  
Electricity

    Our Facility requires a large continuous supply of electrical energy.  In Fiscal 2020 we used approximately 7.3% less electricity compared to Fiscal 2019. This was primarily due to lower production levels during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019.
Water

    We require a supply of water typical for the industry for our production process.  Our primary water source comes from the underground Missouri River aquifer via our three onsite wells. The majority of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the plant.  All our ground water is treated through our onsite water oxidation system. This filtered water is used throughout our process. We do treat (polish) some of this filtered water for boiler and cooling tower make-up with our Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to minimize any elements that will harm the boiler and steam systems as permitted.  We send some of our non-process contact water back to the Missouri River.  The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation and cooling.  We also evaporate much of our water through our dryer system for dried corn distillers grains.  The rest of our process water is recycled back into the plant, which minimizes waste of our water supply.

Other parties’ marks referred to in this report are the property of their respective owners. We were granted a perpetual license by ICM, Inc. (“ICM”) to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our Facility.  There is no ongoing fee or definitive calendar term for this license.
Seasonality of Sales
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 
Risk Management and Hedging Transactions
    The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers grain and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  Although we believe that our hedging strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.
    Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers grains.
    We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
    As discussed above, we have marketing and agency agreements with Bunge for the purpose of marketing and distributing our ethanol product.   Currently, we do not have the ability to market our ethanol internally should Bunge be unable or refuse to market our ethanol at acceptable prices. However, we anticipate that we would be able to very quickly secure competitive marketers should we need to replace Bunge for any reason.
We previously relied on Bunge for the sale and distribution of our distillers grains. However, our DG Purchase Agreement with Bunge expired on December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the Bunge Repurchase Agreement, Bunge provided transition services until March 31, 2020 for all duties and responsibilities previously performed by Bunge under the DG Purchase Agreement. The Company is now responsible for all duties and responsibilities previously performed by Bunge under the DG Purchase Agreement. 
In Fiscal 2020, Bunge constituted 83% of total revenues, compared to almost 95% of revenue in Fiscal 2019.
Competition 
Domestic Ethanol Competitors
    The ethanol we produce is similar to ethanol produced by other domestic plants.  At the end of 2019, the Renewable Fuels Association ("RFA") estimated that there were 203 installed ethanol production facilities in the United States with a total capacity of 16.6 billion gallons based on nameplate capacity and seven additional plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 270 million gallons. The ethanol industry is experiencing the lowest margin environment seen in the past nine to ten years principally due to the fact that the supply of ethanol is outstripping demand and markets are reacting accordingly by disincentivizing production. Commencing in March 2020, the COVID-19 virus impact upon the economy drove the price of gasoline downwards, and the price of ethanol plummeted to or below production costs. In response, many plants in the U.S. shut down production or cut production levels. According to the RFA, since March 1, 2020, 69 ethanol plants with annual production capacity of nearly 6 billing gallons have been fully idled, 64 plants have reduced production levels from 10% to 50% representing an additional 1.7 billion gallons of reduced ethanol production. Although there has been a steady recovery of production levels from late April 2020 through June 2020 there are still about two dozen plants idled and a majority of facilities running slightly below normal production levels. With most plants running at about 10% of pre COVID-19 production levels since June 2020, the RFA estimates that currently total idled capacity represents about 2.5 billion gallons of annual production. Adding to the supply/demand imbalance is the stance taken by the EPA under the Trump Administration with regard to the issuance of “hardship waivers” to so-called small refineries. In our fiscal fourth quarter, some plants started to increase production and bring plants back on board, but industry information has not quantified the recent buildup.
    Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominately based on price. The top five producers account for almost half of domestic production. We are in direct competition with many of these top five producers as well as other national producers, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we have and each of which is producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. In addition, we believe that the ethanol industry will continue to consolidate leading to a market where a small number of large ethanol producers with substantial production capacities will control an even larger portion of the U.S. ethanol production. In recent years, the ethanol industry has also seen increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year.
    We may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors and the oil companies who are capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol, have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain efficiencies and other benefits that we cannot achieve with one ethanol plant or are able to operate at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. For instance, ethanol producers that own multiple plants may be able to compete in the marketplace more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable, because they have the flexibility to run certain production facilities while reducing production or shutting down production at other facilities. These large producers may also be able to realize economies of scale which we are unable to realize or they may have better negotiating positions with purchasers.  Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could create competitive advantages over us.
Foreign Ethanol Competitors

    In recent years, the ethanol industry has experienced increased competition from international suppliers of ethanol and although ethanol imports have decreased during the past few years, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again, such increased imports could negatively impact demand for domestic ethanol which could adversely impact our financial 
results. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. 
    Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugarcane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.
    Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producer. Brazil makes ethanol primarily from sugarcane as opposed to corn, and depending on feedstock prices, may be less expensive to produce. Several large companies produce ethanol in Brazil, including affiliates of Bunge. Brazilian imports account for less than 1% of U.S. ethanol consumed. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of the Renewable Fuel Standard (the "RFS") as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for certain obligated parties to comply with the RFS requirement to blend 5 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. 
    In order to address supply issues after the sugarcane harvest, some Brazilian ethanol plants have become "flex plants" enabling them to process year round with local corn as well as sugarcane. Two new processing plants finished construction which will substantially increase Brazilian ethanol production and thereby increase the inventory available for U.S. ethanol imports. During 2020, Brazilian annual corn harvest has seen encouraging expansion, resulting in corn-based ethanol production almost doubling since last year. Any additional increase in ethanol imports from Brazil will further increase domestic ethanol supplies in the United States and may result in ethanol price decreases.
    Based on the current strength of the United States Dollar compared to the Brazilian Reis along with very favorable prices for sugarcane based ethanol in the United States, specifically in California, it is possible that U.S. ethanol imports from Brazil could increase in Fiscal 2021 which would further impact the level of ethanol supplies in the United States and may result in ethanol price decreases. 
    Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries, including Brazil, may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the United States.
Local Ethanol Production

    Because we are located on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, and because ethanol producers generally compete primarily with local and regional producers, the ethanol producers located in Iowa and Nebraska presently constitute our primary competition.  According to the Renewable Fuels Association, 2020 Ethanol Outlook, Iowa had 43 operating ethanol refineries in production, with a combined nameplate capacity to produce 4.5 billion gallons of ethanol.  For Nebraska, the RFA reports there are currently 26 existing ethanol plants in production in Nebraska, with a combined ethanol nameplate production capacity of approximately 2.3 billion gallons. As previously discussed, in response to the COVID-19pandemic and the impact to the economy, many plants in Iowa and Nebraska have shut down production or cut production. A local competitor idled one plant in Iowa, and one in Nebraska in April of 2020, and recently announced they will continue to keep them idle through the winter.
Competition from Alternative Renewable Fuels
    Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn, including cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Research continues regarding cellulosic ethanol, and various companies are in various stages of developing and constructing some of the first generation cellulosic plants. Several companies have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and, at a few companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future, although these cellulosic ethanol plants have continued to face financial and technological issues. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
    Because our Facility is designed as a single-feedstock facility, we have limited ability to adapt the plant to a different feedstock or process system without additional capital investment and retooling.
    A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Like ethanol, the emerging fuel cell and electric-powered vehicle industries offer technological options to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. Fuel cells have emerged as a potential alternative to certain existing power sources because of their higher efficiency, reduced noise and lower emissions. Fuel cell industry participants are currently targeting the transportation, stationary power and portable power markets in order to decrease fuel costs, lessen dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. The same can be said of electric-powered vehicles. If the fuel cell industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance and becomes readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. Likewise, participants in the emerging electric-powered vehicle industry are currently targeting the transportation market to decrease dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. If the electric-powered vehicle industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance, the ethanol and larger gasoline industry may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability
.
Distillers Grain Competition
    Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. According to the RFA 2020 Ethanol Outlook (the "RFA 2020 Outlook"), ethanol plants produced almost 39.6 million metric tons of distillers grains and other animal feed in 2019.  We compete with other producers of distillers grains products both locally and nationally.
    The primary customers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle, according to the RFA 2020 Outlook, which comprises 74% of distiller grains consumption. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine, poultry and fish markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from such expansion.
    The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Distillers grains contain nutrients, fat content, and fiber that we believe will differentiate our distillers grains products from other feed formulations. However, producers of other forms of animal feed may also have greater experience and resources than we do and their products may have greater acceptance among producers of beef and dairy cattle, poultry and hogs.
Principal Supply & Demand Factors
Ethanol

    Ethanol prices fluctated wildly during Fiscal 2020 as the impact on gasoline demand caused by an economic slowdown due to the pandemic caused price of ethanol to be reduced 30% between April and June 2020. Capacity was impacted as numerous plants reduced or ceased production to adjust to the changing conditions. The industry never saw the benefit of implementing the year-round use of E15 ethanol signed in May 2019, as the economy stalled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and many local and state governments implemented stay at home orders, lockdowns and other quarantine requirements which adversely impact gasoline consumption in general. 
Management currently expects ethanol prices will continue to adjust to the supply and demand factors of ethanol and oil and will generally fluctuate with, but not be directly correlated to, the price of corn.  
Management believes the industry will need to align the retail product delivery infrastructure and demand for ethanol in order to increase production margins in the near and long term. The supply and demand in the industry remain in relative balance at current production values.
    Management also believes it is important that ethanol blending capabilities of the gasoline market be expanded to increase demand for ethanol.  Recently, there has been increased awareness of the need to expand retail ethanol distribution and blending infrastructure, which would allow the ethanol industry to supply ethanol to markets in the United States that are not currently selling significant amounts of ethanol. On June 1, 2019, President Trump initiated rulemaking to expand fuel waivers 
for E15 to allow year round sale of fuel blends containing gasoline up to a 15% blend of ethanol. Although there have been significant developments towards the availability of E15 in the marketplace and the recent EPA final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15, there are still obstacles that could inhibit meaningful market penetration by E15.
Distillers Grains
    Distillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. In North America, over 80% of distillers grains are used in ruminant animal diets, with the balance to poultry and swine.  Every bushel of corn used in the dry grind ethanol process yields approximately 17 pounds of dry matter distillers grains, which is an excellent source of energy and protein for livestock and poultry.  The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are derived. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans and corn, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.
    Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have correlated with prices of corn. However, there have been occasions when the price increase for this co-product has not been directly correlated to changes in corn prices. In addition, our distillers grains compete with products made from other feedstocks, the cost of which may not rise when corn prices rise. Consequently, the price we may receive for distillers grains may not rise as corn prices rise, thereby lowering our cost recovery percentage relative to corn.
    Management expects that distillers grain prices will continue to generally follow the price of corn during Fiscal 2021.
Competition for Supply of Corn
    During crop year 2019/20, according to the USDA October 2020 report, 81.3 million acres of corn were harvested, which was down slightly from 2018/19. Although there were more acres planted, the expected yield is 167.5 bushels per acre, which is down 5% compared to 2019's results. A contributing factor to the shortfall was a intense storm in August 2020 that impacted 550 thousand acres of corn and caused extensive property damage to grain elevators. For the crop year 2020/21, current projections are 82.5 million acres of corn to be harvested, and the yield per acre is projected to approach recent levels of 178.4 bushels per acre. Prices for corn are expected to continue to increase slightly as a result of the replacement of lower beginning stocks, higher total domestic use and increased exports as forecasted by the USDA.
    Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists around our Facility.  According to RFA 2020 Ethanol Industry Outlook, there were 43 operational ethanol plants in Iowa. The plants are concentrated, for the most part, in the northern and central regions of the state where a majority of the corn is produced. 
    We compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users. According to the USDA, for 2018/2019, 5.4 billion bushels of U.S. corn were used in ethanol production, with 6.8 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 2.1 billion bushels used for export.  For the crop year 2019/20, bushels of U.S. corn for ethanol production fell to 4.9 billion bushels used in ethanol production, with 6.3 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 1.8 billion bushels used for export. As of October 2020, the USDA has forecast the amount of corn to be used for ethanol production during the current marketing year to increase slightly to 5.1 billion bushels with 6.5 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 2.3 billion bushels used for exports.
Federal Ethanol Support and Governmental Regulations

RFS and Related Federal Legislation

    The ethanol industry receives support through the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”) which has been, and will continue to be, a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage. The RFS requires that each year a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that allows refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas of the country where it is most cost-effective. The EPA is responsible for revising and implementing regulations to ensure that transportation fuel sold in the United States contains a minimum volume of renewable fuel.  
    The RFS original statutory volume requirements increased incrementally each year through 2022 when the mandate requires that the United States use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels.  Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
    Annually, the EPA is supposed to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation. On November 30, 2018, the EPA issued the final rule that set the 2019 annual volume requirements for renewable fuel at 19.92 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year (the "Final 2019 Rule"). On July 5, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule for 2020 which set the annual volume requirements renewable fuel at 19.92 billion gallons of renewable fuel (the "Proposed 2020 Rule"). Both the Final 2019 Rule and the Proposed 2020 Rule maintained the number of gallons that may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons. A public hearing on the Proposed 2020 Rule was held in July and the public comment period expired on August 30, 2019. The final rule was originally expected to be issued in November 2019.
    However, on October 15, 2019, the EPA released a supplemental notice seeking additional comments on a proposed rule on adjustments to the way that annual renewable fuel percentages are calculated. The supplemental notice was issued in response to an announcement on October 4, 2019, by President Trump of a proposed plan to require refiners not exempt from the rules to blend additional gallons of ethanol to make up for the gallons exempted by the EPA's expanded use of waivers to small refineries. The effect of these waivers is that the refinery is no longer required to earn or purchase blending credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers or "RINs", negatively affecting ethanol demand and resulting in lower ethanol prices. The proposed plan was expected to calculate the volume that refiners were required to blend by using a three-year average of exempted gallons. However, the EPA proposed to use a three-year average to account for the reduction in demand resulting from the waivers using the number of gallons of relief recommended by the United States Department of Energy. A public hearing on the proposed rule was held October 30 and the public comment period expired on November 30, 2019. On December 19, 2019, the EPA issued the final rule that set out the 2020 annual volume requirements (the "Final 2020 Rule") at 20.09 billion gallons up from the 19.92 billion gallons for 2019. Similar to the Final 2019 Rule, the Final 2020 Rule included 15.0 billion gallons of conventional corn-based ethanol. 
The EPA has not yet released the proposed rule to set the renewable volume obligation for 2021.
    Although the volume requirements set forth in the Final 2019 Rule are slightly higher than the final 2018 volume requirements (the "Final 2018 Rule") and the Final 2020 Rule volume requirements are slightly higher than those set forth in the Final 2019 Rule, the volume requirements under the Final 2018 Rule, the Final 2019 Rule and the Final 2020 Rule are all still significantly below the statutory mandates of 26 billion gallons, 28 billion gallons and 30 billion gallons, respectively, with significant reductions in the volume requirements for advanced biofuels as well.
    Under the RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. The Final 2018 Rule represented the first year the total proposed volume requirements were more than 20% below statutory levels. In response, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The Final 2019 Rule is approximately 29% below the statutory levels representing the second consecutive year of reductions of more than 20% below the statutory mandates therefore triggering the mandatory reset under the RFS. The Final 2020 Rule is approximately 34% below the statutory targets, which represents the third consecutive year of reductions of more than 20% below the statutory mandates. After the issuance of the Final 2019 Rule, the EPA became statutorily required to modify the statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the volume requirements post-2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of agricultural commodities, food prices, and rural economic development.
    In October 2018, the Trump administration released timelines for certain EPA rulemaking initiatives relating to the RFS including the “reset” of the statutory blending targets. The EPA is expected to propose rules modifying the applicable statutory volume targets for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for the years 2020-2022. The proposed rules are also expected to include proposed diesel renewable volume obligations for 2021 and 2022. 
    Federal mandates supporting the use of renewable fuels like the RFS are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Ethanol policies are influenced by environmental concerns, diversifying our fuel supply, and an interest in reducing the country’s dependence on foreign oil. Consumer acceptance of flex-fuel vehicles and higher ethanol blends of ethanol in non-flex-fuel vehicles may be necessary before ethanol can achieve significant growth in U.S. market share. Another important factor is a waiver in the Clean Air Act, known as the "One-Pound Waiver", which allows E10 to be sold year-round, even though it exceeds the RVP ("Reid Vapor Pressure", a common measure of gasoline volatility) limitation of nine pounds per square inch. At the end of May 2019, the EPA finalized a rule which extended the One-Pound Waiver to E15 so its sale can expand beyond flex-fuel vehicles during the June 1 to September 15 summer driving season. Although this rule is being challenged in court, the One-Pound Waiver is in effect and E15 can be sold year round. However, with respect to the 2019 summer driving season, because the rule was not finalized until the end of May, the ethanol industry was unable to fully 
capitalize on increased E15 sales during the 2019 peak summer driving season. The EIA first quarter estimate, which did not take into account the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy, had gasoline consumption for 2020 flat with last year, with gasoline prices being 18% lower than in 2019. The EIA forecast for summer driving put consumption down 23% as compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of travel restrictions and reduced economic activity related to COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a significant impact on the U.S. and worldwide economy over the next few months.

    Despite the recent actions by the Trump administration relating to E15, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the RFS as a result of the significant number of small refinery waivers granted. Under the RFS, the EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total domestic transportation fuel sales. The mechanism that provides accountability in RFS compliance is the Renewable Identification Number (RIN). RIN’s are a tradeable commodity given that if refiners (obligated parties) need additional RIN’s to be compliant, they have to purchase them from those that have excess. Thus, there is an economic incentive to use renewable fuels like ethanol, or in the alternative, buy RIN’s. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by ethanol producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties.
On April 15, 2020, five Governors sent a letter to the EPA requesting a general waiver from the RFS due to the drop in demand caused by COVID-19 travel restrictions. They contend that the compliance costs (i.e. cost to purchase RINs) is onerous and could put some refineries out of business. In June 2020, the Attorneys General of seven states joined in the request made to waive the 2020 RFS compliance burdens. The EPA has 90 days to respond, and as of the date of this filing, had indicated only that they are “watching the situation closely, and reviewing the governors’ letter.”
    Although the Final 2018 Rule, the Final 2019 Rule, and the Final 2020 Rule maintain the number of gallons which may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons this number does not take into account waivers granted by the EPA to small refiners for "hardship." The EPA can, in consultation with the Department of Energy, waive the obligation for individual smaller refineries that are suffering “disproportionate economic hardship” due to compliance with the RFS. To qualify, for this “small refinery waiver,” the refineries must be under total throughput of 75,000 barrels per day and state their case for an exemption in an application to the EPA each year. 
As of June 2020, the EPA has approved 85 exemptions for compliance years 2016 to 2018, freeing refineries from using 4 billion gallons of renewable fuel. This effectively reduces the annual renewable volume obligation for each year by that amount as the waivers exempt the obligating parties from meeting the RFS blending targets and the waived gallons are not reallocated to other obligated parties at this time. As discussed above, the mechanism that provides accountability in RFS compliance is the Renewable Identification Number ("RIN"). RINs are a tradeable commodity given that if refiners (obligated parties) need additional RINs to be compliant, they have to purchase them from those that have excess. Thus, there is an economic incentive to use renewable fuels like ethanol, or in the alternative, buy RINs. Granting these small refinery waivers effectively reduces the annual renewable volume obligation for each year by that amount as the waivers exempt the obligating parties from meeting the RFS blending targets and the waived gallons are not reallocated to other obligated parties at this time. The resulting surplus of RINs in the market has brought values down significantly to under $0.20. In late 2017 D6 RIN prices were about $0.75 per gallon, averaged $0.30 in 2018, and less than $0.20 in 2019. Since higher RIN values help to make higher blends of ethanol more cost competitive, lower RIN values could hinder or at least slow retailer and consumer adoption of E15 and higher blends. As discussed further below, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that multiple small refinery exemptions were improperly extended by the EPA which caused D6 RIN trading prices to increase to approximately $0.24 per gallon in January 2020. Recently RIN values have increased to near $0.60 based on lower ethanol production levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of June 30, 2020, the EPA has received 52 requests for small refinery waivers that will be up for consideration during 2020. If the EPA approves all 52 of the pending applications, the ethanol market would suffer another loss of 2 billion gallons of biofuel blending requirements which will adversely impact RIN prices and the ethanol market. These waiver requests represent an effort by refineries to bypass the ruling of the Tenth Circuit and establish a continuous chain of exemptions. If the EPA continues to grant discretionary waivers and RIN prices continue to fall, it could negatively affect ethanol prices.
The Trump Administration has not announced a plan to reallocate ethanol gallons lost to exemptions in the current year and therefore, the continued granting of waivers and the failure of the Trump Administration to take any action to reallocate the lost exemptions will continue to negatively impact ethanol demand and RIN and ethanol prices
    Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the Final 2019 Rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rulemaking. This is the first RFS rulemaking since the 
expanded use of the exemptions came to light, however the EPA has refused to cap the number of waivers it grants or how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its percentage standard calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. The EPA's current approach runs counter to this statutory mandate and undermines Congressional intent. Biofuels groups argue the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future.
In a supplemental rulemaking to the Proposed 2020 Rule, the EPA changed their approach, and for the first time accounted for the gallons that they anticipate they will be waiving from the blending requirements due to small refinery exemptions. To accomplish this, they are adding in the trailing three year average of gallons the Department of Energy (the "DOE") recommended be waived, in effect raising the blending volumes across the board in anticipation of waiving the obligations in whole or in part for certain refineries that qualify for the exemptions. Although in past years the EPA has disregarded recommendations from the Department of Energy in the rule the DOE stated its intent to adhere to these recommendations going forward, including granting partial waivers rather than an all or nothing approach. The EPA will be adjudicating the 2020 compliance year small refinery exemption applications in early 2021, but have indicated they will adhere to DOE recommendations for the 2019 compliance year applications as well, which should be adjudicated in 2020. 
    If the EPA’s decisions to reduce the volume requirements under the RFS statutory mandates is allowed to stand, if the volume requirements are further reduced or if the EPA continues to grant waivers to small refineries, the market price and demand for ethanol would be adversely affected which would negatively impact our financial performance. The EPA based the projected volume of gasoline and diesel that was exempt in 2020 on utilizing the three year rolling average of relief recommended by the Department of Energy, rather than the three year rolling level of actual exemptions advocated by agricultural interests.
    On May 29, 2018, the National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, and the Renewable Fuels Association filed a petition challenging the EPA’s grant of waivers to three specific refineries seeking that the court reject the waivers granted to the three as an abuse of EPA authority.  These waived gallons are not redistributed to obligated parties, and in effect, reduce the aggregate Renewable Volume Obligations ("RVOs") under the RFS. If the specific waivers granted by the EPA and/or its lower criteria for granting small refinery waivers under the RFS are allowed to stand, or if the volume requirements are further reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance. On January 24, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit announced that the three exemptions were improperly issued by the EPA. The Court held that the EPA cannot "extend" exemptions to any small refineries whose earlier, temporary exemptions had lapsed. The Court concluded that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in granting these petitions because there was nothing for the agency to "extend". Utilizing this criteria, there would have been a maximum of seven small refineries that could have received continuous extensions, yet the EPA has granted thirty five exemptions in a single year. The Court also found the EPA had abused their discretion in failing to explain how the EPA could maintain that such refineries would incur an economic hardship while continuing to claim that the costs of RIN compliance are passed through and recovered by those same refineries.
On January 24, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit announced that the three exemptions were improperly issued by the EPA. The Court held that the EPA cannot "extend" exemptions to any small refineries whose earlier, temporary exemptions had lapsed; rather, that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. The Court concluded that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in granting these petitions because there was nothing for the agency to "extend". Utilizing this criteria, there would have been a maximum of seven small refineries that could have received continuous extensions, yet the EPA has granted thirty five exemptions in a single year. The Court also found the EPA had abused their discretion in failing to explain how the EPA could maintain that such refineries would incur an economic hardship while continuing to claim that the costs of RIN compliance are passed through and recovered by those same refineries. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years. There are currently still some petitions for waivers pending before the EPA for 2019 and 2020 compliance years    
Related to the recent lawsuits, the Renewable Fuels Association, American Coalition for Ethanol, Growth Energy, National Biodiesel Board, National Corn Growers Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, and National Farmers Union petitioned the EPA on June 4, 2018 to change its regulations to account for lost volumes of renewable fuel resulting from the retroactive small refinery exemptions. This petition to the EPA seeks a broader, forward-looking remedy to account for the collective lost volumes caused by the recent increase in retroactive small refinery RVO exemptions. The EPA has not reallocated volume exemptions in prior years, and continued to approve 31 new requests in 2019. On October 29, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce met to examine the effects of the small refinery 
exemptions on biofuels and agriculture since 2016. Several companies have petitioned the EPA to make available more information on refinery exemptions.
    On February 4, 2019, Growth Energy filed a lawsuit in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against the EPA challenging the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the Final 2019 Rule. An administrative stay has been granted to research the contents of the lawsuit.
    Although the maintenance of the 15 billion gallon threshold for volume requirements that may be met with corn-based ethanol in the Final 2019 Rule and the Final 2020 Rule together with the application of the One-Pound Waiver to E15 permitting the year round sale of E15 signals support from the EPA and the Trump administration for domestic ethanol production, the Trump administration could still elect to materially modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate the RFS and it is unclear what regulatory framework and renewable volume requirements, if any, will emerge as a result of any such reforms; however, any such reform could adversely affect the demand and price for ethanol and the Company's profitability.
On September 24, 2020, Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois introduced the Next Generation Fuels Act, which establishes a minimum octane standard for gasoline and requires sources of added octane value to reduce carbon emissions by at least 30% when compared to baseline gasoline. The legislation would require the EPA to create a 98 research octane number ("RON") standard, limit reliance on toxic aromatic hydrocarbons, and update fuel and infrastructure regulations to expand the availability of mid-level ethanol blends. The bill would ensure parity in the regulation of gasoline volatility, correct the R-factor used in fuel economy testing, provide for an E30 fuel waiver, replace the EPS's flawed MOVES model, and restore meaningful credit toward compliance with fuel economy and emission standards for the production of flex field vehicles. Another provision is to enable the sale of E15 fuel using E10 pumps, subject to state regulations.
On October 28, 2020, Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, after the failure of the EPA to respond to several Freedom of Information Act requests regarding the small refinery exemption ("SRE") program and the escalation by the EPA of the granting SRE's in the past three years, filed a partial summary judgement in the District Court of the District of Columbia. The petition asserts that EPA's granting of SREs has allowed numerous refineries to avoid their RFS compliance obligations at the expense of renewable fuel producers and supporters, including American farmers. The two organizations have asked the court to order the following: 1) the EPA should not withhold the name of the company submitting the application or the name and location of the refinery for which relief is sought; 2) the EPA should immediately produce the information withheld for the Renewable Fuel Standard compliance years 2015 through 2017; and 3) the EPA should not withhold any of the five data elements identified in the Renewables Enhancement and Growth Support ("REGS") rule. 
COVID-19 Legislation
    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") in late March 2020 in an attempt to offset the subsequent economic damage. The CARES Act created and funded multiple programs that have impacted or could impact our industry. The United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") was given additional resources for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and they are using those funds to provide direct payments to farmers, including corn farmers from whom we purchase most of our feedstock for ethanol production. Similar to the trade aid payments made by the USDA over the past two years, this cash injection for farmers could cause them to delay marketing decisions and increase the price we have to pay to purchase the corn. The USDA did not include any CCC funds for ethanol plants as of this filing.
    The CARES Act also provided for the Small Business Administration (the "SBA") to assist companies that constitute small business and keep them from laying off workers. The Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP") was created and quickly paid out all of the funds appropriated, including some to farmers and to ethanol plants. Although we received our PPP Loan under the CARES Act, as discussed above, the receipt of PPP funds by farmers could, like the CCC funds, incentivize them to delay marketing corn which could increase the price of corn.
    Ethanol is the primary ingredient in hand sanitizer. The CARES Act provided a tax exclusion on the shipment of undenatured ethanol for use in manufacturing hand sanitizer. The FDA has provided expanded guidance to allow for more denaturants to be used in ethanol intended for hand sanitizer production, and has expanded the grades of ethanol allowed for the duration of the public health crisis. In June 2020, the FDA tightened the temporary regulatory language such that certain ethanol plants, including the Company, halted production and cancelled supply agreements for ethanol used in hand sanitizer.
There is potential for financial relief to the biofuel sector in the next government spending program. On October 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed another COVID-19 economic relief package, the HEROES Act II, which provides for $2.2 billion in relief and includes provisions for the renewable fuels industry. U.S. Senate confirmation is 
required, but as of the date of this filing, the U.S. Senate has not passed the HEROES Act II. If the HEROES Act II were to become law, it could provide a 45 cent per gallon payment for qualified fuel produced from January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The Company received $0.7 million from the State of Iowa in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, from an allocation given to individual states via the first government spending program. This was classified as other operating income. There is no guarantee that the HEROES Act II will be enacted or if enacted, will include any provisions for the benefit of the renewable fuels industry or that if included, we would receive any such benefits.
State Initiatives and Mandates

    In 2006, Iowa passed legislation promoting the use of renewable fuels in Iowa.  One of the most significant provisions of the Iowa renewable fuels legislation was a renewable fuels targeted set of tax credits encouraging an escalating percentage of the gasoline sold in Iowa to consist of, be blended with, or be replaced by, renewable fuels. To receive the tax credit, retailers of gasoline are required to reach escalating annual targets of the percentage of their gasoline sales that consist of, are blended with, or are replaced by, renewable fuels.  This renewable fuel tax credit originally required 10% of the gasoline that retailers sold to fall within the renewable fuels definitions to receive the credit and has increased incrementally to 25% as of January 1, 2020. This tax credit will automatically sunset for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021 unless legislative action is taken. 
E85

    Demand for ethanol has been affected by moderately increased consumption of E85 fuel, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, which is available for use in flex fuel vehicles.  There are more than 21 million flex fuel vehicles on the road today, or approximately 8% of all vehicles, representing more vehicles than require premium gasoline today.  In addition to use as a fuel in flexible fuel vehicles, E85 can be used as an aviation fuel, as reported by the National Corn Growers Association, and as a hydrogen source for fuel cells. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, there are currently more than 21 million flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on E85 in the United States and nearly all of the major automakers have available flexible fuel modes and have indicated plans to produce several million more flexible fuel vehicles per year.  The U.S. Department of Energy reports that there are more than 3,500 retail gasoline stations supplying E85 or other ethanol flex fuel blends.  While the number of retail E85 suppliers has increased each year, this remains a relatively small percentage of the total number of U.S. retail gasoline stations, which is approximately 168,000.  In order for E85 fuel to increase demand for ethanol, it must be available for consumers to purchase it.  As public awareness of ethanol and E85 increases along with E85’s increased availability, management anticipates some growth in demand for ethanol associated with increased E85 consumption. The USDA provides financial assistance to help implement “blender pumps” in the United States in order to increase demand for ethanol and to help offset the cost of introducing mid-level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. 
    Changes in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards have also benefited the ethanol industry by encouraging use of E85 fuel products. CAFE provides an effective 54% efficiency bonus to flexible-fuel vehicles running on E85. This variance encourages auto manufacturers to build more flexible-fuel models, particularly in trucks and sport utility vehicles that are otherwise unlikely to meet CAFE standards.
E15

    E15 is a blend of higher octane gasoline and up to 15% ethanol.  E15 was approved for use in model year 2001 and newer cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles (SUVs) and all flex-fuel vehicles by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2012, This approved group of vehicles includes 90% of the cars, trucks and SUVs on the road today According to the Renewable Fuel Association. This higher octane fuel is available in 30 states at retail fueling stations. Sheetz, Kum & Go, Murphy USA, MAPCO Express, Protec Fuel, Minnoco, Thornton's, Hy-Vee, Growmark and Casey's all offer E15 to 2001 and newer vehicles today at several stations. One of the historic challenges with the growth of the E15 market is the fact that, the waiver in the Clean Air Act, known as the One-Pound Waiver, which allows E10 to be sold year-round, does not apply to E15 or higher blends, even though it has similar physical properties to E10. On March 12, 2019, the EPA proposed regulatory changes to allow E15 to take advantage of the One-Pound Waiver and authorized the sale of E15 during the summer 
months even though it exceeds the Reid Vapor Pressure limitation. At the end of May 2019, the EPA finalized the rule extending the One-Pound Waiver to E15 so its sale can expand beyond flex-fuel vehicles during the June 1 to September 15 summer driving season. This rule is being challenged in an action filed in Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit.
    In May 2020, the USDA announced the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program which consists of up to $100 million in funding for grants to be use to increase the availability of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel fuels and to help increase the implementation of “blender pumps” in the United States. Funds may be awarded to retailers such as fueling stations and convenience stores to assist in the cost of installation or upgrading of fuel pumps and other infrastructure which helps offset the cost of introducing higher level ethanol blends into the United States retail gasoline market. A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E15, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. In October 2020, the USDA announced the grant of $22 million of awards to the first round of recipients. 
The program's predecessory, the Biofuels Infrastructure Partnership ("BIP"), was implemented by the USDA in May 2015 to increase the availability of higher blends and to fund the installation of new ethanol infrastructure. The USDA reports that to date, 20 states have received BIP federal funding in an aggregate amount of $100 million covering nearly 1,500 stations with almost 5,000 proposed pumps.
Cellulosic Ethanol

    The Energy Independence and Security Act provided numerous funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol. In addition, RFS2 mandates an increasing level of production of biofuels which are not derived from corn. These policies suggest an increasing policy preference away from corn ethanol and toward cellulosic ethanol. 
Environmental and Other Regulations and Permits
    Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate matters, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide.  Ethanol production also requires the use of significant volumes of water, a portion of which is treated and discharged into the environment.  We are required to maintain various environmental and operating permits.  Even though we have successfully acquired the permits necessary for our operations, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such regulations.  In addition, if we sought to expand the Facility’s capacity in the future, above our current 140 million gallons, we would likely be required to acquire additional regulatory permits and could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment.   Our failure to obtain and maintain any environmental and/or operating permits currently required or which may be required in the future could force us to make material changes to our Facility or to shut down altogether.  
    The U.S. Supreme Court has classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. As stated above, we believe the final RFS2 regulations grandfather our plant at its current operating capacity, though expansion of our plant will need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to expand capacity at our plant above our current permitted 140 million gallons, we will be required to obtain additional permits and install improved technology.
    Separately, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (the "LCFS") requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 2020 using a lifecycle GHG emissions calculation. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. CARB appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on the overall market demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices. 
    Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Other examples of government policies that can have an impact on our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos.
    We also employ maintenance and operations personnel at our Facility. In addition to the attention that we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations at our Facility are governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.
    We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
