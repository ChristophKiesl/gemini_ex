Item 1. Business.
General

Texas Pacific Land Trust (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “Texas Pacific”, the “Trust”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 900,000 acres of land in West Texas. Texas Pacific was organized under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, and to issue transferable Certificates of Proprietary Interest pro rata to the holders of certain debt securities of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. Our Trustees are empowered under the Declaration of Trust to manage the lands with all the powers of an absolute owner.
Our surface and royalty ownership allow steady revenue generation through the entire value chain of oil and gas development. While we are not an oil and gas producer, we benefit from various revenue sources throughout the life cycle of a well. During the initial development phase where infrastructure for oil and gas development is constructed, we receive fixed fee payments for use of our land and revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of the infrastructure. During the drilling and completion phase, we generate revenue for providing sourced water and/or treated produced water in addition to fixed fee payments for use of our land. During the production phase, we receive revenue from our oil and gas royalty interests and also revenues related to saltwater disposal on our land. In addition, we generate revenue from a variety of land uses including midstream infrastructure projects and processing facilities as hydrocarbons are processed and transported to market. 
Conversion Exploration Committee
On July 30, 2019, the Trust and Trustees John R. Norris III and David E. Barry entered into a settlement
agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, Murray Stahl,
SoftVest, L.P., SoftVest Advisors, LLC, Eric L. Oliver, ART-FGT Family Partners Limited, Tessler Family Limited Partnership and Allan R. Tessler (the “Investor Group”) with respect to the previous proxy contest mounted by the Investor Group and the then pending litigation between the parties. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, (i) to dismiss the pending litigation captioned Case 3:19-cv-01224-B Texas Pacific Land Trust et al v. Oliver in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas, (ii) that the third Trustee position would remain vacant at least until the end of the Restricted Period (as defined in the Settlement Agreement), (iii) to add three new members, including Mr. Stahl and Mr. Oliver, to the Conversion Exploration Committee (the “Committee”), which was formed in June, 2019 to evaluate the conversion of the Trust into a C-corporation (the “Conversion”), (iv) the Committee would continue to be governed by its charter dated June 23, 2019, as amended and restated on July 30, 2019, and would complete its work by December 31, 2019, unless the Committee otherwise determined, (v) if the Committee recommends a plan of Conversion and proposes the approval of the Trust’s sub-shareholders, the Investor Group would be required to (1) vote all of the Sub-share Certificates of Proprietary Interest (“Sub-shares”) beneficially owned by it in favor of such Conversion at a special meeting called therefor by the Trustees, and (2) privately and publicly support such Conversion through a press release as an exempt solicitation, (vi) if the Trustees decide, within 30 days of recommendation (the “Decision Period”) to implement such plan of Conversion in the form recommended by the Committee in all material respects, (1) the Investor Group would be prohibited from challenging such Conversion in court or otherwise prior to the end of the Restricted Period, and (2) the parties would grant 
mutual general releases in one another’s favor upon completion of such Conversion, and (vii) to abide by other customary terms of settlement. 
The Committee met on a regular basis throughout the remainder of 2019 and into January 2020 to consult with the Trust's advisors regarding steps to effectuate the Trust's conversion or reorganization to a corporate structure. 
On January 22, 2020, the Committee announced that, following a deliberation process initiated in June 2019, the Committee recommended to the Trustees that the Trust convert from a trust into a Delaware C-corporation. The Committee analyzed reasons for and alternatives to conversion with support from a team of advisors to the Trust, including financial advisor Credit Suisse and outside legal counsel. The Committee’s deliberations focused particularly on tax, corporate, corporate governance, accounting and business implications of the proposed conversion.
On February 20, 2020, the Trust and the Investor Group entered into the First Amendment to Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement Amendment”). The Settlement Agreement Amendment provides that the Decision Period will extend through March 6, 2020.
The decision of whether to convert the Trust into a C-corporation is subject to the determination of the Trustees. The Committee recommended that, if the Trustees elect to authorize the conversion, the conversion should follow a process intended to ensure a smooth transition that would be tax-free to shareholders. As proposed, the Trust would transfer all its assets, including cash, land, Texas Pacific Water Resources (“TPWR”), and other assets, to a wholly-owned limited liability company subsidiary of the Trust (“TPL Holdco”). The Trust would then contribute all of the equity in TPL Holdco, holding all of the Trust’s assets, to a newly-created corporation (“TPL Corporation”). Shareholders of the Trust would receive an amount of shares in TPL Corporation proportional to their ownership of shares in the Trust. When this process as recommended is completed, shares of the Trust would be cancelled. Shareholders of the Trust would not need to take any action to receive the new shares in TPL Corporation.
The process recommended by the Committee would require filings with the SEC and approval of the listing of the new shares by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”).
Business Segments

We operate our business in two segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of the Trust and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Land and Resource Management

Our Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing the approximately 900,000 acres of land and related resources in West Texas owned by the Trust. The revenue streams of this segment principally consist of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements and commercial leases, and land and material sales. 

We are not an oil and gas producer. Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests. Thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells.

Our revenue from easements is generated from easement contracts covering activities such as oil and gas pipelines and subsurface wellbore easements. The majority of our easements have a thirty-plus year term but subsequently renew every ten years with an additional payment. We also enter into agreements with operators and mid-stream companies to lease land from us, primarily for facilities and roads. 

The demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for commercial uses prevalent in western Texas.
Operations

Revenues from the Land and Resource Management segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in millions): 

 | Years Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | |

 (1) On September 14, 2017, we settled the previously disclosed arbitration case with Chevron U.S.A., Inc. involving claims for underpayment of royalties. The Trust received $7.7 million as part of the settlement, including royalties that will be paid to the Trust on additional wells under several community leases. The settlement is included in oil and gas royalties for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Land Activity
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold approximately 21,986 acres for an aggregate sales price of approximately $113.0 million, an average price of approximately $5,141 per acre. Land sales for 2019 include a $100 million land sale for approximately 14,000 surface acres in Loving and Reeves Counties. The sale excluded any mineral or royalty interest in the lands conveyed. Additionally, the Trust conveyed approximately 5,620 acres of land in exchange for approximately 5,545 acres of land, all in Culberson County. As we had no cost basis in the land conveyed, we recognized land sales revenue of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trust acquired approximately 21,671 acres (Culberson, Glasscock, Loving and Reeves Counties) of land in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $74.4 million, an average of approximately $3,434 per acre (excludes land acquired through the land exchange as previously discussed).
Competition

Our Land and Resource Management segment does not have peers, as such, in that it sells, leases and generally manages land owned by the Trust and, to that extent, any owner of property located in areas comparable to the Trust is a potential competitor.
Water Services and Operations 

Our Water Services and Operations segment encompasses the business of providing full-service water offerings to
operators in the Permian Basin through our wholly owned subsidiary, TPWR, a single member LLC. Our significant surface ownership in West Texas provides TPWR with a unique opportunity to provide multiple full-service water offerings to operators. 
 These full-service water offerings include, but are not limited to, water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment, infrastructure development, disposal solutions, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. TPWR is committed to sustainable water development with significant focus on the large-scale implementation of recycled water operations. 
Currently, the revenue streams of this segment principally consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenue from produced water royalties. Prior to the formation of TPWR, we entered into agreements with energy companies and oilfield service businesses to allow such companies to explore for water, drill water wells, construct 
water-related infrastructure and purchase water sourced from land that we own. Energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while service businesses (i.e., water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses. While we continue to collect water royalties under these legacy agreements, the overall contribution to revenue from these legacy agreements has declined in the recent years and is expected to continue to decline in the future. 
Operations

Revenues from our Water Services and Operations segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in millions):

 | Years Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | 
 | 2019 | | | | 2018 | | | | 2017 | | 
 | Segment Revenue | | % of TotalConsolidatedRevenue | | Segment Revenue | | % of TotalConsolidatedRevenue | | SegmentRevenue | | % of TotalConsolidatedRevenue
Water sales and royalties | $ | 85.0 | | | 17 | % | | $ | 63.9 | | | 21 | % | $ | 25.5 | | 16 | %
Easements and other surface-related income | 42.2 | | | 9 | % | | 24.8 | | | 9 | % | | 5.8 | | 4 | %
Total Revenue – Water Services and Operations segment | $ | 127.2 | | | 26 | % | | $ | 88.7 | | | 30 | % | $ | 31.3 | | 20 | %


Our first sales from internally developed projects were made during the fourth quarter of 2017. The number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 44.0% over the same period in 2018. 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trust invested approximately $30.2 million in TPWR projects to develop and enhance water sourcing and water treatment assets with $21.0 million of this occurring during the first six months of 2019.
Competition

While there is competition in the water service business in West Texas, we believe our position as a significant landowner of approximately 900,000 acres in West Texas gives us a unique advantage over our competitors who must negotiate with existing landowners to source water and then for the right of way to deliver the water to the end user.
Major Customers 

During 2019, we received $112.7 million, or approximately 23% of our total revenues (prior to deferrals), which included $100.0 million of land sales and $11.3 million of oil and gas royalties from WPX Energy Permian, LLC and $67.8 million, or approximately 14% of our total revenues (prior to deferrals), which included $33.7 million of oil and gas royalties, $24.5 million of easements and other surface-related income (prior to deferrals) and $9.6 million of water sales and royalties from Anadarko E&P Onshore, LLC.
Seasonality

The business of Texas Pacific is not seasonal in nature, as that term is generally understood, although due to the nature of our operations, our revenue may vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter.
Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws. Management believes that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive effect on our method of operations than on other companies similar to the Trust.

We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.

Environmental Considerations

Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had no material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of Texas Pacific. To date, Texas Pacific has not been called upon to expend any funds for these purposes.
Employees

As of December 31, 2019, Texas Pacific had 94 full-time employees.
