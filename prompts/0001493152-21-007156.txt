ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc. (“Intellinetics”), is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with two wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Intellinetics Ohio”) and (ii) Graphic Sciences, Inc., a Michigan corporation (“Graphic Sciences,” together with Intellinetics Ohio and Intellinetics, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. On March 2, 2020, Intellinetics purchased Graphic Sciences, Inc.
 
The Company is a document services and solutions software company serving both the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors. Company products and services are provided through two reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. The Company’s Document Management segment consists primarily of solutions involving our software platform, which allows customers to capture and manage all documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and all digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. The Company’s Document Conversion offerings provide assistance to clients as a part of their overall document strategy to convert documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, including migration to our software solutions, as well as long-term storage and retrieval services. The Company’s solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the people who need them by making them easy to find, while also being secure and compliant with the customers’ audit requirements.
 
Customers obtain use of the Company’s software by either purchasing it for installation onto their equipment, referred to as a “premise” model, or by accessing the platform via the Internet, referred to as a “cloud-based,” “software as a service,” or “SaaS” model. The Company continues to see increases in its provision of SaaS-based customer activation, and this migration by clients is the most significant strategic part of its revenue growth opportunity. Our SaaS products are hosted with Amazon Web Services, Expedient, and Skynet Managed Technology Services, offering our customers reliable hosting services with best practices in data security.
 
Software and Services
 
Document Management
 
The Company’s flagship software platform is IntelliCloudTM, reflecting the Company and market focus on growth via cloud-based managed document service delivery. Our Document Management business also provides software-related professional services that include installation, integration, training, and consulting services, as well as ongoing software maintenance and customer support.
 
The four primary components of the IntelliCloudTM solution are as follows:
 

● | Image Processing: includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents, including support of distributed and high-volume capture, optical character recognition; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Records Management: addresses needs relating to retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for our clients; 
● | Workflow: supports business processes, routing content electronically, assigning work tasks and states (e.g., reviews or approvals, including incident case management), and creating related audit trails; 
● | Extended Components: includes document composition and e-forms (via third party OEM integration partnership), search, content and web analytics (via third party data visualization and advanced OCR engine partnerships), email and information archiving, packaged application integration, and advanced capture for invoice processing. 

Document Conversion
 
The Company converts images from paper to digital, paper to microfilm, and microfiche to microfilm for business and federal, county, and municipal governments. Our Document Conversion business also provides its clients with long-term paper and microfilm storage and retrieval options.
 
The four Document Conversion offerings are:
 

● | Digital Scanning Services. These services include paper scanning, newspaper and microfilm scanning, microfiche scanning, aperture card scanning, drawing scanning, and book scanning. Most government files must be retained for a long term or permanently, making such clients a prime candidate for digital conversion. There are four production categories for these services, consisting of document prep, scanning, indexing, and delivery. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Microfilm and Microfiche. We provide microfilming/microfiche, converting scanned images to microfilm or microfiche, and microfilm/microfiche preservation and duplication. 
● | Box Storage Services. We provide physical document storage and retrieval services for our clients. 
● | Scanning Equipment, Software and Repair. We sell and service document image software, document scanners, and microfilm scanners, readers and printers. This is a smaller, slowly declining part of our Document Conversion business.

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has a multi-channel sales model that directs our sales efforts toward both sales through direct sales and through intermediaries, such as software developers and resellers and multi-function device resellers. Our Document Management and Document Conversion segments each use direct and resellers channels for sales. We have developed marketing programs with resellers and distributors (collectively, “Resellers”) that facilitate their selling and support of our software solutions. We believe that our Reseller strategy improvements have increased the competitive strength of our platform of products. In addition, we have established a set of business solutions templates for specific vertical markets that provide base software configurations which we believe will facilitate our delivery and installation of software to our customers in both our direct and Reseller channels. We believe that these advancements, in the aggregate, will allow us to license and sell our products to a targeted customer base, shortening our sales cycle, making margins more consistent, and allowing us to expand our sales through existing and new Reseller partnerships and direct customers. We continue to devote significant efforts, in both development and marketing, in enhancing all channels to market.
Competition and Market Position
 
The market for our products is competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the document solutions markets evolve and potentially consolidate. We believe that the trend toward electronic document management, and particularly cloud solutions, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We believe the primary competitors of our Document Management segment are DocuWare, Square 9, M-files, On-Base, and Laserfiche, who also serve small-to-medium business (SMB) and governmental sectors. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our document conversion services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.


We believe the competitors of our Document Conversion segment vary from small, niche entities
to larger entities, including Iron Mountain. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and services reputation and (ii) services quality, performance and price. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer, and that, for our current and prospective customers, maintaining secure control over the customers’ information is highly valued.
 
We believe that the consolidated Company has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium business market, and particularly organizations in highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets, such as state and local government, non-clinical health care, and K-12 education. In our view, the Company will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that the Company will benefit from five specific advantages already in place:
 

● | Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow and document conversion solutions targeting specific industry customers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Rigorous quality review process and maintenance of customer data confidentiality in document conversions; 
● | Modular solution packaging and rapid customer activation model; 
● | Integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and 
● | Proprietary AuditShieldTM compliance management module as a standard platform feature providing customers with a simple way to know if documents required by law or policy are missing. 

 
We believe, with these competitive strengths, that the Company is well positioned as a cloud-based managed document services provider for the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors.
 
Customers
 
Document Management
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 6% and 4%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, government contracts represented approximately 37% of the Document Management segment’s net revenues, including a significant portion of the segment’s sales to Resellers which represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically 12 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration.
 
Document Conversion
 
Our Document Conversion segment has significant customer concentration with the State of Michigan. Graphic Sciences’ contract is for five years from June 1, 2018 to May 30, 2023 with a provision for two, one-year extensions. The contract is issued to Graphic Sciences through the Michigan Department of Management and Budget, Enterprise Procurement and managed through the Department of Management and Budget, Records Management Services Division (RMS).
 
The contract provides local and state government agencies access to digital and micrographic conversion services. These agencies have the option to perform these conversion services internally or go out to bid if they so choose. Typically, they elect to have these services outsourced to Graphic Sciences through RMS, which eliminates the bidding process.
 
All agencies and departments are able to use the services and prices provided under this contract. Mechanically, the work we perform is invoiced to RMS and the end user is invoiced through the State of Michigan accounting system. We do not invoice the end user directly when entities utilize this contract facility, and we have a single point of contact for managing billing and receipt. The state in effect acts as a reseller of our services to the other agencies and makes a mark-up of what is charged. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the State of Michigan represented approximately 71% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 47% of the total Intellinetics revenues.

Intellectual Property
 
Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.
 
While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.
Software Development
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products.
 
In accordance with ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,” we expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented in this report.
 
In accordance with ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” the Company capitalizes purchase and implementation costs of internal use software. No such costs were capitalized during the periods presented in this report.

Human Capital
 
As of March 26, 2021, we employed a total of 98 individuals; all but 9 are full-time employees. Graphic Sciences employs 79 individuals, comprised of 72 full-time and 7 part-time employees, all located in Michigan. Graphic Sciences also utilizes temporary employees, through various agencies, to provide labor for variable project work. Intellinetics Ohio employs 19 individuals, comprised of 17 full-time and 2 part-time employees, primarily located in Ohio. As a combined company, 14 of our employees work in administration and management, 17 of our employees work in software sales, maintenance and support, and software development, and 67 of our employees work in document services and storage operations.


We consider the integrity, experience, dedication, creativity, and team-oriented nature of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and a key to our future prospects. Personal relationships with our existing customers are an important part of our business, and our customers have come to rely on the personal service and knowledge of our workforce across all functional areas. To attract and retain qualified applicants to our company and retain our employees, we offer total benefits packages consisting of base salary or hourly wage (depending on position), a comprehensive benefits package, and equity compensation for certain employees. Annual cash bonuses are based on profitability of the Company, achievement of targets and level of responsibility. When selecting talent, we consider education, experience, diversity, and the likelihood that a candidate will espouse our values of integrity, collaboration, dedication, creativity, and superior customer service.
 
The Company is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce that attracts and retains exceptional talent. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We support employee growth and development in a variety of ways including with training opportunities and an overall strategy of promotion from within. Our management conducts annual employee engagement surveys and annual individual employee assessments with an emphasis on individual development for each employee.

We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees with respect to COVID-19. In April of 2020, we instituted safe distancing practices and additional cleaning procedures for all company offices and facilities, and our offices in Michigan and Ohio were reconfigured to maintain physical distancing. Wherever feasible, we have encouraged employees to work from home. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations.
 
We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we do not have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. In addition, as of March 26, 2021, the Company engaged two independent contractors.

INTELLINETICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 

1. | Business Organization and Nature of Operations 
---+---------------------------------------------------

 
Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc., (“Intellinetics”), is a Nevada corporation incorporated in 1997, with two subsidiaries: (i) Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation that is wholly-owned by the Company (“Intellinetics Ohio), and (ii) Graphic Sciences, Inc., a Michigan corporation that is also wholly-owned by the Company (“Graphic Sciences”). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of the Company as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. On March 2, 2020, the Company purchased all the outstanding capital stock of Graphic Sciences.
 
The Company is a document management company, providing comprehensive document solutions, software, and services to its customers in both the public and private sectors. The Company’s software platform allows customers to capture and manage all documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and all digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. The Company’s suite of document services includes indexing, conversion, and physical document storage and retrieval. The Company’s comprehensive solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the processes they drive by making them easy to find, secure and compliant with its customers’ audit requirements.
 

2. | Basis of Presentation 
---+--------------------------

 
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of this Form 10-K.
 

3. | Liquidity and Management’s Plans 
---+-------------------------------------

 
Through December 31, 2020, the Company had incurred an accumulated deficit since its inception of $22,996,267, including operating losses and operating cash flow deficits in recent years. Since inception, the Company’s operations have primarily been funded through a combination of gross profits, government-sponsored loans, and the sale of both equity and debt securities. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance of $1,907,882.
 
On March 2, 2020, the Company issued shares and debt totaling $5.5 million, and converted approximately $6 million in existing debt principal and interest to equity. This resulted in a recapitalization of the balance sheet and new debt of $2 million, reducing the Company’s interest burden. Simultaneously, the Company used the proceeds from the capital raise to purchase Graphic Sciences, Inc. On April 21, 2020, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of CEO Imaging Systems, Inc. The acquisitions significantly helped the Company reach its current monthly cash flow. Further, the Company received a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) in April 2020 amounting to $838,700, and received notice on January 20, 2021 that its forgiveness application was accepted by the Small Business Administration. With improved operating results over the course of the latter half of 2020, the consolidated Company has significantly better liquidity than in prior years.
 

F-7
---


Our ability to meet our capital needs in the future will depend on many factors, including maintaining and enhancing our operating cash flow, successfully managing the transition of our recent acquisitions of Graphic Sciences and CEO Image, successfully retaining and growing our client base in the midst of general economic uncertainty, and managing the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We will need to successfully manage our revenues to support potential future earnout commitments for previous transactions and current debt service commitments, and our future cash resources and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned. Our ability to obtain additional capital or debt financing on favorable terms, if needed, would likely be adversely affected by our history of operating losses. Prior to 2020, management has historically assessed that there was substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt over the Company’s ability to meet all of its obligations over the twelve months following the date of this Report. However, management has evaluated these conditions and believes, based on its improved balance sheet, improved consolidated cash flow, and current plans and expectations, that it will be able to meet those obligations, although there is no assurance.
 
Based on our plans and assumptions as of the date of this report, we believe our capital resources, including our cash and cash equivalents, along with funds expected to be generated from our operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including for working capital, earnout liability payments for previous transactions, capital spending, and debt service commitments, for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as our history of operating losses, the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general overall economic conditions.
 

4. | Corporate Actions 
---+----------------------

 
On March 20, 2020, the Company effected a one-for-fifty (1-for-50) reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. All share and per share amounts herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
 

5. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
---+-----------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intellinetics and the accounts of all the subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held by the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. The Company’s subsidiaries include: Intellinetics Ohio and Graphic Sciences. The Company considers the criteria established under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidations” in its consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts.
 
Significant estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances related to receivables, accounts receivable -unbilled, allowance for obsolescence or slow-moving parts and supplies inventory, the recoverability of long-term assets, depreciable lives of property and equipment, purchase price allocations for acquisitions including earnout liabilities, fair value for goodwill and intangibles, the lease liabilities, estimates of fair value deferred taxes and related valuation allowances. The Company’s management monitors these risks and assesses its business and financial risks on a quarterly basis.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
In accordance with ASC 606, the Company follows a five-step model to assess each contract of a sale or service to a customer: identify the legally binding contract, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and determine whether revenue will be recognized at a point in time or over time. Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. In addition, ASC 606 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
 
We categorize revenue as software, software as a service, software maintenance services, professional services, and storage and retrieval services. We earn the majority of our revenue from the sale of professional services, followed by the sale of software maintenance services and software as a service. Specific revenue recognition policies apply to each category of revenue.
 
a) Sale of software
 
Revenues included in this classification typically include sales of licenses with professional services to new customers, additional software licenses to existing customers, and sales of software with or without services to the Company’s resellers (See section j) - Reseller Agreements, below. Our software licenses are functional intellectual property and typically provide customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity as it exists when made available to the customer. We recognize revenue from software licenses at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
b) Sale of software as a service
 
Sale of software as a service (“SaaS”) consists of revenues from arrangements that provide customers the use of the Company’s software applications, as a service, typically billed on a monthly or annual basis. Advance billings of these services are not recorded to the extent that the term of the arrangement has not commenced and payment has not been received. Revenue on these services is recognized over the contract period.
 

F-8
---


c) Sale of software maintenance services
 
Software maintenance services revenues consist of revenues derived from arrangements that provide post-contract support (“PCS”), including software support and bug fixes, to the Company’s software license holders. Advance billings of PCS are not recorded to the extent that the term of the PCS has not commenced and payment has not been received. PCS are considered distinct services. However, these distinct services are considered a single performance obligation consisting of a series of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These revenues are recognized over the term of the maintenance contract.
 
d) Sale of professional services
 
Professional services revenues consist of revenues from document scanning and conversion services, consulting, discovery, training, and advisory services to assist customers with document management needs, as well as repair and maintenance services for customer equipment. We recognize professional services revenue over time as the services are delivered using an input or output method (e.g., labor hours incurred as a percentage of total labor hours budgeted, images scanned, or similar milestones), as appropriate for the contract, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 
e) Sale of storage and retrieval services
 
Sale of document storage and retrieval services consist principally of secured warehouse storage of customer documents, which are typically retained for many years, as well as retrieval per agreement terms and certified destruction if desired. We recognize revenue from document storage and retrieval services over the term of the contract for storage and for the retrieval and destructions components, as the services are delivered. Customers are generally billed monthly based upon contractually agreed-upon terms.
 
f) Arrangements with multiple performance obligations
 
In addition to selling software licenses, software as a service, software maintenance services, professional services, and storage and retrieval services on a stand-alone basis, a portion of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation, on a relative basis using its standalone selling price. The Company determines the standalone selling price based on the price charged for the deliverable when sold separately.
 
g) Contract balances
 
When the timing of our delivery of goods or services is different from the timing of payments made by customers, we recognize either a contract asset (performance precedes contractual due date) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Customers that prepay are represented by deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract assets represent arrangements in which the good or service has been delivered but payment is not yet due. Our contract assets consisted of accounts receivable, unbilled, which are disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets. Our contract liabilities consisted of deferred (unearned) revenue, which is generally related to software as a service or software maintenance contracts. We classify deferred revenue as current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue, which are disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table presents changes in our contract assets and liabilities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019:
 

 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Addition from acquisition (Note 6) | | | Revenue Recognized in Advance of Billings | | Billings | Balance at End of Period | 
---------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+---+---------+-----------------------------------------------+---+----------+-------------------------------+---------
Twelve months ended December 31, 2020 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract assets: Accounts receivable, unbilled | $ | 23,371 | | $ | 276,023 | | $ | 917,361 | $ | (693,233 | ) | $ | 523,522
Twelve months ended December 31, 2019 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract assets: Accounts receivable, unbilled | $ | 65,118 | | $ | - | | $ | 156,876 | $ | (198,623 | ) | $ | 23,371 

 
h) Deferred revenue
 
Amounts that have been invoiced are recognized in accounts receivable, deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed for which revenue has not yet be recognized. Deferred revenues typically relate to maintenance and software-as-a-service agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services, and payments received for professional services and license arrangements and software-as-a-service performance obligations that have been deferred until fulfilled under our revenue recognition policy.
 
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price from contracts for which work has not been performed or goods and services have not been delivered. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 95% of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for software as a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was $45,323. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for software as a service and software maintenance contracts with a duration greater than one year was $69,381. This does not include revenue related to performance obligations that are part of a contract whose original expected duration is one year or less.
 

 | Balance at Beginning of Period | | Addition from acquisition (Note 6) | | | Billings | | Recognized Revenue | Balance at End of Period | 
-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+---+---------+----------+---+------------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------
Twelve months ended December 31, 2020 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract liabilities: Deferred revenue | $ | 754,073 | | $ | 198,659 | | $ | 3,038,446 | $ | (2,995,047 | ) | $ | 996,131
Twelve months ended December 31, 2019 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Contract liabilities: Deferred revenue | $ | 723,619 | | $ | - | | $ | 2,637,191 | $ | (2,606,737 | ) | $ | 754,073



i) Rights of return and customer acceptance
 
The Company does not generally offer variable consideration, financing components, rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions, product rotation, or price protection and, therefore, does not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives. Our contracts with customers generally do not include customer acceptance clauses.
 
j) Reseller agreements
 
The Company executes certain sales contracts through resellers. The Company recognizes revenues relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met including passing of control. In addition, the Company assesses the credit-worthiness of each reseller, and if the reseller is undercapitalized or in financial difficulty, any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
 

F-10
----


k) Contract costs
 
The Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We have determined that certain sales commissions meet the requirement to be capitalized, and we amortize these costs on a consistent basis with the pattern of transfer of the goods and services in the contract. Total capitalized costs to obtain contracts were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
 
l) Sales taxes
 
Sales taxes charged to and collected from customers as part of the Company’s sales transactions are excluded from revenues, as well as the determination of transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations, and recorded as a liability to the applicable governmental taxing authority.
 
m) Disaggregation of revenue
 
The Company provides disaggregation of revenue based on product groupings in our consolidated statements of operations as it believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenues from contracts are primarily within the United States. International revenues were not material to the consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
n) Significant financing component
 
The Company’s customers typically do not pay in advance for goods or services to be transferred in excess of one year. As such, it is not necessary to determine if the Company benefits from the time value of money and should record a component of interest income related to the upfront payment due to the practical expedient of ASC 606-10-32-18.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 
The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.
 
The number of customers that comprise the Company’s customer base, along with the different industries, governmental entities and geographic regions, in which the Company’s customers operate, limits concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, with the exception of the State of Michigan. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s sales to the State of Michigan totaled approximately 47% of revenues. The Company has not experienced any losses, nor is not aware of any losses by Graphic Sciences, resulting from nonpayment by the State of Michigan.
 
The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support customer receivables; however, the Company may require its customers to provide retainers, up-front deposits or irrevocable letters-of-credit when considered necessary to mitigate credit risks. The Company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon facts surrounding the credit risk of specific customers and past collections history. Credit losses have been within management’s expectations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was $65,927 and $35,733, respectively.
 

F-11
----

Parts and Supplies
 
Parts and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs are determined using the first-in, first-out method. Parts and supplies are used for scanning and document conversion services. A provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving parts and supplies inventory is made based on parts and supplies levels, future sales forecasted and management’s judgment of potentially obsolete parts and supplies. The Company recorded an allowance of $15,000 at December 31, 2020 and there was no allowance recorded as of December 31, 2019.
Property and Equipment
 
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line basis. Furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and purchased software are depreciated over three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter, generally seven to ten years. Upon retirement or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of these assets are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in the results of operations.
Intangible Assets
 
All intangible assets have finite lives and are stated at cost, net of amortization. Amortization is computed over the useful life of the related assets on a straight-line method.
Goodwill
 
The carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually as of December 31, as well as on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unity may not be recoverable. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recorded fair value.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 
Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.
 
Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group. There were no impairment of long lived assets in the periods ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
 
Purchase Accounting Related Fair Value Measurements
 
The Company allocates the purchase price, including contingent consideration, of its acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Such fair market value assessments are primarily based on third-party valuations using assumptions developed by management that require significant judgments and estimates that can change materially as additional information becomes available. The purchase price allocated to intangibles is based on unobservable factors, including but not limited to, projected revenues, expenses, customer attrition rates, a weighted average cost of capital, among others. The weighted average cost of capital uses a market participant’s cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. The approach to valuing the initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses similar unobservable factors such as projected revenues and expenses over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured, and volatility rates. The Company finalizes the purchase price allocation once certain initial accounting valuation estimates are finalized, and no later than 12 months following the acquisition date.

F-12
----

Leases
 
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases, as a lessee, and no long-term leases for which it is the lessor.
 
ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and reduced by lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation.” Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant.
 
The Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair values on the grant date.
 
The grant date fair value of stock option awards is recognized in earnings as stock-based compensation cost over the requisite service period of the award using the straight-line attribution method. The Company estimates the fair value of the stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The exercise price of options is specified in the stock option agreements. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock for the previous period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based upon a U.S. Treasury instrument with a life that is similar to the expected term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based upon the yield expected on date of grant to occur over the term of the option.

Software Development Costs
 
The Company designs, develops, tests, markets, licenses, and supports new software products and enhancements of current products. The Company continuously monitors its software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. In accordance with ASC 985-20, “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,” the Company expenses software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Once technological feasibility has been established, certain software development costs incurred during the application development stage are eligible for capitalization. Based on the Company’s software development process, technical feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. No such costs were capitalized during the periods presented in this report.
 
In accordance with ASC 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” the Company capitalizes purchase and implementation costs of internal use software. Once an application has reached development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon complete of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable that the expenditure will result in additional functionality. No such costs were capitalized during the periods presented in this report.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, our expensed software development costs were $293,092 and $467,364, respectively.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software
 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which addresses a customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. Under the new guidance, customers will apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for an arrangement that has a software license. ASC 2018-15 was effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020. The Company has concluded that the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is not material.
Fair Value
 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which is guidance that changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820. ASU 2018-13 was effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020. The Company has concluded that the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is not material.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective
 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. ASC 2016-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Reference Rate Reform
 
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” which provides optional relief through specific exceptions and practical expedients for transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The relief generally applies to eligible modifications of contractual terms that change (or have the potential to change) the amount or timing of contractual cash flows related to replacement of a reference rate. The relief allows such modifications to be accounted for as continuations of existing contracts without additional analysis. The optional relief is available from March 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
Income Taxes
 
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” which removes certain exceptions related to intra-period tax allocations and deferred tax accounting on outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries and equity method investments. Additionally, it provides other simplifying measures for the accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU.
Equity Securities, Equity Method Investments and Certain Derivatives
 
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” This ASU clarifies the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments and certain derivatives. The effective date of the standard will be for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 
All other Accounting Standards Updates issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s future consolidated financial statements.

Advertising
 
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. Advertising expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 amounted to $7,362 and $4,255, respectively.
 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 
Basic income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasure stock method. Diluted earnings per share exclude all diluted potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive, including warrants or options which are out-of-the-money and for those periods with a net loss. The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 reported a net loss.
Income Taxes
 
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is computed by applying statutory rates to income before taxes.
 
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as of each period-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A 100% valuation allowance has been established on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize future taxable income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 the Company recovered a net $179,400 of its valuation allowance in conjunction with the consolidation of the net deferred tax liability of its wholly owned subsidiary, Graphic Sciences.
 
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in its consolidated financial statements as required under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” The standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition accounting. Management determined there were no material uncertain positions taken by the Company in its tax returns.
 
Segment Information
 
Operating segments are defined in the criteria established under ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company’s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. These segments contain individual business components that have been combined on the basis of common management, customers, solutions offered, service processes and other economic characteristics. The Company currently has no intersegment sales. The Company evaluates the segments’ performance based on gross profits.

The earnout arrangement for Graphic Sciences requires the Company to pay the seller up to $833,000 annually for a three-year period based on a gross profit level achieved by Graphic Sciences on an annual basis, resulting in a max payout to the seller over a three year period of $2,500,000, as defined, with no minimum requirement. At acquisition, management estimated a fair value of the contingent liability—earnout (“earnout liability”) of $686,200 which would be owed to the seller based on the terms of the earnout, and accordingly, recorded this liability at the acquisition date in accordance with GAAP. At December 31, 2020, the Company accrued an earnout liability of $2,110,000 to reflect the improved performance of the acquisitions against its threshold target and a reduction of uncertainty driven by the pandemic. See Note 8 for the estimated fair value of the earnout liability as of December 31, 2020.


The earnout arrangement for CEO Image requires the Company to pay the seller up to $185,000 annually for a two-year period based on a sales revenue level achieved by certain customers of CEO Image on an annual basis, resulting in a max payout to the seller over a two year period of $370,000, as defined, with no minimum requirement. At acquisition, management estimated a fair value of the earnout liability of $203,000 which would be owed to the seller based on the terms of the earnout, and accordingly, recorded this liability at the acquisition date in accordance with GAAP. At December 31, 2020, the Company accrued an earnout liability of $334,000 to reflect the improved performance of the acquisition against its threshold target and a reduction of uncertainty driven by the pandemic. See Note 8 for the estimated fair value of the earnout liability as of December 31, 2020.

8. | Fair Value Measurements 
---+----------------------------

 
Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
 
The carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and the PPP Note Payable and 2019 Related Notes approximate fair value because of their short maturity. Management believes that the carrying value of the 2020 Notes approximate fair value given the March 2, 2020 transaction proximity to December 31, 2020 in conjunction with the absence of significant net change in the overall economic environment with regards to availability of credit to Company.

(a) | The fair value was based upon Level 2 inputs. See Note 10 for additional information about the Company’s 2016, 2017, and 2018 Unrelated Notes. See Note 11 for additional information about the Company’s 2016, 2017, and 2018 Related Notes. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has earnout liabilities related to acquisitions which are measured on a recurring basis and recorded at fair value, measured using probability-weighted analysis and discounted using a rate that appropriately captures the risks associated with the obligation. The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the earnout liabilities are considered to be Level 3 inputs due to the lack of relevant market activity and significant management judgment. Key unobservable inputs include revenue growth rates, which ranged from 0% to 7%, and volatility rates, which were 20% for gross profits. An increase in future revenues and gross profits may result in a higher estimated fair value while a decrease in future revenues and gross profits may result in a lower estimated fair value of the earnout liabilities.


The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the earnout liabilities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
 

 | December 31, 2020 | 
--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------

The Company has evaluated the terms of its convertible notes payable in accordance with ASC 815 – 40, “Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Stock” and determined that the underlying common stock is indexed to the Company’s common stock. The Company determined that the conversion feature did not meet the definition of a derivative and therefore did not bifurcate the conversion feature and account for it as a separate derivative liability. The Company evaluated the conversion feature for a beneficial conversion feature. The effective conversion price was compared with the market price on the date of each note. If the conversion price was deemed to be less than the market value of the underlying common stock at the inception of the note, then the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature resulting in a discount on the note payable, upon satisfaction of the contingency. The beneficial conversion features were amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective notes, starting from the date of recognition.

----+----------------------------------



From time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation related to employee claims, contractual disputes and taxes in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of such matters, currently the Company has no reason to believe the disposition of any current matter could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or the ability to carry on any of its business activities.
 
Employment Agreements

Under their respective agreements, the executives serve at will and are bound by typical confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions.

Our subsidiary, Graphic Sciences, uses 36,000 square feet of leased space in Madison Heights as its main facility. Graphic Sciences uses about 20,000 square feet for its records storage services, with the remainder of the space used for production, sales, and administration.

The Company has made an accounting policy election to not record a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases, which are defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Instead, the lease payments are recognized as rent expense in the general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations.

14. | Stockholders’ Equity 
----+-------------------------

Description of Authorized Capital
 
The Company is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.001 par value. The holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds. However, the current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of the business. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets of the Company that are legally available for distribution.
Reverse Stock Split
 
Effective February 27, 2020, upon recommendation and authorization by the Board of Directors, stockholders holding a majority in interest of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, acting by written consent, adopted an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) effectuate the Reverse Split at a ratio of one-for-fifty (1-for-50) and (ii) reduce the number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company as of the effective date of such amendment to 25,000,000 shares. On March 3, 2020, the Company filed the Reverse Split Amendment, which became effective on March 20, 2020. On March 1, 2020, upon recommendation and authorization by the Board of Directors, stockholders holding a majority in interest of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, acting by written consent, adopted an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock to 160,000,000 shares (representing 3,200,000 on a post-split basis) from 75,000,000 shares (representing 1,500,000 on a post-split basis), in order to facilitate the acquisition of Graphic Sciences, the 2020 private placement of equity and debt, and the 2020 Note Conversion. On March 2, 2020, the Company filed the Shares Increase Amendment, which was effective immediately upon filing.
 
The reverse stock split did not cause an adjustment to par value of the common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, the Company also adjusted the share amounts for shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, outstanding stock options, and shares reserved for the 2015 Plan. All disclosures of common shares and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related notes have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The December 31, 2019 balances of common stock and additional paid in capital were adjusted to $371 and $14,419,437, from previously reported amounts of $31,528 and $14,388,280, respectively.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $19,129,000 and $18,986,000, respectively, which can be used to offset future federal income tax. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards expire at various dates through 2040. We recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.
