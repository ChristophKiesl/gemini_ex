OVERVIEW
We are a digital payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the unattended retail market. We are transforming the unattended retail world by offering a solution for payments processing, as well as one that handles inventory management, pre-kitting, route logistics, warehouse and back-office management. Our enterprise-wide platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers ranging from vending machine companies to operators of micro-markets, car wash, electric vehicle charging stations, commercial laundry, kiosks, amusements and more, can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively.
We derive the majority of our revenues from license and transaction fees resulting from transactions on, as well as services provided by, our ePort Connect™ and Seed™ software services. These services include digital payment processing, loyalty programs, inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, and responsive merchandising. Devices operating on the Company’s platform and using our services include those resulting from the sale or lease of our point of sale ("POS") electronic payment devices, telemetry devices or certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals or telemetry devices. The majority of ePort Connect customers pay a monthly fee plus a blended transaction rate on transaction volumes. Transactions on the ePort Connect service, are the most significant driver of the Company’s revenues, particularly revenues from software license and transaction fees.
Our customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate primarily in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets including beverage and food vending, amusement and arcade machines, smartphones, commercial laundry, micro-markets, air/vacuum, car wash, electric vehicle, and various other self-serve kiosk applications as well as equipment developers or manufacturers who incorporate our ePort Connect service into their product offerings.

THE INDUSTRY
We serve the small ticket digital payment and unattended retail markets. Our suite of products enable the acceptance of digital payments and allow our customers to simplify inventory, analytics, warehouse, logistics, and back-office management. We believe the following industry trends are driving growth in demand for digital payment systems and advanced logistics management in general and more specifically within the markets we serve:
•Higher demand for and more use of fast, simple and seamless digital purchase and payment experiences
•Many businesses addressed the need for convenience and safety during the pandemic by expanding into unattended retail via vending machines and kiosks;
•COVID-19 spurred continued growth in digital payment adoption, particularly contactless;
•Businesses seek additional services and solutions enabling them to leverage data and business intelligence; and
•Businesses are realizing operational efficiencies through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.
Shift Toward Digital Payments Is Here to Stay.
One lasting impact of COVID-19 was the creation of a ‘new normal’ for businesses and shoppers alike, accelerating the secular shift to touchless commerce. According to “The Visa Back to Business Study 2021 Outlook”; in June 2020 only 20% of small and micro businesses offered contactless payments for the first time, and in 2021, 39% of small and micro businesses report acceptance of new digital forms of payment. In addition, according to the above mentioned report, approximately 65% of consumers in the U.S. would prefer to use contactless payments. The need for convenience and safety have driven the trend, which is expected to continue.
Increasing Consumer Interest In Purchasing Non-Traditional Items through Unattended Retail.
A consumer survey of 2,000 people performed across the United States by the Company and CITE Research found that 82% of respondents have an interest in purchasing nontraditional items through vending machines, and the interest has significantly increased since the last survey in 2019. Clothing and Health and beauty products had the greatest two-year increase with 70% - 71% of respondents interested in purchasing these items from vending machines in 2021 compared to 55% for Clothing and 64% for Health and beauty in 2019 respectively.

As a result, customers can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively. We offer customers several different ways to connect and manage their distributed assets. These range from our QuickConnect Web service, our Seed Cloud platform and our ePort® cashless hardware that can be attached to the door of a stand-alone terminal.

COMPETITION
The unattended retail industry is highly competitive with service providers ranging from well-established enterprises to early stage companies within the financial technology and technology industries. The markets for Cantaloupe’s products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. Many of the company’s competitors are challenging Cantaloupe’s industry leading position, particularly when it comes to pricing, emulating products, services, and marketing, as well as addressing consumer trends. However, we believe we have competitive strengths that position us favorably. 
Consumers are expecting more from their shopping experience, with the intention of having access to buy what they want, when they want, with the ability to pay with any shape or form of digital currency. This has led to a multitude of new devices on the market that are all working towards similar objectives to enable a more engaging experience at the POS. In addition, competitors are entering the market with modernized back-end systems that are focused on the user interface along with real-life product planogram possibilities. 
MARKETS WE SERVE
While the below key verticals represent only a fraction of our total market potential, as described below, these are the areas where we have gained the most traction to date. 

Vending. According to the 2020 Census of the Convenience Services Industry, a study conducted by the NAMA Foundation and research firm Technomic, the US Convenience Services Industry, which consists of vending machines, micro markets, OCS and pantry services, represented total annual revenues of approximately $16 billion in 2020 compared to total annual revenues of approximately $27 billion in 2019, reflecting a reduction of approximately $11 billion and 40%. This was due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Convenience Services Industry is expected to be 64% larger in 2022 compared to 2020, and operators expect a full recovery to 2019 industry levels (pre-pandemic levels) by 2022-2023. In 2020, 80% of the Convenience Services Industry's total annual revenues came from the Vending segment while Micro Markets, OCS and Pantry Services segments represented approximately 12%, 7% and 1% of total annual revenues respectively. 
Kiosk. According to the annually published "2021 Kiosk Market Census Report", for the first time in four years, the self-serve kiosk industry did not post a revenue gain in 2020, driven by the impacts of COVID-19. 
Fortune Business Insights, projects that post pandemic the global kiosk market will grow from $22.7 billion in 2021 to $51.1 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 12.3% over the period. Currently, our existing kiosk customers integrate with our digital payment services via our QuickConnect Web service using one of our encrypted readers or ePort POS technologies.
Laundry. Our primary opportunities in laundry consist of the coin-operated commercial laundry and multi-housing laundry markets. Currently, our joint solution with an industry leader competes with hardware manufacturers, who provide joint solutions to their customers in partnership with payment processors, and with at least one competitor who provides an integrated hardware and payment processing solution.
Amusement and Entertainment. Our current customers and primary opportunities in the amusement and entertainment markets are typically classified as “street/route business,” which are standalone businesses that are open to the general public and that 
offer card/coin-operated games such as claw machines, amusement park machines (i.e. body dryers), bowling alleys and bar entertainment (e.g. digital music machines and dart machines). 
Micro Markets. According to the Automatic Merchandiser’s State of the Industry Annual Report published in July 2021, the vending and micro market business operators surveyed indicated that the number of micro market locations served increased 42% in 2020. This demonstrates that while COVID-19 impacted growth and new location placements in 2020, micro markets still experienced a significant level of growth during the year. We believe the desire to diversify product offerings to employees, while giving them their own convenience store with a micro market, will continue to increase. 
Our primary opportunity in the micro markets vertical is providing a fully integrated solution to our customers which includes a point-of-sale platform and leveraging the Seed Markets offering to optimize our customers payments and logistics services including integrated route scheduling, warehouse pre-picking, and reporting.
Vehicle Services. Our primary opportunities in the vehicle services markets relate to businesses that provide air, vacuum, car wash, electric car charging and parking services. We improve the end customer experience by providing operational efficiency with one platform for cashless acceptance and business optimization. Currently, we partner with a leader in the air vending services by equipping their machines with our cashless acceptance devices. 
OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our primary objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of technology that enables electronic payment transactions, advanced logistics management, and value-added services primarily at small-ticket, self-service retail locations such as vending, kiosks, commercial laundry, and other similar markets. We plan to execute our growth strategy organically and through strategic acquisitions. Key elements of our strategy are to:
Leverage Existing Customers/Partners. Our current customers have seen the benefits of our products and services and we believe they continue to represent the largest opportunity to scale recurring revenue and connections, through the addition of new products and services, as well as expanding our footprint of current product offerings.
Capitalize on the Emerging Contactless, EMV, NFC, and Growing Mobile Payments Trends. With approximately 93% of our digital connected base enabled to accept NFC payments (including mobile wallets), we believe that continued consumer preference towards contactless payments, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay, represent a significant opportunity for the Company to further drive adoption in the current markets in which we provide services and solutions. 
Expand into Micro Markets. In August 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Delicious Nutritious LLC, doing business as Yoke Payments (“Yoke”), a micro market payments company. Through the acquisition, Yoke’s POS platform will now extend its offering to provide self-checkout while seamlessly integrating with Cantaloupe’s inventory management and payment processing platforms. Yoke’s technology currently integrates seamlessly with major platforms, enabling faster onboarding through a plug and play setup that simplifies operations and reduces costs, creating a profitable and scalable micro-market solution for small to medium business; as well as enterprise customers looking to maximize existing locations. We plan to differentiate ourselves by providing a single platform to manage consumer and operational aspects of micro markets, while also integrating multiple service providers for flexibility and ultimate ease to our customers. 
Continuous Innovation. We are continuously enhancing our solutions and services with additional features and functionality. We are making investments in new products and services, and continuously partnering with other players within the ecosystem to drive additional value of combined service offerings to our customers and opportunities. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of Cantaloupe’s solutions and services in the unattended POS payments market.
Comprehensive Service and Support. In addition to its industry-leading ePort digital payments system and Seed logistics software, the Company seeks to provide its customers with a comprehensive, value-added ePort Connect and Seed service that is designed to encourage optimal return on investment through business planning and performance optimization; acceptance of crypto payments, and a loyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; marketing strategy and executional support; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend digital payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operator’s business including the micro-markets contract food industry, online payments and mobile payments.
Further Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We plan to continue to introduce our turn-key solutions and services to various adjacent markets such as the broad-based kiosk market and other similar markets by leveraging our expertise in digital payment integration combined with the capacity and uniqueness of our Seed platform. We plan to leverage the Seed platform to extend route optimization tools into other verticals where static schedules are not optimal for service visits. In addition, Seed Pro’s patented dynamic route scheduling capabilities can support optimal servicing and decreased operational costs. 
Capitalize on Opportunities in International Markets. We are currently focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets for our ePort devices and related ePort Connect service and Seed Cloud, but may seek to establish a presence in electronic payment markets outside of the U.S. and Canada. In order to do so, we have dedicated sales resources to spearhead international opportunities, starting with Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales strategy includes both direct sales and channel development, depending on the particular dynamics of each of our markets. Our direct sale efforts are supported by both inside and external sales team members, which are aligned to serve our enterprise and our small- and medium-business (SMB) customers and prospects. In order to expand our sales reach, we have agreements with resellers in select market segments. Our marketing strategy includes advertising and outreach initiatives designed to build brand awareness, position our company’s thought leadership within unattended retail, make clear our competitive strengths, and prove the value of our products and services to our opportunity markets. Activities include creating a vibrant company and product presence on the web, digital advertising, Search Engine Optimization ("SEO"), and social media; the use of direct mail and email campaigns; educational and instructional online training sessions; content curation through blogs, whitepapers, guides, podcasts, and joint industry studies; advertising in vertically-oriented trade publications; participating in industry tradeshows and events; and working closely with customers and key strategic partners on co-marketing opportunities that drive customer and consumer adoption of our services.
As of June 30, 2021, we are marketing and selling our products primarily through our full and part-time sales and marketing staff consisting of 35 people.
IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS
Our most important relationships are with our almost 20,000 customers, which are governed by services agreements that provide for terms and conditions of purchase, rental, or lease of the devices, licensing of our solutions, and processing services. Under the terms, we typically collect our fees from settled funds, including activation fees, monthly service fees, and transaction processing fees. Our relationships with certain large customers are governed by customized terms and conditions contained within individually negotiated services agreements. 
We maintain broad and long-standing relationships with card industry associations, including our listing on the Visa Global Registry of Service Providers. From time to time, we enter into short-term incentive and promotional agreements with the card industry counterparties. 
We maintain close relationships with domestic wireless telecommunications carriers and with which we have long-term bespoke pricing and support terms. 
We have long-term agreements with our payment processors, each of which is seamlessly integrated with our products and customers. 
As part of our strategy to expand our sales reach while optimizing resources, we have agreements with select resellers within the industries we serve. 
Lastly, we have a number of key vendors supporting our network environment and technology, our product development and our product offerings.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN
We utilize independent third-party manufacturing partners to produce the substantial majority of our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers. Production by our manufacturing partners is performed in accordance with our product specifications, quality control and compliance standards. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 our manufacturing activities principally took place in the United States and Mexico. 
Our internal processes center around quality assurance of materials and testing of finished goods received from our contract manufacturers. 
As a result of COVID-19, the technology industry is experiencing some delays within supply chain. We have not experienced significant disruptions to date; however we are continually monitoring and evaluating manufacturing partners to accommodate our expected growth and minimize potential risks of disruption within our supply chain operations.

Of the 132 patents, 54 are still in force at June 30, 2021. Our patents expire between 2021 and 2038. 
ACTIVE DEVICES AND ACTIVE CUSTOMERS
During fiscal year 2021, management updated the business metrics we use for insight into the Company’s performance and growth trends. We discontinued tracking and reporting connections and now provide information on Active Devices and Active Customers, which we believe is a better representation of our business. 
Active Devices are devices that have communicated with us or have had a transaction in the last twelve months. Included in the number of Active Devices are devices that communicate through other devices that communicate or transact with us. A self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one device. 
We define Active Customers as all customers with at least one active device.
We had 19,834 Active Customers and 1.09 million Active Devices connected to our service as of June 30, 2021 compared to 17,249 Active Customers and 1.08 million Active Customers as of June 30, 2020.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of June 30, 2021, the Company had 181 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees compared to 141 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees as of June 30, 2020. This represents a headcount increase of approximately 26% over prior year. Headcount growth has occurred primarily in our Sales, Customer Support and Technology departments to support our expanding business and execute our strategic initiatives including continued investing in our integrated product offering and providing highest levels of customer service. Headcount also increased in our Finance and Accounting department as we reduced our reliance on third party consultants for accounting and reporting related support. We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We seek employees who share a passion for our technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses. 
We also use temporary employees and contractors in the ordinary course of business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
We offer our employees wages and benefit packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry. In addition to salaries, we provide benefits that include a 401(k) retirement savings plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, as well as other benefits including a paid parental leave policy. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees while continuing to diligently serve our customers. An internal task force was created at the start of the pandemic to develop measures to protect the business in light of the volatility and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented significant changes such as having most of our employees work from home until the pandemic eases while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work at either the Company or customers’ locations. We have taken, and will continue to take, actions in accordance with the applicable local guidance, such as the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, to protect our employees so they can safely and effectively perform their work.
Annually we ask our employees to complete a Company-wide employee engagement survey. The survey is facilitated internally through our Human Resources department. The survey reflects questions to gauge employee sentiments toward current trends and issues including company direction and strategy, communication by management, individual development, team culture, and overall satisfaction. With the information provided by the annual engagement survey, leadership is provided key insights and valuable feedback which we continue to implement in our Company-wide action plans with the intent to focus on key areas to prioritize, enhance, and drive continued increase in employee engagement, learning and development, and professional growth for our employees.
