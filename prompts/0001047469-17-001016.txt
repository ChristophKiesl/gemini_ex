 Overview 
         We are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. Since our entry into this business in 2010, we have executed multiple long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large scale power generators and have built and acquired the production and terminaling capacity necessary to serve them. Our existing production constitutes approximately 14% of current global utility-grade wood pellet production capacity and the product we deliver to our customers typically comprises a material portion of their fuel supply. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.8 million metric tons per year ("MTPY"). Four of our production plants are new facilities that we constructed using our templated design and standardized equipment. A fifth plant, our largest in terms of production capacity, has been in operation since 2008. We also own a dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake (the "Chesapeake terminal") that reduces our storage and shiploading costs and enables us to reliably supply our customers. All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged, fully-contracted assets in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that we anticipate will enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective. 
         We were formed on November 12, 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor. On April 9, 2015, our sponsor contributed some but not all of our Predecessor's assets and liabilities to us. On May 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. Our assets and operations are organized into a single reportable segment and are all located and conducted in the United States. Please read Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 1, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation" for further discussion regarding our formation and organization. 
 Industry Overview 
         Our principal product, utility-grade wood pellets, is a globally traded energy commodity that is used as a substitute for coal in both dedicated and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. It enables major power generators to profitably generate electricity in a manner that reduces the overall cost of compliance with mandatory GHG emissions limits and renewable energy targets while also allowing countries to diversify their sources of electricity supply. 
 5

          Unlike intermittent sources of renewable generation like wind and solar power, wood pellet-fired plants are capable of meeting baseload electricity demand and are dispatchable (that is, power output can be switched on or off or adjusted based on demand). As a result, utilities and major power generators in Europe and Asia have made and continue to make long-term, profitable investments in power-plant conversions and new builds of generating assets that either co-fire wood pellets with coal or are fully dedicated wood pellet-fired plants. Such developments help generators in European and Asian markets maintain and increase baseload generating capacity, comply with binding climate change regulations and other emissions reduction targets and increase renewable energy usage at a lower cost to consumers and taxpayers than other forms of energy generation. 
         The capital costs required to convert a coal plant to co-fire biomass, or to burn biomass exclusively, are a fraction of the capital costs associated with implementing offshore wind and most other renewable technologies. Furthermore, the relatively quick process of converting coal-fired plants to biomass-fired generation is an attractive benefit for power generators whose generation assets are no longer viable as coal plants due to the expiration of operating permits or the introduction of taxes or other restrictions on fossil fuel usage or emissions of GHGs and other pollutants. 
         There also continues to be significant growth in the European and Asian demand for wood pellets as the preferred fuel source and lower-cost alternative to delivered fossil fuels for district heating loops, for heating homes and commercial buildings and for the production of process heat at industrial sites. Increasingly, wood pellets are also being sought as a raw material input for bio-based substitutes for traditional fossil fuel-based fuels and chemicals. As these markets further develop, there will continue to be opportunities for utility-grade wood pellet producers to serve this growing demand. 
   Our Assets and Operations 
         We procure wood fiber and process it into utility-grade wood pellets. We load the finished wood pellets into railcars, trucks and barges that are transported to deep-water marine terminals, where they are received, stored and ultimately loaded onto oceangoing vessels for transport to our principally Northern European customers. 
         Our customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants. Wood pellets serve as a suitable "drop-in" alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content, density and form. Due to the uninterruptible nature of our customers' fuel consumption, our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality, and our proven track record enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty. In addition to our customers' focus on the reliability of supply, they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling. Because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density, particle size distribution, ash/inert content and moisture, our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and, in some cases, provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications. 
   Recent Developments 
   Japanese Market 
         In addition to growing demand in Europe for our product, we believe there will be strong demand for wood pellets in Japan due to the government's drive toward reducing carbon emissions and a general shortfall in the supply of power from sources that reduce carbon emissions due to challenges with the country's nuclear power fleet. Nearly 3.2 gigawatts of biomass-fired capacity, implying demand of more than 10.0 million MTPY of biomass, have been approved through Japan's feed-in-tariff program, of which approximately 500 megawatts are commissioned. Power plant operators, project sponsors, and major trading houses are looking to secure long-term supply agreements with reliable 
 6

  counterparties. Because of the low marginal cost of fiber combined with low long-term bulk shipping prices, the Southeastern United States is one of the most competitive sources of biomass for Japan, and we expect that trade flow will create significant opportunities for the U.S. wood pellet industry. 
   Sampson Drop-Down 
         On December 14, 2016, we consummated the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC ("Sampson"), along with off-take contracts and related shipping contracts described below. We refer to this transaction as the "Sampson Drop-Down." 
         Sampson owns a wood pellet production plant located in Sampson County, North Carolina, that is expected to produce 500,000 MTPY of wood pellets in 2017 and to reach its full production capacity of approximately 600,000 MTPY in 2019. The Sampson Drop-Down also included a ten-year, 420,000 MTPY take-or-pay off-take contract with DONG Energy Thermal Power A/S ("DONG Energy"), a 15-year, 95,000 MTPY off-take contract with the Hancock JV and related third-party shipping contracts. With this transaction, our production capacity increased 22% to 2.8 million MTPY. 
         The purchase price for the Sampson Drop-Down was $175.0 million and was financed with $145.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of our Senior Notes (as defined herein) and the issuance of 1,098,415 common units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership ("common units") at a value of $27.31 per unit, or $30.0 million of common units, to affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company. We accounted for the Sampson Drop-Down as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition were retrospectively recast to reflect the acquisition as if it had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson was originally organized. 
         In connection with the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down, Enviva, LP entered into a Terminal Services Agreement (the "Terminal Services Agreement") with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hancock JV, which owns a dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Wilmington (the "Wilmington terminal"). Wood pellets produced at our Sampson plant are transported by truck to the Wilmington terminal, where they are received, stored and ultimately loaded onto oceangoing vessels for transport to our customers. For more information, please read Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceAgreements with AffiliatesBiomass Purchase and Chesapeake Terminal Services Agreements." 
         On November 24, 2015, Enviva Port of Chesapeake. LLC, the entity which owns the Chesapeake terminal, and Sampson entered into a Terminal Services Agreement (the "Prior TSA") pursuant to which we would have provided terminal services at the Chesapeake terminal for production from the Sampson plant prior to the completion of the Wilmington terminal. On September 26, 2016, Enviva, LP and Sampson entered into two confirmations under an agreement (the "Biomass Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Enviva, LP agreed to sell to Sampson 140,000 MT of wood pellets, and Sampson agreed to purchase from Enviva, LP 140,000 MT of wood pellets. On December 14, 2016, the Prior TSA and the Biomass Purchase Agreement were terminated in connection with the Sampson Drop-Down. For more information, please read Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceAgreements with AffiliatesBiomass Purchase and Chesapeake Terminal Service Agreements." 
   Amendment to Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
         In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the "Credit Agreement Amendment"). The Credit Agreement 
 7

  Amendment, which became effective upon the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down, increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $25.0 million to $100.0 million. 
   Senior Notes Due 2021 
         On November 1, 2016, we and Enviva Partners Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership formed on October 3, 2016 for the purpose of being the co-issuer of these notes, issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "Senior Notes") to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand and $30.0 million in common units issued to the Hancock JV, funded the consideration payable in connection with the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes was used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. With the repayment of certain term loan indebtedness, our revolver capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million per the Credit Agreement Amendment. The Senior Notes initially will be subject to certain terms and exceptions and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries. 
   Sale of the Wiggins Plant 
         In December 2016, we initiated a plan to sell our 110,000 MTPY production plant located in Wiggins, Mississippi (the "Wiggins plant"). Growth projects and productivity improvements at our larger plants during 2016 and 2015 resulted in greater production volumes, which replaced the Wiggins plant's production capacity at a significantly lower cost position. The carrying amount of the assets held for sale exceeded the estimated fair value of the Wiggins plant, which resulted in a $10.0 million non-cash impairment charge to earnings. On January 20, 2017, the sales agreement terminated when the buyer failed to pay the purchase price. Subsequently, we ceased operations but the Wiggins plant remains available for immediate sale. 
   At-the-Market Offering Program 
         On August 8, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration filed with the United States Securities Exchange Act Commission ("SEC") on June 24, 2016, for the continuous offering of up to $100.0 million of common units, in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings. In August 2016, we also entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "Equity Distribution Agreement") with certain managers pursuant to which we may offer and sell common units from time to time through or to one or more of the managers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement, of up to an aggregate sales amount of $100.0 million (the "ATM Program"). 
         During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 358,593 common units under the Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $9.3 million, net of $0.1 million of commissions. Deferred issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million, primarily consisting of legal, accounting and other fees, were offset against the proceeds. Net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program were used for general partnership purposes. As of February 15, 2017, $89.0 million remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.

    Assets and Operations 
   Our Production Plants 
         We own and operate six industrial-scale wood pellet production plants located in the Mid-Atlantic and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, geographic areas in which wood fiber resources are plentiful and readily available. These facilities are designed to run 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, although we schedule up to 15 days of maintenance for our plants during each calendar year. There are no regularly required major turnarounds or overhauls. 
 Mid-Atlantic Region Plants 
         The following table describes our four wood pellet production plants in the Mid-Atlantic region: 

   
Plant Location | | Operations Commenced | | Current Annual Production (MTPY) | 
Ahoskie, North Carolina | | | 2011 | | | 375,000 | 
Northampton, North Carolina | | | 2013 | | | 525,000 | 
Sampson, North Carolina | | | 2016 | | | 500,000 | 
Southampton, Virginia | | | 2013 | | | 515,000 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Total | | | | | | 1,915,000 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​




Ahoskie 

         We acquired the site of the Ahoskie plant in December 2010 and constructed a dedicated wood pellet production plant in Ahoskie, North Carolina (the "Ahoskie plant") in less than one year, commencing operations in November 2011. Through an expansion completed in June 2012, we increased the plant's production from 260,000 MTPY to 350,000 MTPY and have made further improvements to increase production to its current capacity of 375,000 MTPY. 
         Production from the Ahoskie plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal. 
 


Northampton 

         Our wood pellet production plant in Northampton, North Carolina (the "Northampton plant") was constructed based on the Ahoskie plant design, utilizing the same major equipment suppliers. The Northampton plant currently produces 525,000 MTPY of wood pellets. 
         Production from the Northampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal. 
 


Sampson 

         The Sampson plant, which we acquired from the Hancock JV in December 2016, commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2016. The Sampson plant was built based on our templated design and we believe that it will produce 500,000 MTPY of wood pellets in 2017. We expect the Sampson plant to reach an annual production capacity of 600,000 MTPY by 2019. 
         Production from the Sampson plant is transported by truck to the Wilmington terminal. 
 


Southampton 

         We acquired a wood pellet production plant in Southampton County, Virginia (the "Southampton plant") from the Hancock JV in December 2015 (the "Southampton Drop-Down"). The Southampton 
 9

  plant is a build-and-copy replica of our Northampton plant and currently produces 515,000 MTPY of wood pellets. 
         Production from the Southampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal. 
 


Gulf Coast Region Plants 

         The following table describes our two wood pellet production plants in the Gulf Coast region: 

   
Plant Location | | Acquisition Date | | Current Annual Production (MTPY) | 
Cottondale, Florida | | | 2015 | | | 720,000 | 
Amory, Mississippi | | | 2010 | | | 120,000 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Total | | | | | | 840,000 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​




Cottondale 

         Our sponsor acquired Green Circle Bio Energy, Inc., which owns a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the "Cottondale Plant"), in January 2015, changed the name of this entity to Enviva Pellets Cottondale, LLC ("Cottondale") and contributed Cottondale to us in April 2015. The Cottondale plant was commissioned in 2008 and has since undergone several expansion and process improvements. Expansion projects during 2015 and 2016 increased production from 700,000 MTPY to 720,000 MTPY. 
         Production from the Cottondale plant is transported approximately 50 miles by short-line rail to a warehouse in Port Panama City, Florida, where we store up to 32,000 MT of inventory. 
 


Amory 

         We purchased the Amory plant in August 2010. The plant initially consisted of three pellet mills producing at a rate of 41,500 MTPY. Through basic operational improvements and installation of a fourth pellet mill, the Amory plant currently produces 120,000 MTPY. 
         Production from the Amory plant is transported by barge to a third-party deep-water marine terminal in Mobile, Alabama (the "Mobile terminal"). 
   Logistics and Storage Capabilities 
 


To-Port Logistics and Port Infrastructure 

         We site our production plants to minimize wood fiber procurement and logistics costs. Our production plants are strategically located in advantaged fiber baskets and near multiple truck, rail, river and ocean transportation access points. We also have inland waterway access and rail access at our Chesapeake terminal and in Port Panama City. Our multi-year fixed-cost contracts with third-party logistics providers allow for long-term visibility into our to-port logistics cost structure. 
         The wood pellets produced at our plants must be stored, terminaled and shipped to our European customers. Limited deep-water, bulk terminaling assets exist in the Southeastern United States, and very few of them have the appropriate handling and storage infrastructure necessary for receiving, storing and loading wood pellets. In response to such scarcity, we have vertically integrated our Mid-Atlantic operations downstream to encompass finished product logistics and storage. As a largely fixed cost and capital intensive piece of the value chain, our port infrastructure allows us to ship incremental product from our regional plants at a small fraction of the cost of our competitors. 
 10

  Management of port terminal infrastructure is also a key element in reducing distribution-related costs as it allows us to manage the arrival and loading of vessels. Additionally, we are able to improve our cost position by maintaining a dedicated berth where pellets from our Mid-Atlantic region plants have priority and equipment with sufficient load rate capabilities to turn around vessels within the allotted time windows. 
         In addition to terminaling wood pellets from our production plants, we will, on occasion, provide terminaling services for third-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other bulk commodities. 
 


Port Operation in the Mid-Atlantic Region 

         We acquired a deep-water marine terminal located at the Port of Chesapeake in January 2011 and converted it into a major dry-bulk terminal. The Chesapeake terminal receives, stores and loads wood pellets for export and serves as the shipment point for products produced at our Ahoskie, Northampton and Southampton plants. The Chesapeake terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a 200-car rail yard adjacent to a Norfolk Southern track, a loading/unloading system that accommodates deliveries by truck, rail and barge and a highly automated conveying system. In May 2011, we erected a 157-foot tall, 175-foot wide storage dome that receives, stores and loads up to 45,000 MT of wood pellets. In April 2013, we placed into operation a second storage dome at the site to add an additional 45,000 MT of storage. 
         The Chesapeake terminal's storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of the wood pellets produced from our Mid-Atlantic region plants, and its location decreases our customers' transportation time and costs. Efficiently positioned near our Ahoskie, Northampton, and Southampton plants, the Chesapeake terminal delivers up to a three- to four-day European shipping advantage compared to other Southern or Gulf Coast ports. In addition, because we own the Chesapeake terminal, we enjoy preferential berth access and loading, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without the need for excess storage. Our ownership and operation of this terminal enable us to control shipment of the production of our Mid-Atlantic region plants. 
         Wood pellets produced at our Sampson plant are terminaled at the Wilmington terminal pursuant to a terminal services agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hancock JV. The Wilmington terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a receiving system that accommodates deliveries by truck and rail, a highly automated conveying system and two wood pellet storage domes with capacities of 45,000 MT each. The Wilmington terminal's storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of pellets produced from our Sampson plant and its location decreases transportation time and costs through the entire supply chain. We benefit from preferential berth access and loading at the Wilmington terminal, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without the need for excess storage. 
 


Port Operation in the Gulf Coast Region 

         Wood pellets from our Cottondale plant are transported via short-line rail to the Panama City terminal where we store up to 32,000 MT of inventory in a warehouse at Port Panama City. Production from the Cottondale plant is received, stored and loaded under a long-term warehouse service agreement with the Port Authority and a stevedoring contract, each of which runs through June 2018. We have the right to extend the warehouse services agreement for up to five additional two-year terms. 
         Wood pellets produced at our Amory plant are transported by barge to the Mobile terminal, where, pursuant to a long-term throughput agreement with Cooper Marine & Timberlands ("Cooper"), we export from Cooper's ChipCo terminal. This privately owned and maintained deep-water, multi-berth terminal operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week and is the fleeting and loading point for production from our Amory plant. The Amory plant is sited along a major inland waterway that makes 
 11

  transportation to the Mobile terminal easy and efficient, thereby reducing emissions and costs. Our ability to store our wood pellets in barges provides a capital-light, flexible solution that accommodates the storage needs of the Amory plant. 
         Please read Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary DataSignificant Accounting PoliciesSegment and Geographic Information" for more information regarding our plants, terminals and other long-lived assets. 
   Our Sponsor's Assets and Development Projects 
         In connection with the closing of the IPO, we entered into a purchase rights agreement (the "Purchase Rights Agreement") with our sponsor, pursuant to which our sponsor granted us a five-year right of first offer to acquire any wood pellet production plants and associated deep-water marine terminals that it or the Hancock JV may develop or acquire and elect to sell. We expect to pursue the acquisition of such assets to the extent that they are supported by long-term off-take contracts with creditworthy counterparties and have long useful lives, stable cost positions and advantaged locations. 
   Long-Term, Take-or-Pay Off-Take Contracts 
         In January 2016, the Hancock JV entered into a take-or-pay off-take contract (the "MGT Contract") with MGT Power to be the sole source of nearly 1.0 million MTPY of imported wood pellets for the Teesside Renewable Energy Plant (the "Tees REP"), which is currently under development. Deliveries under the MGT Contract are expected to commence in 2019 and continue through 2034. Following the execution of the MGT Contract, we entered into a contract with the Hancock JV (the "EVA-MGT Contract") to supply 375,000 MTPY of the contracted volume to the Tees REP. In August 2016, the MGT Contract and the EVA-MGT Contract became firm as all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the contracts were satisfied. For more information on the EVA-MGT Contract, please read "CustomersEVA-MGT Contracts" below. 
         In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, we entered into a second supply agreement with the Hancock JV to supply an additional 95,000 MTPY of the contracted volume to the Tees REP. For more information on the second contract with the Hancock JV, please read Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships Transactions, and Director IndependenceAgreements with AffiliatesEVA-MGT Contracts". 
   Sponsor Development Projects 
 


Wilmington Terminal 

         The Hancock JV completed construction of the Wilmington terminal in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Wilmington terminal is contracted for shipments of approximately 1.0 million MTPY, including production from the Sampson plant and a third-party plant in South Carolina. 
 


Hamlet Plant 

         Our sponsor has secured permits and commenced detailed design for a production plant located near Hamlet, North Carolina (the "Hamlet plant"), which is strategically sited in an attractive wood fiber basket and will be constructed using our "build-and-copy" approach, using substantially the same design and equipment as the Sampson plant. Production from the Hamlet plant, once completed, is expected to be terminaled at the Wilmington terminal. 
 12





Other Sponsor Development Projects 

         In addition to the projects discussed above, our sponsor is pursuing the development of additional deep-water marine terminals and production plants. Our sponsor has executed an agreement with the Jackson County Port Authority granting our sponsor an option to build and operate a marine export terminal at the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, which would service new, regionally proximate production plants, including a potential production plant in Lucedale, Mississippi. 
         Although we expect to continue to have the opportunity to acquire assets, including those described above, from our sponsor or the Hancock JV in the future pursuant to the Purchase Rights Agreement, there can be no assurance that our sponsor or the Hancock JV will complete its development projects or that our sponsor will decide to sell, or compel the Hancock JV to sell, assets or completed development projects to us. 
   Customers 
         For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated substantially all of our revenues from sales under long-term take-or-pay off-take contracts with customers outside of the United States. We seek to contract a substantial portion of our production through long-term off-take contracts supplemented by smaller contracts of intermediate or short duration to take advantage of opportunities in the market. 
         Depending on the specific take-or-pay off-take contract, shipping terms are either "Cost, Insurance and Freight" ("CIF") or "Free On Board" ("FOB"). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. These costs are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under an FOB contract, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. We have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping. 
         We have take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large European power generators such as Drax Power Limited ("Drax"), DONG Energy, Lynemouth Power Limited ("Lynemouth Power"), Engie Energy Management SCRL ("Engie") and MGT Power through a contract with the Hancock JV. Our off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.7 million MT of wood pellets in 2017 and have a weighted average remaining term of 9.8 years from February 1, 2017. Contracted volumes for 2017 are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated, and we expect to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations with currency derivatives and other offsets. As our current off-take contracts expire, we will seek to recontract our capacity with a combination of renewals with existing customers, the acquisition of additional contracts from the Hancock JV and the entry into contracts with new customers. 
  Drax Contracts.    We began selling utility-grade wood pellets pursuant to a contract with Drax (the "First Drax Contract") on April 1, 2013. We supplied 468,750 MT for the first delivery year and will supply 1.0 million MTPY of wood pellets through 2022. In connection with the Southampton Drop-Down, the Hancock JV assigned to us a ten-year contract with Drax (the "Second Drax Contract"). The Second Drax Contract commenced on December 1, 2015, and we supplied 385,000 MT for the first delivery year and will supply 500,000 MTPY for years two through ten. 
  DONG Contract.    In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, the Hancock JV assigned us a ten-year take-or-pay off-take contract with DONG Energy. This contract commenced September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. DONG Energy's obligations under the contract are guaranteed by its parent, DONG Energy A/S. 
         Lynemouth Power Contract.    We entered into a take-or-pay off-take contract to supply wood pellets to Lynemouth Power. Lynemouth Power is converting its coal-fired power station in the United 
 13

  Kingdom to a biomass fired power station. Deliveries under this contract are expected to commence in late 2017, ramp to full supply of 800,000 MTPY of wood pellets in 2018, and continue through the first quarter of 2027. The sales volumes under the Lynemouth Power Contract are denominated in U.S. Dollars, except for 160,000 MTPY that are denominated in British Pound Sterling ("GBP"). 
  Engie.    We began selling 480,000 MTPY of utility-grade wood pellets to Electrabel, a subsidiary of ENGIE, in June 2011. The initial contract term is expected to expire in June 2017. 
  EVA-MGT Contracts.    We have contracted with the Hancock JV to supply 375,000 MTPY to the Tees REP. The EVA-MGT Contract is denominated in GBP and commences in 2019, ramps to full supply in 2021, and continues through 2034. In August 2016, the EVA-MGT Contract became firm as all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the contract were satisfied. 
         In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, we entered into a second contract with the Hancock JV to supply an additional 95,000 MTPY of the contracted volume to the Tees REP. For more information on the EVA-MGT Contracts, please read Part III, Item 13. "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceAgreements with AffiliatesEVA-MGT Contracts." 
         We refer to the structure of our contracts as "take-or-pay" because they include a firm obligation to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that compensate us in the case of our customer's failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination by our customer. Our contracts provide for annual inflation-based adjustments or price escalators. Certain of our contracts also contain provisions that allow us to increase or decrease the volume of product that we deliver by a percentage of the base volume of the contract, as well as cost pass-through provisions related to stumpage (i.e., the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material), fuel or transportation costs and price adjustments for actual product specifications. In addition, certain of our contracts and related arrangements provide for certain cost recovery and sharing arrangements in connection with certain changes in law or sustainability requirements and for payments to us in the case of termination as a result of such changes. 
         In addition to our long-term contracts, we also sell product under limited-scope contracts. On occasion, we will intermediate dislocations in the market by entering into back-to-back transactions with physical delivery. We also provide terminaling services for other bulk commodities and fiber procurement services for domestic users of wood fiber. 
   Contracted Backlog 
         As of February 1, 2017, we had approximately $5.7 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to major power generators. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contract. Expected future product sales revenue denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2017 forward rates. Please read Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary DataDerivative Instruments" for more information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts. 
         Our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 1, 2017 is as follows (in millions):

    Wood Fiber Procurement 
         Although stumpage (i.e., the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material) constitutes less than 20% of our total cost of delivered products, wood fiber procurement is a vital function of our business, and cost-effective access to wood fiber is an important factor in our pricing stability. Our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally the tops and limbs of trees as well as other low-value wood materials that are generated in a harvest. We procure wood fiber directly from timber owners, loggers and other suppliers. We also opportunistically acquire industrial residuals (sawdust and shavings) and forest residuals (woodchips and slash) when they provide a cost advantage. Due to the moisture content of unprocessed wood, it cannot be transported economically over long distances. Therefore, the specific regional wood fiber resource supply and demand balance dictates the underlying economics of wood fiber procurement. For this reason, we have elected to site our facilities in some of the most robust and advantaged fiber baskets in the world. 
         Our customers are subject to stringent requirements regarding the sustainability of the fuels they procure. In addition to our internal sustainability policies and initiatives, our wood fiber procurement is conducted in accordance with leading forest certification standards. Our wood pellet production plants and their associated fiber supply chains have been audited by independent third parties and certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®) fiber sourcing standard and have achieved chain-of-custody certifications to the Forest Stewardship CouncilTM (FSC®) and the Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). Our Southampton plant, Sampson plant and Cottondale plant have achieved Sustainable Biomass Partnership (SBP) certification and we expect to achieve certification for our remaining plants in 2017. In addition, we proactively work with all of our suppliers to promote responsible forest management on all lands, not just those that are already certified. 
         Our wood fiber demand is complementary to, rather than in competition with, demand for high-grade wood for use by most other forest-related industries, such as lumber and furniture making. Improvements in the U.S. housing construction industry increase the demand for construction-quality lumber, which in turn increases the available supply of the low-cost pulpwood and mill residues that are used in wood pellet production. By using commercial thinnings and byproducts as raw materials, wood pellet production also indirectly supports other forest-related industries as well as the sustainable management of commercial forests. 
         The wood fiber used for wood pellet production comprises predominantly pulpwood, which derives its name from its traditional use by the pulp and paper industry and includes roundwood (typically thinnings from forest management operations and the tops and branches from sawlogs), and wood residues (primarily mill residues, a byproduct of sawmilling and veneer mill operations). Our procured wood fiber consists of:
 

 Low-grade wood fiber: wood that is unsuitable for or rejected by the sawmilling and lumber industries because of small size, defects
(e.g. crooked or knotty), disease or pest infestation; 
 Tops and limbs: the parts of trees that cannot be processed into lumber; 
 Commercial thinnings: harvests that promote the growth of higher value timber by removing weaker or deformed trees to reduce competition for
water, nutrients and sunlight; and 
 Mill residues: chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts. 

         Demand for the non-merchantable trees, waste products or byproducts that we use is generally low because they have few competing uses. The tops, limbs and other low-grade wood fiber we purchase would otherwise generally be left on the forest floor, impeding reforestation, or burned. Wood pellet production provides a profitable use for the residues from sawmill and furniture industries and for the trees that are thinned to make room for higher value lumber-grade timber. U.S. demand for such low 
 15

  grade wood fiber historically emerged from the pulp and paper industry. However, due to the decline in demand from paper and pulp, many landowners lack commercial markets for this wood fiber. Wood pellet producers help fill the gap. 
         As a result of the fragmented nature of tract ownership, we procure raw materials from hundreds of landowners, loggers and timber industry participants, with no individual landowner representing a material fraction of any of our production plants' needs. Our wood fiber is procured under a range of arrangements, including (1) the direct purchase of timber tracts or harvesting rights which provide an inventory of stumpage, (2) logging contracts for the thinnings, pulpwood and other unmerchandised chip-and-saw timber cut by a harvester, (3) in-woods chipping contracts where we may also provide the actual harvesting assets and (4) contracts with timber dealers. Via our internal Track and Trace system, we maintain 100% traceability of the wood that is delivered to us directly from forests. Any supplier delivering wood to one of our plants must first share the details about the forest characteristics of the tract from which the wood is sourced with our forestry staff so we can verify that it meets our strict sustainability criteria. Our supplier contracts require a certification that the relevant tract information has been entered into our database before wood may be delivered directly from a particular tract. We summarize all such tract information periodically and publish tract-level details on our website. We have sourced wood fiber from more than 500 suppliers, including landowners growing both hardwoods and softwoods and other suppliers. The diversity of our supply base enables us to maintain stable costs, and our facilities' advantaged siting ensures consistent and reliable deliveries at lower cost than others in our region or industry. 
   Competition 
         We compete with other utility-grade wood pellet producers for long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with major power generation customers. Competition in our industry is based on the price, quality and consistency of the wood pellets produced, the reliability of wood pellet deliveries and the producer's ability to verify and document, through customer and third-party audits, that its wood pellets meet the regulatory sustainability obligations of a particular customer. 
         Most of the world's current wood pellet production plants are owned by small, private companies, with few companies owning or operating multiple plants. Few companies have the scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure necessary to supply utility-grade wood pellets under large, long-term off-take contracts with power generators. We are the largest producer by production capacity, and consider the limited number of other companies with comparable scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure to be our competitors. 
         Other current producers of utility-grade wood pellets include Graanul Invest Group, Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, Georgia Biomass, LLC, Rentech Inc., Pacific BioEnergy, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., The Navigator Company, S.A., Highland Pellets and The Westervelt Company. 
   Employees 
         We are party to a management services agreement with Enviva Management, pursuant to which Enviva Management provides us with the employees, management and services necessary for the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2016, Enviva Management had 612 employees. Please read Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary DataRelated Party Transactions" for more information regarding our management services agreement with Enviva Management. 
 Our Relationship with Our Sponsor 
         Our sponsor, Enviva Holdings, LP, is a majority owned subsidiary of the Riverstone Funds. 
 16

          Our sponsor owns approximately 9% of our common units, all of our subordinated units and our General Partner. Our General Partner owns our incentive distribution rights, which entitles our General Partner to increasing percentages of our cash distribution above certain targets. As a result, our sponsor is incentivized to facilitate our access to accretive acquisition and organic growth opportunities, including those pursuant to the right of first offer it granted to us in connection with our IPO. 
         In November 2014, our sponsor entered into the Hancock JV with Hancock Natural Resource Group, Inc. and certain other affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company. Our sponsor is the managing member and operator of the Hancock JV and is responsible for managing the activities of the Hancock JV, including the development and construction of the Hancock JV's development projects. 
   Environmental Matters 
         Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including environmental protection, occupational health and safety and the release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions and wastewater discharges. These laws and regulations may (i) require acquisition, compliance with and maintenance of certain permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, (ii) impose technology requirements or standards on our operations, (iii) restrict the amounts and types of substances that may be discharged or emitted into the environment, (iv) limit or prohibit construction or timbering activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species, (v) govern worker health and safety aspects of operations, (vi) require measures to investigate, mitigate or remediate releases of hazardous or other substances from our operations and (vii) impose substantial liabilities, including possible fines and penalties for unpermitted emissions or discharges from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. 
         Moreover, the trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly stringent and broader requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several, strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party. Although we believe that our competitors will face similar environmental requirements, other market factors may prevent us from passing on any increased costs to our customers. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that the current level of regulation will continue in the future. 
         The following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business operations and with which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
   Air Emissions 
         The Clean Air Act, as amended ("CAA"), and state and local laws and regulations that implement and add to CAA requirements, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA 
 17

  imposes significant monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has the potential to delay the opening of new plants or the significant expansion of existing plants. 
         The CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future. 
   Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases 
         In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other gases, referred to as greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA") has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and certain stationary sources. In August 2015, U.S. EPA also issued its final rules to reduce GHG pollution from existing and new power plants ("CPP"). Although the CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court while legal challenges are pending and there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the CPP, some states currently are evaluating if and how to continue with the development of their implementation plans. Although the CPP, if implemented, would permit states to develop programs to incorporate the use of biomass energy in their compliance plans, there remains uncertainty regarding the treatment of biomass under the rule and costs to implement the rule, should it ever go into effect. Additionally, any other legislation or regulations that require permitting or reporting of GHG emissions or limit such emissions from our equipment and operations or from biomass-fired power plants operated by our customers, could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, or negatively impact the demand for wood pellets. We also note that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Water Discharges 
         The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended ("Clean Water Act"), as well as state laws and regulations that implement, and may be more stringent than, the Clean Water Act, restrict the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants must be performed in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by U.S. EPA or the implementing state agency. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. These permits generally have a term of five years. Although our facilities are presently in compliance with these requirements, changes to the terms and conditions of our permits in future renewals or new or modified regulations could require us to incur additional capital or operating expenditures which may be material. 
         Pursuant to the Clean Water Act, U.S. EPA has adopted the Discharge of Oil Regulation, which requires any person in charge of an onshore facility to report any discharge of a harmful quantity of oil into U.S. navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or the contiguous zone. A harmful quantity is any quantity of discharged oil that violates state water quality standards, causes a film or sheen on the water's surface or leaves sludge or emulsion beneath the surface. Spills from our production plants that are located along waterways or from our deep-water marine terminal facilities may result in fines, penalties and obligations to respond to and remediate any such spills. 
 18


  Spill Response and Release Reporting 
         Certain of our facilities are subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment located at these facilities and provide training to employees on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control laws. At these facilities, we have developed or will develop Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plans to memorialize these preparations and response plans and will update them on a regular basis. From time to time, these requirements may be made more stringent and may require us to modify our operations or expand our plans accordingly. The costs of implementing any such modifications or expansion may be significant. In addition, in the event of a spill or release, we may incur fines or penalties or incur responsibility for damage to natural resources, private property or personal injury in addition to obligations to respond to and remediate any such spill or release. 
 Endangered Species Act 
         The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended ("ESA"), restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Although some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 9, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA over the next six years, through the agency's 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on the availability or price of raw materials. 
 Coastal Area Protection and Wetlands and Navigable Waters Activity Regulations 
         Our Chesapeake terminal is a deep-water marine terminal facility. As a result, it is subject to the various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. At the federal level, the Coastal Zone Management Act ("CZMA") was enacted to preserve, protect, develop and, where possible, restore or enhance valuable natural coastal resources of the U.S. coastal zone. The CZMA authorizes and provides grants for state management programs to regulate land and water use and coastal development. 
         In Virginia, the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program ("Virginia CZM Program") administers the CZMA as established through Executive Order 18 (2010). A network of state agencies and local governments administer the Virginia CZM Program with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality serving as the lead agency. The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Designation and Management Regulations provide specific regulations regarding the protection and improvement of water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and establish criteria for local governments in granting, denying or modifying zoning and development requests in certain areas. The City of Chesapeake has passed an ordinance creating the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area District and adopting regulations for development within that district. 
         In addition to the CZMA, the Clean Water Act may result in federal or state regulators imposing conditions or restrictions on our operations or construction activities. For instance, the dredge and fill provisions of the Clean Water Act require a permit to conduct construction activities in protected waters and wetlands and prohibit unpermitted discharges of fill materials. Likewise, Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act also requires permits for the construction of certain port structures. We believe that we are in material compliance with these various requirements. However, any delays in obtaining future permits or renewals, or the inclusion of restrictive conditions in such permits, could adversely affect the cost of, or result in delays in, our operations and any future construction. 
 19

    Safety and Maintenance 
         We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. We have a corporate health and safety program that governs the way we conduct our operations at our facilities. Our employees receive OSHA training that is appropriate in light of the tasks performed at our facilities and general training on our health and safety plans. Compliance with OSHA and general training is mandatory. We perform preventive and routine maintenance on all of our manufacturing and deep-water marine terminaling systems, and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with applicable regulations. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standards in the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. Our facilities adhere to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards for combustible dust and incorporate pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to minimize regulated emissions. Our deep-water marine terminaling facilities adhere to Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding physical security and emergency response plans. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste and wastewater regulations. Notwithstanding these preventative measures, we cannot guarantee that serious accidents will not occur in the future. 
 Seasonality 
         Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because the delivered cost of fiber typically increases with wet weather and our raw materials have, on average, higher moisture content during this period of the year, resulting in a lower product yield. In addition, lower ambient temperatures increase the cost of drying wood fiber. 
 Principal Executive Offices 
         We lease office space for our principal executive offices at 7200 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1000, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. The lease expires in June 2024.
