We believe our brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and will allow us to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36 billion in 2019 by Jon Peddie Research. We intend to continue to grow by offering market-leading gear to gamers and content creators, expanding the breadth of our product suite to meet the needs of our customers, growing our worldwide market share, continuing to invest in marketing, product innovation and sales, and selectively pursuing accretive acquisitions.
 We leverage our scale and operational expertise to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into our portfolio, completing six acquisitions since 2018. The 2018 acquisition of Elgato allowed us to enter the streaming gear market, the 2019 acquisition of Origin PC allowed us to offer custom-built gaming PCs, and the 2019 acquisition of SCUF Gaming allowed us to enter the console gear market with a leading brand of controllers. In 2020, we acquired EpocCam to enhance the Elgato streaming camera software offering, and Gamer Sensei to offer gaming coaching services to the wide audience of gamers looking to improve their skills. In February 2021, we acquired Visuals by Impulse to provide creative services to streamers looking to professionalize the look of their broadcast.
 Our Industry
 
Since traditional arcade games of the 1970s, gaming has evolved into the mainstream and taken a central place in the global entertainment landscape. There were an estimated 2.8 billion gamers worldwide across all devices spending more than $174 billion on games in 2020, an amount which has grown at a 12.2% compound annual growth rate over the last two years, according to Newzoo. According to Activate Research, gaming today represents approximately 11% of all American consumer internet and media activity, surpassing activities such as social media and messaging.
 
There are a number of drivers we believe will continue to fuel the gaming market’s expansion. Technology continues to improve game quality. There is increasing availability and variety of high quality, interactive game content as game publishers use cutting-edge game development engines to rapidly create graphically sophisticated and engaging virtual worlds, many of which can support massive multiplayer experiences. Audiences are progressively engaging more with gaming content across platforms, with 71% of millennial gamers in the United States watching gaming video content on platforms like YouTube and Twitch for an average of almost six hours per week, according to a 2019 survey by Nielsen. Finally, there are decreasing barriers to gaming, where according to Newzoo, in 2020, there were 2.6 billion gamers using mobile devices, and the console and PC platforms represent a natural upgrade path for those seeking a more immersive or competitive gaming environment. 
 
In parallel, digital content creation today has democratized, with content sharing, video-first communication and voice-chat being the norm among creators, viewers and gamers. Gaming content creation and streaming is now ubiquitous, with over 40 million active gaming channels on YouTube in 2020 and over 27 billion live streaming hours watched across Twitch, Mixer, YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming in 2020. The proliferation of gaming content is attracting new gamers and increasing the performance focus of existing gamers. Beyond success in gaming, applications for streaming gear are proliferating across use cases including podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, among others. While emerging, these applications represent a promising avenue for continued expansion of the streaming gear market opportunity. 
 
We believe that the growth in gaming and streaming has enhanced demand for our gear by inspiring gamers and creators to reach for the next level of performance and content quality. Competitive gaming rewards speed, precision and reliability. As in other sports, specialized high-performance gear such as gaming mice, keyboards, headsets and performance controllers allow digital athletes to perform at their best. Modern games also require significant processing power to render high-resolution graphics, and reward the speed and precision of user inputs, driving demand for powerful gaming components and systems. Further, in a world where the ability to create content is democratized and competition for viewer engagement is greater than ever, content creators, particularly streamers, are increasingly seeking ways to maximize the quality of their video capture and broadcasting, which requires specialized high-performance gear.
 
Competitive gamer performance needs are being met with specialized gear, such as ultra-precise optical sensors in gaming mice, very low actuation distances in gaming keyboard switches, customizable rear paddles on performance controllers, liquid cooling solutions for high-performance processors and overclocked DRAM modules to process graphically complex games. Similarly, the broadcast quality expected of streamers has increased significantly and a traditional webcam does not produce the professional quality audiences expect of content. Dedicated capture cards are required to record and broadcast video at high resolution, high fidelity microphones are required to ensure clear sound quality, studio lighting and green screens improve production quality, and dedicated software is required to integrate gear and optimize the streaming experience, preventing lag and fidelity loss. Further, gamers striving for peak performance have heightened requirements for ergonomics and durability, and gamers and streamers often wish to express their personal style or brand with their choice of gear, including a range of appealing design options and opportunities for customization. Finally, gear integration has become an important feature, where gamers and streamers need all of their gear to 
 3


integrate harmoniously and need the ability to fine-tune that gear, which we believe is an experience best delivered with a software platform that seamlessly integrates and unifies control across devices. Our two proprietary software ecosystems cover the broadest range of gaming peripherals, components and streaming gear and are unmatched by anything else in the market.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
The global gaming PC and streaming gear markets, including peripherals, components and prebuilt PCs and laptops specifically designed for PC gaming, totaled approximately $36 billion in 2019, according to Jon Peddie Research. 
 
In 2019, there were an estimated 524 million PC gamers worldwide, comprising committed, competitive and casual PC gamers. Approximately 94 million of these gamers spent over $1,000 on their gaming PC systems. These gamers, comprising committed and competitive PC gamers, represented approximately $30 billion of the global gaming PC gear market. Further, approximately 27 million of these gamers, comprising committed PC gamers, spent over $1,800 on their gaming PC systems, representing $18 billion of the global gaming PC gear market. Globally, committed, competitive and casual gamers are estimated to have each spent on average $651, $179 and $14, respectively, on gaming PC gear in 2019. 51% of the PC gaming market comprises of machines in the $1,800+ category. The United States is a major market for PC Gaming, with an estimated 145 million PC gamers in 2020, according to Newzoo.
 
Our gaming components products are targeted at consumers who build their own PCs. According to DFC Intelligence, these “DIY” PC gamers spent $953 on average in 2019, representing 46% of global spending on gaming PCs, and this market has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate from 2012 to 2019. 
 
There were an estimated 825 million console gamers globally in 2020, according to Newzoo, driving demand for gaming console gear including controllers and console headsets. In addition, there were over 40 million active gaming channels on YouTube alone in 2020 and millions more active streamers across Twitch, Facebook Gaming, Huya and DouYu, driving purchases of dedicated content creation and streaming gear.
 
As gaming and streaming continue to expand in the mainstream, casual gamers increasingly aspire to emulate committed gamers and amateur streamers increasingly seek to improve their production quality. We expect this will bring new customers into the gaming and streaming gear market and push existing customers to improve their performance and content quality, in part through related gear spending.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated software-driven ecosystem. Since our inception, we have concentrated our efforts on helping gamers succeed, which has led us to develop what we believe to be the most complete ecosystem of high-performance gaming gear in the market, which is connected through our iCUE software. We have applied the same ethos to our product development for streaming gear, developing a suite of streaming software under our Elgato brand that help streamers optimize their gear and maximize content quality.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global sales and distribution network. As a global company, we have developed a comprehensive worldwide marketing and distribution network. In this network, we have established a multichannel sales model and have long-standing relationships with key distributors and retailers globally, as well as direct-to-consumer sales channels. We currently ship to more than 75 countries across six continents, with our gear being sold at leading retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, JD.com, MediaMarkt and Walmart. In 2020, sales to the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific represented 45.5%, 36.7% and 17.8%, respectively, of net revenue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management team of visionary leaders with deep industry experience and proven ability to execute. We have a strong management team of experienced and talented executives with a track record of execution and deep industry knowledge.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to grow our business by increasing value to our customers, expanding our market opportunity and further differentiating ourselves from competitors. Key components of our strategy include:

• | Advance as the global leader in high-performance gaming and streaming gear. The gaming and streaming gear category is benefiting from the growing popularity of competitive gaming and streaming, which are driving an increase in gaming and streaming participants as well as spend per participant on high-performance gear. We believe our brand name, high-performance gear and market position will allow us to capture a large share of this market growth and we intend to continue to make significant marketing investments in leading streamers, social media influencers and eSports teams.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to develop innovative, market-leading gaming and streaming gear. We intend to prioritize investment in creating innovative gaming and streaming gear and related software to enhance the customer experience by delivering cutting-edge technology. We have an exceptional engineering team, with approximately 25% of employees and contractors working on software solutions. We believe this strong bench of engineering expertise has helped us introduce 40 different products to the market across our categories in 2020, 36 in 2019 and 33 in 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into new gear and services that grow our market opportunity. Since our inception, we have successfully entered a number of new gear categories, including gaming PC peripherals, streaming accessories, console controllers, and prebuilt and gaming PCs and laptops. As the gaming and content creation landscape continues to evolve, we intend to continue to introduce new products and services to address our customers’ new and changing needs, and to grow our market opportunity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers. Our software platforms integrate and enhance our ecosystem of gaming and streaming gear, which drives customer loyalty and allows us to successfully sell additional gear to existing customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales. Through our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF in 2019, we acquired two companies whose sales are primarily generated through direct-to-consumer channels. Our acquisitions of Gamer Sensei in 2020 and Visuals by Impulse in January 2021, both of which have recurring service revenue streams, engage directly with our customer base across our brands. While sales from this channel are a relatively small contributor to our revenue today, we believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continue to grow market share globally. As a globally recognized brand, we have a footprint that reaches customers in more than 75 countries. We will continue to invest in enhancing our sales and distribution infrastructure to expand our leadership position in the Americas and Europe. In the gaming peripherals market, we have increased our U.S. market share from 5.0% in December 2013 to 15.5% in December 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis, according to NPD Group. We are a clear market leader in the gaming PC components market. According to NPD Group, we have increased our U.S. market share from 26.2% in December 2015 to 40.7% in December 2020 on a trailing twelve month basis. Additionally, for the twelve months ended December 2020, we had number two U.S. market share in gaming computer cases with an 18% market share, and number one U.S. market share in cooling solutions with a 48% market share, PSUs with a 37% market share and high-performance memory with a 55% market share. We view the Asia Pacific region as a long-term growth opportunity and recently invested in our local sales force and regional management to build out distributor networks and retail partnerships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our brand, software integration and superior product quality to support a pricing premium in the gaming PC components category. In the gaming PC components category, our revenue and margins have benefited from higher pricing versus the rest of the market, which we expect to continue as we invest in our brand and product portfolio. Compared to the average non-Corsair product, our computer cases, cooling solutions, PSUs and high-performance memory commanded price premiums of 29%, 54%, 31% and 4%, respectively, in the United States for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, according to NPD data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue complementary acquisitions. We plan to evaluate, and may pursue acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Elgato, Origin, SCUF, EpocCam, Gamer Sensei and Visuals by Impulse, which we believe strengthen our capabilities in existing segments as well as diversify our product offerings, broaden our end-user base or expand our geographic presence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solutions
 We design our high-performance gear to address the needs of gamers and content creators. To help our customers perform at their peak, whether in game or on camera, we have developed the industry’s most complete integrated ecosystem of gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems. We have a diversified product portfolio, with 25 primary product lines.

• | Gamer and creator peripherals. Our gamer and creator peripherals seek to provide the fastest, highest fidelity, and most seamless interface between digital athletes and their game, and content creators and their viewers. Our solutions include our high-performance gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, and our streaming gear including capture cards, Stream Decks, USB microphones, studio accessories, and EpocCam software, as well as coaching and training services, among others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gaming components and systems. We develop and sell high-performance gaming components to help gamers build their own custom gaming PCs. We also develop and sell complete high-performance gaming systems using our gaming components. Our prebuilt systems and user-built systems are designed to deliver maximum performance, all the while providing our customers the design aesthetic and customizability they demand. Our solutions include our high-performance power supply units, or PSUs, cooling solutions, computer cases, DRAM modules, as well as high-end prebuilt and custom-built gaming PCs, among others.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PC Gaming Software. Our product offering is enhanced by our two proprietary software platforms: iCUE for gamers and Elgato’s streaming suite for content creators. These software platforms provide unified, intuitive performance, and aesthetic control and customization across their respective product families.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our iCUE software platform powers the full range of our gear from a single intuitive interface, providing advanced performance tuning, user customization and system monitoring. By enabling our customers to fine tune the response of our gaming gear to maximize performance and match their personal preferences and styles of play, we believe that iCUE provides a distinct competitive advantage.
 
 Product Development
 Our product development efforts focus on broadening our portfolio with innovative, value-added products that provide gamers with more immersive experiences. This process begins with the initial market analysis and product definition phase, where we use deep knowledge of consumer preferences and feedback to decide the exact specifications of new products desired by our end-users. 
 7


We then leverage third-party manufacturers and, in some cases, engineering and design firms to help us design, prototype and fabricate our products. We select these third-party partners through a comprehensive selection process and subject them to rigorous quality controls. We perform extensive in-house testing of our products with the latest CPUs and GPUs to ensure optimal performance and compatibility of our products with the most advanced hardware. Our rigorous product development and testing is designed to give us the ability to meet the needs of our end-users consistently with well-designed, high-performance and reliable products.
 Marketing
 Our marketing efforts are designed to enhance the Corsair, Elgato, Origin and SCUF brand names, to help us acquire new customers and to increase sales from our existing customers. We have structured our marketing organization to achieve both product- and geography-specific coverage. In addition, our marketing personnel regularly meets with other key industry suppliers such as Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and Asus, in order to ensure that our product development efforts appropriately address the needs of their new products and also to discuss trends and changes in the computer technology market.
 We build awareness of our products and brand through advertising campaigns, public relations efforts, marketing development funds and other financial incentives provided to retailers to promote our products, end-user rebates, online social media outreach, online and in-store promotions and merchandising, our website and other efforts. We believe that our products and brand have also benefited from social media influencers, customer referrals and positive product reviews. We also invest in sponsorships and partnerships with eSports events, leagues teams and streaming influencers.
 We benefit from an active computer gaming community whose members communicate with each other through various online social media such as forums, blogs and social networks, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In addition to forums hosted by third-party domains, we host Corsair-branded forums that are accessible via our website. We actively participate in this community, enabling us to communicate directly with our end customers. Finally, we regularly publish technical and editorial content through various online and print channels and participate in industry trade shows, gaming competitions and other consumer-facing events that provide us with the opportunity to demonstrate our products.
 Sales and Distribution
 Our gear is purchased by gaming enthusiasts worldwide through either our e-tail and retail channel or our direct-to-consumer channel. In our e-tail and retail channel, we distribute our gear either directly to our reseller or through key distributors. While we historically have sold our gear directly to consumers through our website, following our acquisitions of Origin and SCUF Gaming in 2019, the volume of direct-to-consumer sales has increased as both of these companies primarily generated sales through direct-to-consumer channels. We believe direct-to-consumer sales represent a significant avenue to drive growth by facilitating increased market penetration across our product categories.
 We have divided our sales organization into four major regions—Europe (including the Middle East and North Africa), North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific (including South Africa)—and we have local language-speaking sales representatives in the countries that, in the aggregate, generate the majority of our net revenue. We ship our products directly to approximately 50 retailers and over 160 distributors and, through distributors, supply our products to thousands of smaller online and brick-and-mortar retailers.
 Our direct sales force supports leading online retailers, including Amazon and Newegg in North America; Amazon, Komplett, Mindfactory, LDLC and Scan in Europe; and JD, Tmall, Amazon and PC Case Gear in the Asia Pacific region. We also have sales relationships with leading brick-and-mortar retailers, including Best Buy and Micro Center in North America and Mediamarkt, Boulanger, Elkjop, Fnac and Dixons in Europe. A small portion of our net revenue is from sales directly to original equipment manufacturers that manufacture gaming PCs. Our distributors sell our products primarily to online and brick-and-mortar retailers and to specialist and gaming system integrators and value-added resellers. Our major distributors are Ingram Micro and D&H in North America; S&K, Exertis and Littlebit in Europe; and Synnex Australia, Leader, ASK and Links in the Asia Pacific region.
 In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Amazon accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, at 24.6%, 25.1% and 22.4%, respectively.
 Production and Operations
 We believe we have developed a global, scalable production and operations infrastructure that allows us to deliver our products cost-effectively and in a timely manner. We operate a facility in Taiwan where we assemble, test, package and ultimately supply nearly all of our DRAM modules and a significant portion of our liquid cooling products and prebuilt gaming systems. We also assemble, test, package and ultimately supply our custom-built PCs in our U.S. facility, and our customized gaming controllers in our U.S. and U.K. facilities. All of the other gear we sell is produced at factories operated by third parties located in China, Taiwan and 
 8


countries in Southeast Asia. In some regions, we also outsource storage and shipping to third-party logistics providers around the world.
 Production of most of our high-speed DRAM modules involves testing and speed sorting of both DRAM ICs and modules and retail packing in our facility in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Our ability to test and sort DRAM modules efficiently enables us to grade them and offer high-performance DRAM modules at higher price points. For standard speed DRAM modules, we also procure assembled modules from approved subcontractors and then test and package them in our Taiwan facility.
 In addition to our production capabilities, our corporate planning process places particular emphasis on driving efficiencies in demand forecasting, supply chain planning, procurement cycle time, freight costs and inventory management. Our goal of limiting the time DRAM modules are held in our inventory to a few weeks helps mitigate any impact that this volatility may have on our gross margins. Furthermore, given the products we sell and the global nature of our business, freight costs can have a significant impact on our expenses. Because of this, we have developed a sophisticated forecasting and planning process designed to reduce the cost of transporting our products to our regional distribution hubs and finally, to our customers.
 Backlog
 Sales of our products are generally made pursuant to purchase orders and customers typically do not enter into long-term purchase agreements or commitments with us. Customer purchase orders typically call for product shipment within a few weeks, except for DRAM modules orders that are typically requested in a few days. Consequently, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is material or a reliable indicator of sales for any future period.
Seasonality
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in sales due to the buying patterns of our customers and the spending patterns of gamers. Our net revenue has generally been lower in the first and second calendar quarters due to lower consumer demand following the fourth quarter holiday season and because of the decline in sales that typically occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new or enhanced CPUs and GPUs, which usually take place in the second calendar quarter and which tend to drive sales in the following two quarters. Further, our net revenue tends to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarter due to seasonal sales such as “Black Friday,” “Cyber Monday” and “Singles Day” in China, as retailers tend to make purchases in advance of these sales. Our sales also tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the introduction of new consoles and high-profile games in connection with the holiday season. As a consequence of seasonality, our net revenue for the second calendar quarter is generally the lowest of the year followed by the first calendar quarter. We expect these seasonality trends to continue.
Competition
 We face intense competition in the markets for all of our products. We operate in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, constant price pressure, rapid product obsolescence, evolving industry standards and new demands for features and performance. We experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities by competitors, including in response to declines in consumer demand and excess product supply or as competitors seek to gain market share.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors that affect customer preferences include brand awareness, reputation, breadth and depth of product offering, product performance and quality, design and aesthetics, price, user experience, online product reviews and other value propositions. We believe we compete favorably based on these factors.
 In recent years, we have added new product categories and we intend to introduce new product categories in the future. To the extent we are successful in adding new product categories, we will confront new competitors, many of which may have more experience, better known brands and greater distribution capabilities in the new product categories and markets than we do. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies. Many of our current and potential competitors, some of which are large, multi-national businesses, have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, personnel and other resources and greater brand recognition than we have. Our competitors may be in a strong position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market, and sell their products more effectively than we can. In addition, some of our competitors are small or mid-sized specialty companies, which may enable them to react to changes in industry trends or consumer preferences or to introduce new or innovative products more quickly than we can. As a result, our product development efforts may not be successful or result in market acceptance of our products.

Our ability to compete successfully is fundamental to our success in existing and new markets. If we do not compete effectively, demand for our products could decline, our net revenues and gross margin could decrease and we could lose market share, which could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Intellectual Property
 We consider the Corsair brand to be among our most valuable assets. We also consider the Elgato, Origin, and SCUF brands; proprietary technology brands such as iCUE and Slipstream; and major product family brands such as Corsair ONE, Dark Core, Dominator, Glaive, Harpoon, Ironclaw, K70, Nightsword, Scimitar, Vengeance, and Void to be important to our business. Our future success depends to a large degree upon our ability to defend the Corsair brand and its associated sub-brands from infringement and, to a limited extent, to protect our other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions such as non-disclosure terms to protect our intellectual property.
 
As of January 14, 2021, our patent portfolio consisted of 331 patents, for which we had 238 patents registrations globally, including utility, invention, utility model and design patents, and 93 pending applications globally. As of December 31, 2020, our trademark portfolio consisted of 495 trademarks, for which we had 471 registrations globally including the European Union and with the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO, and 24 pending applications for registrations globally including the European Union and with the WIPO. 
 The expansion of our business has required us to protect our trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and patents and, to the extent that we expand our business into new geographic areas, we may be required to protect our trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and sometimes requires litigation. If we are unable to protect our trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights, or prevent third parties from infringing upon them, our business may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our future success depends to a large degree upon our ability to defend the Corsair brand and product family brands such as SCUF, Vengeance, K70, Elgato and iCUE from infringement and, if we are unable to protect our brand and other intellectual property, our business may be seriously harmed.” We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions such as non-disclosure terms to protect our intellectual property. Companies in the technology industry are frequently subject to litigation or disputes based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We are, have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages or royalties and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.”
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 2,411 employees, including temporary employees and dedicated sales and software developer contractors. None of our employees is currently represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to his or her employment. To date we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
