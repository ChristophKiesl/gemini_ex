ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “Battalion,” “our,” “us,” and “we” refer to Battalion Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries, as a common entity. Battalion is the successor reporting company to Halcón Resources Corporation (Halcón). On January 21, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect a change of our corporate name from Halcón Resources Corporation to Battalion Oil Corporation. 
Certain prior year financial statements are not comparable to our current year financial statements due to the adoption of fresh-start accounting upon our emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 8, 2019. References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to October 1, 2019, the convenience date applied for fresh-start accounting. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, October 1, 2019. Refer to Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2, “Reorganization” and Note 3, “Fresh-start Accounting,” for further details. 
We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore liquids-rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. During 2017 (Predecessor), we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin and divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and in the El Halcón area of East Texas. As a result, our properties and drilling activities are currently focused in the Delaware Basin, where we have an extensive drilling inventory that we believe offers attractive long-term economics.
At December 31, 2020 (Successor), our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (Netherland, Sewell) using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prices for crude oil and natural gas, which are based on preceding 12-month first day of the month average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price of $39.54 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $1.99 per MMBtu, were approximately 63.4 MMBoe, consisting of 38.2 MMBbls of oil, 12.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 78.5 Bcf of natural gas. Approximately 57% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed as of December 31, 2020 (Successor). We maintain operational control of 99.9% of our estimated proved reserves.
Our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor) were approximately $148.3 million, compared to total operating revenues for the period of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor) and the period of January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor) of approximately $65.6 million and $159.1 million, respectively, or $224.7 million combined. Full year 2020 (Successor) production averaged 16,858 Boe/d. During the period of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor) and the period of January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor), production averaged 20,293 Boe/d and 17,209 Boe/d, respectively, or 17,986 Boe/d combined. The decrease in total operating revenues and average daily production year over year was driven by our temporary shut-in of a portion of producing wells across all our operating areas in May and June 2020 as a consequence of low oil prices as well as average realized prices that were lower by approximately $10.25 per Boe. The estimated production decrease associated with these temporary shut-ins was approximately 1,300 Boe/d for 2020 (Successor). In December 2020 (Successor), we divested properties that produced approximately 600 Boe/d during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (Successor). In 2020 (Successor), we drilled and cased 4.0 gross (4.0 net) operated wells, completed 5.0 gross (4.3 net) operated wells, and put online 7.0 gross (6.3 net) operated wells.

Recent Developments
Risk and Uncertainties
We are continuously monitoring the current and potential impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our business, including how it has and may continue to impact our operations, financial results, liquidity, contractors, customers, employees and vendors, and taking appropriate actions in response, including reducing capital expenditures, temporarily shutting-in producing wells, and implementing various measures to ensure the continued operation of our business in a safe and secure manner. COVID-19 and governmental actions to contain the pandemic have contributed to an economic downturn, reduced demand for oil and natural gas and, together with a price war between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)/Saudi Arabia and Russia, depressed oil and natural gas prices to historically low levels. Although OPEC and Russia subsequently agreed to reduce production, downward pressure on prices has continued and could continue for the foreseeable future, particularly given concerns over the impacts of the current economic downturn on demand. We are unable to predict the ongoing effects that these events will have on our business and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and the impacts that governmental or other actions taken to limit the extent and duration of the outbreak, in conjunction with economic conditions, will have on our business, demand for oil and natural gas, and oil and natural gas prices. The health of our employees, contractors and vendors, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our operations and critical functions cannot be predicted, nor can the impact on our customers, vendors and contractors. Any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. These and other factors could affect the Company’s operations, earnings and cash flows and could cause our results to not be comparable to those of the same period in previous years. For example, we realized lower revenue as a result of commodity price declines, which began in March 2020 (Successor). In response to low commodity prices, we temporarily shut-in producing wells in May and June 2020 (Successor), which further contributed to lower revenues in the current year. Additionally, we incurred ceiling test impairments, which were primarily driven by a decline in the average pricing used in the valuation of our reserves. The results presented in this Form 10-K are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. For further information regarding the actual and potential impacts of COVID-19 on us, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Northern West Quito Assets Divestiture
​
On December 18, 2020 (Successor), we sold certain oil and gas properties and related assets located in Ward County, Texas (the North West Quito Assets) to Point Energy Partners Operating, LLC for a total sales price of $26.3 million in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments as provided in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The effective date of the transaction was October 1, 2020 (Successor). Proceeds from the sale were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our full cost pool with no gain or loss recorded. We used the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. Estimated proved reserves associated with the North West Quito Assets were approximately 2 MMBoe, or approximately 3% of our year-end 2019 proved reserves. The North West Quito Assets generated net production of approximately 600 Boe/d, or approximately 4% of our average daily production for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (Successor).
​
Successor Senior Revolving Credit Facility
On October 29, 2020 (Successor), we entered into the Third Amendment to Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the Third Amendment). The Third Amendment, among other things, set the borrowing base to $190.0 million as of November 1, 2020, which eliminated the final monthly reduction of $5.0 million required under the Second Amendment (discussed below). The Third Amendment also reduced the amount available for issuance of letters of credit to $25.0 million and amended certain covenants including, but not limited to, covenants relating to increasing the minimum mortgaged total value of proved borrowing base properties from 85% to 90%. Additionally, the Third Amendment provided for new covenants that, among other things, require us to enter into swap agreements representing not less than 65% of our reasonably anticipated projected production from proved reserves classified as developed producing reserves for a period from the Third Amendment effective date through at least December 31, 2022 and prohibit no more than $3.0 million of our uncontested accounts payable or accrued expenses, liabilities or other obligations from remaining outstanding for longer than 90 days. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the administrative agent and the lenders consented to a waiver of the Current Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the 

9




fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 and suspended testing of the Current Ratio until the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021.
​
On July 31, 2020 (Successor), we entered into the Limited Waiver to Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement in which, the lenders consented to waive maintenance of a Current Ratio (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020. Our failure to comply with the Current Ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2020 (Successor) was primarily the result of our decision to shut in certain production due to low oil prices coupled with capital spending required to maintain certain of our oil and gas leasehold interests.
​
On April 30, 2020 (Successor), we entered into the Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (Second Amendment) which, among other things, (i) reduced the borrowing base to $200.0 million effective from April 30, 2020, which was then reduced by $5.0 million monthly starting September 1, 2020 until November 1, 2020, so that the borrowing base was scheduled to be $185.0 million on November 1, 2020, provided the borrowing base redetermination scheduled for November 1, 2020 occurred pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement, (ii) increased interest margins to 1.50% to 2.50% for ABR-based loans and 2.50% to 3.50% for Eurodollar-based loans, (iii) provided that should our Consolidated Cash Balance (as defined pursuant to the Second Amendment) exceed $10.0 million, such amounts shall be used to prepay any borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement and thereafter, to the extent of any uncollateralized letters of credit exposure, shall be cash collateralized in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement and (iv) allowed for a replacement benchmark rate to the London Interbank Offered Rate (which may include SOFR, Compounded SOFR or Term SOFR). The Second Amendment also added provisions related to a loan incurred by us under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). We used, and the Second Amendment required us to use, the loan proceeds for CARES Forgivable Uses under the CARES Act. Additionally, the Second Amendment waived, for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2020, that we comply with the requirement under the Senior Credit Agreement that we unwind certain swap agreements for which settlement payments were calculated in such fiscal quarter to exceed 100% of actual production.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
On April 16, 2020 (Successor), we entered into a promissory note (the PPP Loan) for a principal amount of approximately $2.2 million from Bank of Montreal under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act, which is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Pursuant to the terms of the CARES Act, the proceeds of the PPP Loan may be used for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent or utility costs. The PPP Loan bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum and, if not forgiven, has a maturity date of April 16, 2022. As long as we make a timely application of forgiveness to the SBA, we are not required to make any payments under the PPP Loan until the forgiveness amount is communicated to us by the SBA. 
Under the terms of the CARES Act, we can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP Loan. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act during the covered period after loan origination and the maintenance or achievement of certain employee levels. We believe we are eligible for, and intend to pursue, forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the requirements and limitations under the CARES Act; however, no assurance can be provided that forgiveness of any portion of the PPP Loan will be obtained. 
Acid Gas Injection Well Permits
​
During the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), we received permits from the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to construct and operate an acid gas injection well (AGI) by converting an existing producing gas well. AGI can provide a more cost effective alternative to sour gas treating. We are currently evaluating options for development of an AGI facility, including, but not limited to, divestiture of the assets with an associated third party treating arrangement for our sour gas production.

Listing of our Common Stock on NYSE American
Our Predecessor common stock was previously listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “HK.” As a result of our failure to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, on July 22, 2019, our Predecessor common stock was delisted from the NYSE. Effective February 20, 2020, we commenced trading on the NYSE American exchange under the symbol “BATL.”
2021 Capital Budget
We expect to spend approximately $40.0 million to $50.0 million on capital expenditures during 2021. Overall, we currently plan to drill two gross operated wells during the year, complete six gross operated wells, and bring six gross operated wells on production. Our 2021 capital budget currently contemplates running one operated rig in the Delaware Basin at the beginning of the year. We continuously monitor changes in market conditions and adapt our operational plans as necessary in order to maintain financial flexibility, preserve core acreage and meet contractual obligations, and therefore our capital budget is subject to change.
We expect to fund our budgeted 2021 capital expenditures with cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated or our costs are materially greater than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail drilling, development, land acquisitions and other activities to reduce our capital spending.
Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, transportation take-away capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success.
Business Strategy
Our primary long-term objective is to increase stockholder value by safely and cost-effectively increasing our production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, adding to our proved reserves and growing our inventory of economic drilling locations, while acting as a responsible corporate citizen in the areas in which we operate. To accomplish this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies:

● | Develop our Liquids-Rich Acreage Positions to Grow Production and Reserves Efficiently. We intend to drill and develop our multi-zone resource play to maximize value and resource potential. Our near-term development plans are focused on production growth and acreage preservation in our liquids-rich Monument Draw area. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance Returns Through Continued Improvements in Operational and Cost Efficiencies. We are the operator for the majority of our acreage, which gives us control over the timing of capital expenditures, execution and costs. It also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. As operator, we are able to evaluate industry drilling results and implement improved operating practices that may enhance our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital. In addition to operational efficiencies, we continue to implement cost-saving measures to reduce corporate administrative expenses. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Flexibility. Our management team is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we intend to achieve through conservative use of leverage and continued improvements on rates of return. We believe our internally-generated cash flows and borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current capital program and strategy. We have no material near-term debt maturities. We also employ a hedging program to reduce the variability of our cash flows used to support our capital spending. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11





● | Attain Growth Through Strategic Business Combinations. We intend to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities to meet our strategic and financial targets, including the maintenance of a conservative leverage position. Selective business combinations provide opportunities to acquire high quality assets complementary to our core acreage, expand our drilling inventory and gain operational scale. We believe our management team’s geologic and engineering expertise, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides a competitive advantage in the identification of acquisition targets and evaluation of resource potential.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The proved reserves estimates reported herein for the years ended December 31, 2020 (Successor), 2019 (Successor) and 2018 (Predecessor) have been independently evaluated by Netherland, Sewell, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. Netherland, Sewell was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within Netherland, Sewell, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the Netherland, Sewell reserves reports incorporated herein are Mr. Neil H. Little and Mr. Edward C. Roy III. Mr. Little, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 117966), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Netherland, Sewell since 2011 and has over nine years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from University of Houston in 2007 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Roy, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, Geology (No. 2364), has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at Netherland, Sewell since 2008 and has over 11 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Texas Christian University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology and from Texas A&M University in 1998 with a Master of Science Degree in Geology. Netherland, Sewell has reported to us that both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; they are both proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
Our board of directors has established a reserves committee composed of independent directors with experience in energy company reserve evaluations. Our independent engineering firm reports jointly to the reserves committee and to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The reserves committee is charged with ensuring the integrity of the process of selection and engagement of the independent engineering firm and in making a recommendation to our board of directors as to whether to approve the report prepared by our independent engineering firm. Mr. Daniel P. Rohling, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the annual reserve report by Netherland, Sewell. He has more than 14 years of oil and gas operations experience and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University and is an active member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
 The reserves information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. Reserve evaluation is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary significantly. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the preparation of such estimates by Netherland, Sewell and other information about our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—“Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited).”
Proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020 (Successor). Average prices for the 12-month period were as follows: WTI crude oil spot price of $39.54 per Bbl, adjusted by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and market 

12




differentials and a Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $1.99 per MMBtu, as adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines.
The following table presents certain proved reserve information as of December 31, 2020 (Successor).

Proved Reserves (MBoe)(1) | | ​ 
Developed | ​ | 36,232

Oil and Natural Gas Production
Core Resource Play—Delaware Basin
We have working interests in 41,676 net acres in the Delaware Basin as of December 31, 2020 (Successor) in Pecos, Reeves, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas. This core resource play is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content in thick, continuous sections of source rock that can provide repeatable drilling opportunities and significant initial production rates. Our primary targets in this area are the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. As of December 31, 2020 (Successor), we had 113 operated wells producing in this area in addition to minor working interests in 8 non-operated wells. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2020 (Successor) was 16,790 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2020 (Successor), estimated proved reserves for the Delaware Basin were approximately 63.3 MMBoe, of which approximately 57% were classified as proved developed and approximately 43% as proved undeveloped.
Risk Management
We have designed a risk management policy for the use of derivative instruments to provide partial protection against certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price declines and price differentials between the NYMEX commodity price and the index price at the location where our production is sold. Derivative contracts are utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. Our objective generally is to hedge 65-85% of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for up to 30 months. However, our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions, provided, however, that under our Senior Credit Agreement we are contractually obligated to hedge no less than 65% of our anticipated production under swap contracts through at least December 31, 2022. Our hedge policies and objectives change as our operational profile changes. Our future performance is subject to commodity price risks and our future cash flows from operations may be volatile. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes.

13




While there are many different types of derivatives available, we typically use fixed-price swap, costless collar, basis swap, and WTI NYMEX roll agreements to attempt to manage price risk. The fixed-price swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the fixed-price swap agreement. Costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement is below the floor. Basis swaps effectively lock in a price differential between regional prices (i.e. Midland) where the product is sold and the relevant pricing index under which the oil production is hedged (i.e. Cushing). WTI NYMEX roll agreements account for pricing adjustments to the trade month versus the delivery month for contract pricing.
It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. As of December 31, 2020 (Successor), we did not post collateral under any of our derivative contracts as they are secured under our Senior Credit Agreement. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10, “Derivative and Hedging Activities,” for additional information.
Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Our principal properties consist of leasehold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties and the reserves associated with these properties. Generally, our oil and natural gas leases remain in force as long as production in paying quantities is maintained. Leases on undeveloped oil and natural gas properties are typically for a primary term of three to five years within which we are generally required to develop the property or the lease will expire. In some cases, the primary term of leases on our undeveloped properties can be extended by option payments; the amount of any payments and time extended vary by lease. The table below sets forth the results of our drilling activities for the periods indicated:

Of the acreage with 2021 and 2022 expiration dates, approximately 450 and zero net acres, respectively, relate to our core area of operations. We continually review our near-term lease expirations to preserve acreage in our core area of operations, either through our drilling program or through lease extensions or renewals, if necessary. We have no current plans to drill on acreage in areas outside of our core area of operations.
At December 31, 2020 (Successor), we had estimated proved reserves of approximately 63.4 MMBoe comprised of 38.2 MMBbls of crude oil, 12.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 78.5 Bcf of natural gas. The following table sets forth these reserves:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------------------+---+-----------+---+-------------+---+-------
​ | ​ | Proved | ​ | Proved | ​ | Total 
​ | | Developed | | Undeveloped | | Proved
Oil (MBbls) | ​ | 20,371 | ​ | 17,845 | ​ | 38,216
Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) | ​ | 7,345 | ​ | 4,730 | ​ | 12,075
Natural Gas (MMcf) | ​ | 51,097 | ​ | 27,409 | ​ | 78,506

(1) | Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio is based on energy equivalency, not price equivalency. The price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is substantially lower than the price for a barrel of oil.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At December 31, 2020 (Successor), total estimated proved reserves were approximately 63.4 MMBoe, a 1.3 MMBoe net increase from the previous year’s estimate of 62.1 MMBoe. The net increase in total proved reserves was the result of additions and extensions of 12.4 MMBoe, partially offset by production of 6.2 MMBoe, sales of 2.0 MMBoe, and negative revisions of 2.9 MMBoe due primarily to decreases in SEC pricing. 
At December 31, 2020 (Successor), our estimated proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were approximately 27.1 MMBoe, a 3.0 MMBoe net increase from the previous year’s estimate of 24.1 MMBoe. The net increase in total PUD reserves was the result of additions and extensions of 12.4 MMBoe, partially offset by development of 6.5 MMBoe and negative revisions of 2.8 MMBoe due primarily to decreases in SEC pricing. 

15




As of December 31, 2020 (Successor), all of our PUD reserves are planned to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2020, approximately $43.3 million in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells.
Reliable technologies were used to determine areas where PUD locations are more than one offset location away from a producing well. These technologies include seismic data, wire line openhole log data, core data, log cross-sections, performance data, and statistical analysis. In such areas, these data demonstrated consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in addition to significant quantities of economic estimated ultimate recoveries from individual producing wells. We relied only on production flow tests and historical production data, along with the reliable geologic data mentioned above to estimate proved reserves. No other alternative methods or technologies were used to estimate proved reserves. Out of total PUD reserves of 27.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2020 (Successor), 13.7 MMBoe were associated with 15 gross PUD locations that were more than one offset location from a producing well.
The estimates of quantities of proved reserves contained in this report were made in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. For additional information on our oil and natural gas reserves, including a table detailing the changes by year of our proved reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—“Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited).” We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting in accordance with SEC regulations. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, treating equipment and gathering support facilities, dry holes, geophysical costs, direct internal costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves. The net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test. See further discussion in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7, “Oil and Natural Gas Properties.”
Capitalized costs of our evaluated and unevaluated properties at December 31, 2020 (Successor), 2019 (Successor) and 2018 (Predecessor) are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Competitive Conditions in the Business
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining sufficient availability of drilling and completion equipment and services, obtaining purchasers, transporters and take-away capacity for the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees. There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States and the states in which our properties are located. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.
Other Business Matters
Markets and Major Customers
The purchasers of our oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. In 2020 (Successor), two individual purchasers of our production, Western Refining Inc. and Sunoco Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 57% of our total sales for the year. For the combined periods of October 2, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (Successor), and January 1, 2019 through October 1, 2019 (Predecessor), two individual purchasers of our production, Western Refining Inc. and Sunoco Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 80% of our total sales for the period. In 2018 (Predecessor), two individual purchasers of our production, Western Refining Inc. and Sunoco, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 77% of our total sales for the year. 
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for crude oil can often be higher in the summer months during the peak travel season. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
Operational Risks
Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to be overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental releases of toxic or hazardous materials, such as hydrogen sulfide, petroleum liquids, or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion on risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

18




Regulations
All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed.
The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs may address various aspects of our business, including naturally occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies 

19




that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to reclassify oil and gas wastes as hazardous wastes or to subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general.
 In the ordinary course of our operations, moreover, we do handle materials that may be subject to extensive existing RCRA regulations or that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of those materials have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials.
Water Discharges
Our operations also may be subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state statutes. Those laws regulate discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters, we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for cleanup costs, damages and economic losses.
Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations promulgated under the SDWA, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our completion operations are subject to regulations that may become more stringent in either the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
Working at the direction of Congress, the EPA issued a study in 2016 finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA also promulgated pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Environmental groups have encouraged the EPA to supplement those requirements. Various members of Congress likewise have from time to time introduced bills that would result in more stringent control or outright bans of the hydraulic fracturing process. 

20




In addition, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. While the Trump Administration rescinded those rules, that decision is being challenged in court. Regardless of how the federal issues are eventually resolved, states have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions, such as Denton, Texas and several cities in Colorado, have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and may continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, air toxics, and methane. The rules included the first federal air standards for natural gas and oil wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Although the EPA later made technical amendments to reduce the regulatory burden of the 2012 and 2016 rules, compliance has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. 
In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation has been ongoing and has resulted in expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas could be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.
Climate Change
Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response, governments increasingly have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.
At the federal level, the Obama Administration took a variety of steps to address climate change. For example, the EPA issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA issued an “Endangerment Finding” under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step in issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities.
In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. 

21




Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued air rules for oil and gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. 
The Trump Administration tried to roll back many of the Obama-era climate change policies and rules. But shortly after his inauguration, President Biden accepted the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States, declared climate considerations an essential part of the United States’ foreign policy, issued a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands, and directed federal agencies to incorporate climate change considerations in their operations. Thus, new federal programs relating to climate change appear to be likely over at least the next four years.
Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.
The National Environmental Policy Act
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources
Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees.

We complied with the guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control or mandated by local authorities. We implemented work from home arrangements for our staff employees and additional safety measures for those continuing critical on-site work in the field including social distancing, masks, testing, self-reporting and procedures for those testing positive.

We offer market-competitive compensation programs, as well as strong health and welfare benefits along with a competitive 401(k) program. We have designed paid time off policies to allow our employees time off for family and other priorities. We have operational and financial metrics tied to our short-term incentives that align with our business strategy and the interests of our stockholders.

All Battalion employees must act in accordance with our Employee Handbook, which is inclusive of our Code of Conduct. The Employee Handbook covers various topics including, among others, policies prohibiting harassment, discrimination and retaliation and policies covering workplace anti-violence, cybersecurity, confidential information and conduct.
