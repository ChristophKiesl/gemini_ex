ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Overview
Resonant is a late-stage development company that has created an innovative software, intellectual property, or IP, and services platform that has the ability to increase designer efficiency, reduce the time to market and lower unit costs in the designs of filters for radio frequency, or RF, front-ends for the mobile device, automotive, medical, internet-of-things and related industries.  The RF front-end, or RFFE, is the circuitry in a device responsible for analog signal processing and is located between the device’s antenna and its digital circuitry.  The software platform we continue to develop is based on fundamentally new technology that we call WaveX™, to configure and connect resonators, the building blocks of RF filters.  Filters are a critical component of the RF front-end used to select desired radio frequency signals and reject unwanted signals.  Our WaveX™ platform allows us to develop unique, custom designs that address the increasing complexity of the RFFE due to increasing bandwidth requirements, such as by using carrier aggregation (the combining of multiple frequencies into a single data stream to increase throughput through higher data rates), or CA, by both reducing the size of the filter and improving performance.  Our goal is to utilize our WaveX™ platform to support our customers in reducing their time to develop complex filter and module designs, to access new classes of filter designs, and to do it more cost effectively. Additionally, our WaveX™ platform has allowed us to expand our customer focus beyond just filter manufacturers by enabling a new class of customer - fabless filter manufacturers. These companies do not have their own internal filter fabrication facility, or fab, and typically already would be supplying other products in the RFFE to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and, as a result do not require a protracted new vendor qualification process in order to supply parts. Through our existing customer relationships, we are able to leverage our WaveX™ tools to deliver cutting edge filter designs to these fabless filter manufacturers.
    We are commercializing our technology through the creation of filter designs that address the problems in the high growth RFFE industry created by the growing number of frequency bands in mobile and other RFFE enabled devices. The worldwide adoption of Long Term Evolution, or LTE, as the global standard, the transition to 5G, and the use of mobile devices to access the Internet, has resulted in massive proliferation of frequency bands which, when combined with CA for higher data rates and multiple input multiple output, or MIMO, has resulted in an ever-increasing number and complexity of filters in the RFFE. We have developed and continue to expand a series of single-band designs for frequency bands presently dominated by larger and more expensive bulk acoustic wave, or BAW, filters.  We are also developing multiplexer filter designs for two or more bands to address the CA requirements of our customers. We are using our WaveX™ platform to efficiently integrate these designs into RF modules for our module customers. Currently, we are leveraging WaveX™ to develop these designs targeted for either the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) or Temperature Compensated, Surface Acoustic Wave (TC-SAW) manufacturing processes. In 2018 we further extended WaveX™ for BAW designs, which has resulted in our invention of a resonator structure based on a combination of interdigital transducer (IDT) and piezoelectric membrane, which we call XBAR®, which exhibits performance parameters suitable for 5G, WiFi, and UltraWideband (UWB) applications - high frequency operation, large bandwidth and high power reliability. Our success with XBAR® is dependent on our ability to develop high frequency filters utilizing these resonator structures that are successfully adopted by our targeted customers, which will be determined by our ability to show improved performance over competing products or significantly reduce the size and cost of their products. 
    We believe licensing our designs, either as prepaid royalties or royalties paid as products ship, is the most direct and effective means of validating our WaveX™ platform and IP to address this rapidly growing market.  Our target customers make part or all of the RFFE.  We intend to retain ownership of our designs, and we expect to be compensated through license fees and royalties based on sales of RFFE filters that incorporate our designs and leverage our WaveX™ platform. 
 Our customer engagement process typically begins with the execution of a License Agreement, or LA, for specific bands. Depending on the complexity of the design, we estimate that initial samples of products to OEMs, will occur typically within nine to thirty-six months following execution of a license agreement. Following these development cycles, designs are manufactured, qualified by our customers and sampled to OEM customers. Our customers can take from three to six months to qualify a design and then the OEMs can take an additional three to six months, or longer, to qualify a design as fit for use, reliable and ready for mass production. The point at which an OEM begins taking product from our customers in mass production is typically when royalty revenues would begin. Our customer agreements typically provide for upfront design fees and royalty payments for each unit sold using our filter designs and typically last for a minimum of two years, but may be renewed for a longer period. More recently our agreements have included pre-paid royalties, which can be fully paid-up for a design, or a partial pre-pay with subsequent royalties when the part begins shipping. 
In 2017, in order to further facilitate our fabless filter program, and to provide manufacturing stability across the supply chain, we embarked on the creation of our Foundry Program. Foundries joining Resonant’s program first complete a 
foundry evaluation process to ensure alignment with our customers for filter performance, manufacturing quality and capacity, and business practices.  Once the evaluation is completed, the foundry runs a characterization lot, used to create a foundry process design kit, after which we are ready to start designs for manufacture in the foundry.  Packaging/Back-end vendors can also join the program by completing a back-end evaluation process to match their capabilities with foundry partners and our customers. Through this program we enable a secure supply chain for all our customers.
In 2019, we began development of Filter IP Standard Library designs to enable faster time to market for our customers. Further, the first Filter IP Library design was incorporated into Cadence Design Systems, Inc.'s AWR design suite, allowing module designers access to Resonant filter designs. At Mobile World Congress we showed the first 5G filter based upon XBAR® technology - an n79 filter. Subsequently, we accepted a $7.0 million investment and signed a commercial agreement for the development and license of filters for four bands based on XBAR® technology, with Murata Manufacturing Co.,Ltd. ("MMC"), the industry's largest provider of filters for the RFFE. The commercial agreement provides for our receipt of up to an aggregate of $9.0 million of contract consideration in the form of "pre-paid royalties" for the licensed designs and certain other intellectual property developed in the collaboration, payable in installments over a multi-year development period, with each installment conditioned upon our achievement of certain milestones and deliverables acceptable to our customer in its discretion. During 2020, we continued the development of filters under the commercial agreement, resulting in completion of the second milestone ahead of schedule in October 2020. This milestone is significant as it recognizes achieving predetermined target performance, packaging and initial reliability. Completion of the milestone also resulted in the second payment from this customer. In September 2021, we entered into Addendum 1 to the commercial agreement, which amends and supplements the agreement to provide for the development of XBAR®-based designs for up to four additional bands. For rights to these additional bands, the customer has agreed to pay us a $4.0 million non-refundable upfront payment and up to an aggregate of between $8.0 million and $36.0 million in prep-paid royalties and other fees, with the amount of the aggregate payments determined based on the complexity of the filter designs selected for development. In October 2021, we entered into the first statement of work under the amendment for a total of $7.0 million for the development of an additional band. We received a total of $11.5 million from MMC as of December 31, 2021. In accounting for this contract under ASC 606, we have determined the total contract consideration is to be recognized over time as the intellectual property is developed.
In 2021, we continued to develop XBAR®-based filters, both for the mobile market in collaboration with MMC, as well as for the non-mobile market. During the year we expanded our patent portfolio and ended the year with more than 415 issued and pending patents, with more than 265 patents protecting our XBAR® technology. In September 2021, we expanded our agreement with MMC for the design of up to four additional radio frequency bands. In October 2021, Resonant customers cumulatively surpassed the milestone of shipping 100 million RF filters designed with the Company's proprietary WaveX™ design platform.
We plan to continue to pursue filter design projects with existing and potential customers and other strategic partners. These types of arrangements offer complementary technology and market intelligence. In addition, we will continue to help develop a fabless filter eco-system to support the growth in filter volumes for our customers. We will continue to develop XBAR® technology for both mobile and non-mobile applications, including 5G, WiFi and Ultra-WideBand (UWB) applications, forming strategic partnerships with filter manufacturers and customers to bring the technology to market as quickly as possible. We intend to retain ownership of our technology, software, designs and related improvements. Our goal is to establish and leverage alliances with new and existing customers, who will help grow the market for our designs by integrating them with their own proprietary technology and products, or by using our software products for their own designs, thus combining their own particular strengths with ours to provide an extensive array of solutions.
Merger Agreement
On February 14, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Resonant, Murata Electronics North America, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Murata”), and PJ Cosmos Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Murata (“Purchaser”). Murata is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MMC.

The Mobile Internet
 The need for multiplexers, duplexers and other filters in the RFFE of mobile devices continues to grow rapidly due to rising consumer demand for always-on wireless broadband. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are quickly becoming the primary means of accessing the Internet. According to Cisco, there were 8.8 billion wireless devices in 2018, predicted to grow to 13.1 billion by 2023. To accommodate the increase in data usage, Cisco also predicts that WiFi hotspots will increase from 169 million in 2018 to 628 million by 2023.
The exponential growth in mobile data traffic is testing the limits of existing wireless bandwidth. Carriers and regulators have responded by opening new RF spectrum, driving up the number of frequency bands in mobile devices, with many of the most recent allocations being at higher frequencies than in the past, and of much wider bandwidths, thus pushing mobile phone designers to make more efficient use of spectrum. 
According to Navian Inc., the market for RFFE filters in mobile devices was 45.5 billion filters in 2019 and will grow to an estimated 72.0 billion filters by 2024.

     Adding RF spectrum to increase capacity and data-rate is not a complete solution. The added spectrum for 4G does not come in large contiguous blocks, but rather in small channels or bands of varying size and frequency. Thus, more data means more bands, and the result is a rapid and substantial increase in the number of bands in mobile devices. 5G introduces new challenges for filter performance and complexity, by adding much larger blocks of spectrum at higher frequencies (above 3GHz).
Challenges Faced by the Mobile Device Industry
The world is progressing toward ubiquitous RF coverage in which almost all devices will be connected, most wirelessly. Technology experts predict that by 2023 there will be over 29.3 billion connected devices operating worldwide and we will be measuring mobile usage in Exabytes. This overwhelming demand for wireless data has driven the carriers and regulators to open new spectrum bands.
This substantial and rapid increase in bands has created several significant problems, including a corresponding increase in the number of filters and duplexers in mobile devices. Traditional RF front-end solutions typically require one duplexer for each frequency band. The iPhone 13, model A2481, supports coverage for 24 FDD-LTE and 8 TDD-LTE bands, in addition to support for previous wireless technology generations, 3G and 2G, and most recently 5G coverage for sub-6GHz and mmWave. Each band requires a filter, either as an individual filter, a duplexer or a multiplexer, depending upon the spectrum and CA requirements. This increase in number and complexity of filters is dramatically driving up the cost of RF front-ends. In the latest global smartphones, filters, duplexers and multiplexers comprise more than half of the cost to the RF front-end, according to Mobile Experts. The dramatic increase in the number of filters required, which includes Chip Scale Package, or CSP, Wafer Level Package, or WLP, filters, duplexers, multiplexers, with multiple sizes and multiple packaging substrates, each requiring a new design, requires an increase in design capacity, or improved design efficiency. WaveX™ improves the design efficiency by accurately modeling the performance of acoustic wave filters.
The growing number of filters is also increasing the total size of the RF front-end. In some cases, size constraints require the OEM to fragment its product offering into multiple versions, each with a limited set of filters customized for a particular geographic region. Multiple versions of a mobile product increases manufacturing, inventory and distribution costs. In addition, consumers can find it difficult to roam between carriers and/or countries due to this splintering of bands and phone models. Phone OEMs would prefer to make one version of a product containing a full set of filters that can be electronically selected as required for a particular carrier network.
In addition, the higher frequency 4G bands tend to use relatively expensive BAW technology. Phone OEMs would prefer to use SAW manufacturing processes because of its lower cost and smaller size. However, conventional filter designs using SAW technology do not perform adequately in high frequency bands or in bands with closely spaced receive and transmit channels, typical of many new bands. With the introduction of 5G, which uses even higher frequencies and wider bandwidths, this problem is further exacerbated. 
Adding to the complexity of the industry, mobile devices must now be capable of receiving from two, to as many as five, downlink bands simultaneously, known as downlink CA. This CA requirement creates the need for complex multiplexing filters, or multiplexers, which are significantly more complex than duplexers and effectively require four filters for each CA combination. In addition, during the transition to 5G, dual connectivity to both 4G LTE and 5G New Radio (NR) networks is required. 3rd Generation Partnership Project has identified over 400 worldwide band combinations, creating increased complexity and cost to RFFEs. In the case of a quadplexer, with four different frequency bands, within each band the signal loss must be minimized, while rejecting three bands often in close proximity. Duplexers must only reject a single band. Mobile Experts predicts that more than 2 billion terminals will be shipped supporting CA in 2024. This rising complexity in the industry is also aggravating the constraints on design capacity and resources.
In addition to the challenges described above, 5G will further exacerbate the problems of more demand for filters, filter designs, and more complexity and integration in the RFFE. 5G comprises three distinct segments:
•Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB): Increased bandwidth for extreme data-rates and capacity to support wireless video everywhere;
•Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC): High reliability, low latency and high security for automotive, health and government; and
•Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC): Low cost, low energy, long life for wearables, smart home devices and interconnected devices.
    All three of these segments require filters and will further accelerate the already substantial growth in the filter market. 
Our Technology
RFFE module companies currently produce filters internally or purchase filters from third-party manufacturers, such as Broadcom, Murata, Taiyo-Yuden and Qualcomm. These module companies and filter manufacturers design filters using their 
own internal resources, which we believe are proving insufficient to meet the explosive growth in both total global filter demand and unique filter designs, as well as the increasingly complex filter requirements necessitated in part by crowded spectrum and carrier aggregation. We believe that our patented WaveX™ technology will enable us to design complex filter products with shortened design times and help our customers benefit from the use of more cost-effective manufacturing processes. WaveX™ can be summarized as a two-step process:
We use circuit models to optimize initial designs.  Most of the filter industry models acoustic wave filters using a coupling-of-modes, or COM, model. In contrast, we use circuit models derived from the actual physics of acoustic wave filters. Circuit models are computationally much faster, which allows for very quick optimization of the many possible solutions that result from the synthesis process. We can quickly compare large numbers of different, optimized solutions before commencing the third step - lengthy but highly accurate simulations based on fundamental methods.
We use fundamental models to simulate final designs. Our highly accurate models are based entirely on fundamental material properties and dimensions, again unlike the common practice in the industry today.  The precision and accuracy of our models allows for far fewer turns through the fab to reach the desired product performance.  Because our models are fundamental, integration with our foundry and fab customers is eased due to the understanding of the basic material properties and dimensions of the fab.
Using our WaveX™ design platform, in 2018 we invented a new resonator technology, XBAR®, with fundamental properties matching the new wireless requirements of higher frequency, wider bandwidth and higher power operation, when compared to previous wireless generations. At Mobile World Congress in 2019 we demonstrated a 5G (n79) filter prototype with the required bandwidth to support 5G operation across the entire band. XBAR® technology is applicable to many current and projected wireless technologies which operate above 3GHz. Hence we are developing designs for both mobile and non-mobile applications for 5G and WiFi, and fully expect to extend this to UWB and 6G. In addition to the fundamental advantages of XBAR®, the straightforward processing for this BAW resonator, lends itself to low cost manufacturing. 
Our Commercialization Plan
We will continue to pursue filter design projects with existing and potential customers and other strategic partners, and we believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of delivering our solutions to the market and validating the technical advantages of our tools, IP and team. In addition, we will continue to help develop a fabless filter eco-system to support the growth in the filter volumes for our customers. We will continue to develop XBAR® technology for both mobile and non-mobile applications, including 5G, WiFi and Ultra-WideBand (UWB) applications, forming strategic partnerships with filter manufacturers and customers to bring the technology to market as quickly as possible. We intend to retain ownership of our technology, designs and related improvements and charge royalties based on sales of filters that incorporate our designs. We do not intend to manufacture or sell any physical products or operate as a contract design company developing designs for a fee. Our strategy is to establish and leverage alliances with customers, who will help grow the market for our designs by integrating them with their own proprietary technology and products, thus combining their own particular strengths with ours to provide an extensive array of solutions and to develop and license filter designs that offer improvements in the time to develop, cost, size and performance of RFFEs. The goal for our designs is to improve profit margins and increase market share for our customers.
Our customers are filter manufacturers, RFFE module manufacturers, RF active and passive component suppliers and potentially mobile handset OEMs. Currently, for most of our customers, we license specific, custom designs. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we introduced and announced the first customer for our standard IP filter library of products. In these cases we develop a standard design at one of our qualified foundries and customers can then license this design without paying for or waiting for completion of development, hence minimizing their cost and reducing time to market. We charge royalties at a fixed amount per filter or as a percentage of sales price. In October 2019, we announced a commercial agreement with the industry's largest provider of filters for the RFFE to develop and license filters based on XBAR®  technology. In this case, we determined the total amount of royalties expected to result from the licenses being designed and discounted the rate in exchange for prepayment of the amount in advance. The customer agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $9.0 million for the licensed designs and certain other intellectual property developed in the collaboration, payable in installments over a multi-year development period, with each installment conditional upon our achievement of certain milestones and deliverables acceptable to our customer in its discretion. During 2021 the customer entered into an addendum to the collaboration agreement which added up to four additional bands over a multi-year period, the first of which was added during the year. The addendum required an upfront non-refundable payment of $4.0 million and an aggregate of between $8.0 million and $36.0 million, depending on the complexity of the selected bands. The additional band selected during 2021 required an upfront non-refundable fee of $3.0 million and milestone payments totaling $3.0 million due upon the occurrence of certain future events. We expect to generate substantially all of our near-term revenues with these types of licensing arrangements. Each filter design and related royalty stream is expected to have a finite commercial life as mobile devices continue to evolve. Our plan is to offer our customers 
replacement designs as existing designs become obsolete. Revenue from our contracts may be recognized over time or at a point-in-time depending on the facts and circumstances of each contract.
Our products will be designed for manufacture with existing high-volume fabrication processes allowing rapid time to market, but we do not plan to manufacture or sell any physical components. Unlike a manufacturing company, we intend to create designs for manufacturers, eliminating for us the costs and problems associated with manufacturing and inventory. This allows us to concentrate on our unique expertise, leaving the hardware manufacturers to drive their own economies of scale.
We also believe that the power of Resonant WaveX™ tools and methodology will continue to enable fabless customers and filter foundries to newly enter or expand their participation in the supply chain for RF filters. In late 2016, we expanded our customer focus to include fabless filter manufacturers, which are companies that do not have their own internal filter fabrication facility. Typically, these companies already are supplying other products in the RFFE to the OEM, and as a result, do not require a protracted new vendor qualification process in order to supply parts. In 2017, to further facilitate our fabless filter program and to provide manufacturing stability across the supply chain to our fully integrated filter customers, we created our Foundry Program. It is through this program that we can enable a secure supply chain for all our customers. In 2019, we began development of Filter IP Standard Library designs to enable faster time to market for our customers. 
Single Band Designs
We continue to develop a series of SAW filter designs for RF frequency bands presently dominated by the larger and more expensive BAW filters. In 2020, we continued to develop single band, SAW filter designs for customers. Some of these filter designs are for duplexers that have historically been TC-SAWs or BAWs while others are for discrete SAW filters that may need improvements in performance, size or cost. The single band designs included WiFi Co-Existence filters, which pass licensed wireless frequencies, while protecting against WiFi interference, and designs for module applications which require wafer-level packaging (WLP) and modeling of the module board. We believe that, using our WaveX™ technology, combined with our experience and know-how, we can design innovative SAW filters that meet the performance requirements for many of these bands but at significantly less cost than that of BAW filters they would replace.  These single band filter designs were the earliest opportunity for royalty revenues.
Multiplexer Designs
Wireless carriers worldwide are experiencing increasing demand for higher data speeds. CA allows multiple data streams from different frequencies to be added together to provide increased data rate for the mobile users. However, CA further complicates the required filter characteristics. Quadplexers, (4-RF path multiplexer) as described above, enable CA on both receive and transmit paths and reduce the RFFE complexity by reducing the number of switches, but the complexity of the filters themselves increases dramatically. During 2018, we expanded our capability to optimize the performance of quadplexers on OEM phone-boards in order to help our customers demonstrate "real world" performance. During 2019, we expanded our capability to produce TC-SAW and high power quadplexer designs. We believe that our WaveX™ design platform is ideally suited to these difficult filter design problems that cover a wide frequency range with much more demanding performance requirements.
Although some band combinations for aggregation will not require multiplexers, we believe that multiplexers are the best solution for bands in close frequency proximity. We are developing high performance multiplexer designs to address this growing market.
XBAR® Filters
Our WaveX™ design platform enabled us to invent a new resonator technology, XBAR®. Large instantaneous bandwidth filters at high frequency (above 3GHz) are required for next generation wireless technologies, such as 5G, WiFi 6E and UWB, to support high data-rates. Filters using XBAR® resonators are ideally suited for these applications. During 2021, we continued to develop XBAR® filter designs for our partner, focused on the mobile market. In addition, we designed and had fabricated through our foundries XBAR® designs for 5G and WiFi non-mobile applications 
Our immediate focus is to address the problems in the RFFE with innovative single-band and multiplex designs made possible with our WaveX™ design platform. These designs present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization of our technology. We expect the trend towards spectrum proliferation, particularly with new 5G spectrum, in addition to CA and MIMO, will require complex filters and multiplexing. We believe our WaveX™ and XBAR®  technology will enable cost effective designs for these applications. 
Intellectual Property
We have an active program protecting our proprietary technology. In protecting our technology, we make use of patent, trade secret, trademark and mask works protections. To maximize these protections, we maintain active intellectual property development and protection programs, including with respect to patents, trade secrets, trademarks and mask works.
Our patent portfolio is the result of an active and ongoing program to identify, protect and commercialize our intellectual property. This program includes the development of a comprehensive patent strategy. We engage in a thorough process of patent landscaping that provides an in-depth analysis of not only the markets we are addressing, but also adjacent markets, so that we can tactically and strategically protect our position in the market through patent filings. We also routinely use specialized outside firms to assist in these endeavors. These firms assist with invention identification, intellectual property strategy and competitive landscape analysis. Through our landscaping and advanced product development processes we have plans to file additional patents in 2022.
Our patent portfolio comprises more than 415 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents, with more than 265 targeting XBAR. This patent portfolio relates primarily to the following subject matters:
•Physical Implementation 
•Design Synthesis and Optimization Speed
•Network Synthesis
•Image Design
•Circuit Designs
•Simulation Accuracy
•Next Generation Designs/Architectures    
•Simplifying the RFFE
•XBAR
•Circuit Structure
•Critical Design Requirements
•Power handling and linearity 
•Temperature dependence
•Yield Analysis
We have a formal trade secret program to identify and protect technologies and know-how that derive significant economic value from being secret. This program is managed to provide the optimal levels of protection and competitive advantage to us. We protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information by maintaining the secrecy of such information, including by requiring confidentiality agreements from all our employees, consultants and third parties having access to such information. We have a number of trade secrets already protected in this program and we expect to add more such trade secrets into the program in 2022.
We have also registered U.S. trademarks for ‘‘Resonant®’’, ‘‘WaveX™”, and “XBAR®”.
There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications or any future patent applications will be approved or will not be challenged successfully by third parties, that any issued patents will protect our technology or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that have been or may be issued to us.
    Despite our efforts to maintain the secrecy of our trade secrets, there also can be no assurance that others will not gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can meaningfully protect our technology. Nor can there be assurances that we will succeed in enforcing our trade secrets in the event others improperly gain access to them. In addition, effective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.
Competition
To our knowledge, we have no direct competitors in the electronic design automation or licensing business that are exclusively focused on RFFEs. We have spent many years developing WaveX™, and our own patented suite of design tools created specifically for this purpose. No comparable acoustic wave filter design tool exists in the market today to our knowledge. In combination with our experienced design team, we believe we offer our customers a novel solution to the need 
for increasingly complex filter designs developed by an independent, stand-alone company that is not presently offered by any other company.
We have advantages that we believe present significant barriers to entry for potential competitors that desire to replicate our business model:
•a large and growing portfolio of patents and trade secrets;
•a suite of proprietary software design tools;
•a growing number of customers;
•a highly experienced design team; and
•a multi-year technology lead. 
We do compete with the existing filter designs and design capabilities of the design teams at our customers and target customers and their filter manufacturers. We must demonstrate to our customers, target customers and their filter manufacturers, that switching to our designs will give them a competitive advantage by providing market entry or sufficiently improving the cost, size, and performance of their current products to justify our royalty rates.
The use of our patented WaveX™ tools, not only enables lower cost and smaller size SAW solutions for single band and multiplexer designs but also enables development of creative filter solutions for next generation RFFE architectures that, if successful will offer new, highly competitive solutions to many of the challenges facing the manufacturers of RFFE modules.
Human Capital Resources
We have 73 employees as of December 31, 2021, 54 of which are on our technical staff and 19 of which are devoted to finance, sales, marketing and administration matters. We compete for the limited number of highly talented RF filter engineers and work to attract and retain technical talent through offering competitive compensation and benefit packages. We are focused on retaining key contributors, developing our staff, and cultivating their commitment to our Company. We have three primary locations, in California and Texas, where our employees provide services. We also use several outside consultants.
