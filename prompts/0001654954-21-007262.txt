   ●
  We are dependent upon access to external sources of capital to grow our business;

   ●
  We face risks related to the intended restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019, and being further delayed in complying with our Securities & Exchange Commission reporting obligations if we are unable to resume a timely filing schedule;

  RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL HEMP BUSINESS
  
   ●
  New legislation or regulations which impose substantial new regulatory requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution and sale of hemp-derived products could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
 RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY AND OUR SECURITIES
  
   ●
 Our Series D preferred stock is subordinate to our existing and future debt, and interests of the Series D preferred stock could be diluted by the issuance of additional preferred shares and by other transactions;
   ●
  We could be prevented from paying cash dividends on the Series D preferred stock due to prescribed legal requirements;

   ●
  Our two principal stockholders who are also our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and director and our Chief Operating Officer have significant influence over us;

   ●
  Our stock has historically had a limited market. If an active trading market for our common stock does develop, trading prices may be volatile; and

  Overview
  
  Youngevity, formerly AL International, Inc., founded in 1996, operates in three segments: (i) the direct selling segment where products are offered through a global distribution network of preferred customers and distributors, (ii) the commercial coffee segment where products are sold directly to businesses and (iii) the commercial hemp segment where we manufacture proprietary systems to provide end-to-end extraction and processing that allow for the conversion of hemp feed stock into hemp oil and hemp extracts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we operated in two business segments, our direct selling segment, and our commercial coffee segment. During the first quarter of 2019, through the acquisition of the assets of Khrysos Global, Inc. we added the commercial hemp as a third business segment to our operations as further discussed below.

  ●
   Our commercial coffee segment is operated through CLR Roasters, LLC (“CLR”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Siles Plantation Family Group S.A. (“Siles”).

 
  ●
   Our commercial hemp segment is operated through our subsidiaries, Khrysos Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“KII”), which acquired the assets of Khrysos Global Inc., a Florida corporation, (“Khrysos Global”) in February 2019 and its wholly-owned subsidiaries of Khrysos Global, INXL Laboratories, Inc., a Florida corporation (“INXL”) and INX Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation (“INXH”).

 
  Non-reliance of Previously Issued Financial Statements
  
  On October 16, 2020 the Company filed a notice of non-reliance on previously issued financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), reporting the Company’s Audit Committee determined that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 contained in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed with the SEC on May 20, 2019, August 14, 2019 and November 18, 2019 should no longer be relied upon. Similarly, related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for those periods should no longer be relied upon. As a result, the Company intends to file a restatement related to these periods as soon as practicable. The intended restatements are related to the Company’s commercial coffee segment and the commercial hemp segment, further details are summarized below:
 Commercial Coffee Segment
  
  During the Company’s 2019 annual audit, the Company reviewed revenues related to CLR, specifically the 2019 green coffee sales program, for sales made by the Company to its joint venture partner, H&H Coffee Group Export Corp. (“H&H Export”) and for sales recorded to major independent customers. These sales were originally recorded at gross (revenue recorded without reduction for cost to purchase the inventory).
  
  As part of the review, the Company assessed whether the 2019 green coffee sales to H&H Export depicted the transfer of promised goods or services to H&H Export in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For sales made to major independent customers, the Company assessed whether revenue was recognizable.
  
  For both reviews, the following five steps were applied to review if the core revenue recognition principles were meet:
 
  ●
   Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer

 
  ●
   Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract

 
  ●
   Step 3: Determine the transaction price

 
  ●
   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract

 
  ●
   Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation

 
  During this review process the Company focused on identifying the performance obligations in the contracts with H&H Export. The Company’s review indicated that per the underlying terms and conditions of the contracts entered into with H&H Export, (the provider of the “wet” green coffee and the buyer of the processed coffee), that CLR is assigned the green coffee beans as coffee is delivered to its mill processing facility. Assignment of the coffee is defined as taking of physical possession of the green coffee for the purpose of processing the green coffee. Under the assignment CLR is responsible for insuring all reasonable and necessary actions to ensure the coffee beans are safeguarded during processing at the Company’s coffee mill. CLR does not take ownership and does not incur financial risk associated with the coffee as it is delivered to its mill. Based on the above assessment, management has concluded that CLR does not control the green coffee before it is provided to H&H Export, at the point of sale to H&H Export.
  
  Management has determined that when CLR provides the processed green coffee to H&H export, the goods or services provided to H&H Export is the performance obligation to provide milling services for the green coffee. As such, the Company is the agent for the milling services.

  Management has also determined that since the Company does not control the green coffee beans at the point of delivery to the mill, and that legal title to the green coffee beans is transferred momentarily, before the green coffee beans are sold back to H&H Export, that the Company is therefore an agent in sales transactions of green coffee beans to H&H Export.
 
  Therefore, management has determined that for green coffee sales made by the Company to its joint venture partner, H&H Export, the Company should have recorded these sales at net of costs to purchase inventory, which reflects the value of the performance obligation to provide milling services. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company is reporting its revenue for coffee when sold to H&H Export at net.
 
  With regard to sales made to major independent customers, the Company focused on if recognition of revenue thresholds were met and if the company had satisfied its performance obligation and could reasonably expect payment for fulling these performance obligations. The Company determined that for certain sales to major customers, these thresholds were not met, and therefore revenue should not have been recognized.
 
  The Company intends to restate its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2019, three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 related to this change in revenue recognition. (See Note 3 under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.).
    
  Commercial Hemp Segment
  
  In conjunction with the Company’s 2019 annual audit the Company concluded that certain fixed assets acquired in the acquisition of KII and the share price valuation for the common stock issued as consideration were not fairly valued as of the closing date February 12, 2019 which resulted in a decrease to the net assets acquired including; a) $1,127,000 related to the certain fixed assets, and b) $1,351,000 related to a change in the fair value of common stock issuance resulting in an increase to goodwill of $2,478,000 acquired and an adjusted aggregate purchase price of $15,894,000. The Company intends to restate its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2019, three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. (See Note 2 under “Khrysos Global, Inc.” for further discussion regarding this acquisition.)
 Segment Information
  
  The direct selling segment develops and distributes health and wellness products through its global independent direct selling network also known as multi-level marketing. The commercial coffee segment is engaged in coffee roasting and distribution, specializing in gourmet coffee and the sale and processing of green coffee beans. The commercial hemp segment manufactures proprietary systems to provide end-to-end extraction and processing that allow for the conversion of hemp feed stock into hemp oil and hemp extracts.
  
  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 86.1% of our revenue from our direct sales, approximately 13.3% of our revenue from our commercial coffee sales and approximately 0.6% from the commercial hemp segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 85.5% of our revenue from our direct sales and approximately 14.5% of our revenue from our commercial coffee sales.
  
  Direct Selling Segment. In the direct selling segment, we sell health and wellness, beauty product and skin care, scrap booking and story booking items, packaged food products and other service-based products on a global basis and more recently our Hemp FX™ hemp-derived cannabinoid (“CBD”) product line and offer a wide range of products through an international direct selling network. Our direct sales are made through our network, which is a web-based global network of customers and distributors. Our independent sales force markets a variety of products to an array of customers, through friend-to-friend marketing and social networking. We consider our Company to be an e-commerce company whereby personal interaction is provided to customers by our independent sales network. Initially, our focus was solely on the sale of products in the health, beauty, and home care market through our marketing network; however, we have since expanded our selling efforts to include a variety of other products in other markets. Our direct selling segment offers approximately 5,500 products to support a healthy lifestyle including:

● Health and Wellness | ● Gourmet Coffee | ● Digital Products 
● Lifestyle Products | ● Packaged Foods | ● Telecare Health Services

  Since 2012, we have expanded our operations through a series of acquisitions of the assets and equity of 24 direct selling companies including their product lines and sales forces. We have also substantially expanded our distributor base by merging the assets that we have acquired under our web-based independent distributor network, as well as providing our distributors with additional new products to add to their product offerings.

  Commercial Coffee Segment. In the commercial coffee segment, we engage in the commercial sale of roasted coffee products and distribution of green coffee beans, through CLR, our wholly-owned subsidiary which was established in 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 5.4% of our coffee revenue from our green coffee sales, 32.8% from our milling and processing services and approximately 61.8% of our coffee revenue from our roasted coffee sales.
  
  We own a traditional coffee roasting business that sells roasted coffee products under its own Café La Rica brand, Josie’s Java House brand, Javalution brands, and Café Cachita. CLR produces and sells a variety of private labels through major national sales outlets and to major customers including cruise lines and office coffee service operators, as well as through our direct selling business. CLR produces and markets a unique line of coffees with health benefits under the JavaFit® brand which is sold directly to consumers. In April 2017, CLR reached an agreement with Major League Baseball's Miami Marlins to feature CLR’s Café La Rica Gourmet Espresso coffee as the “Official Cafecito of the Miami Marlins” at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida. The current agreement with the Miami Marlins is through the 2021 baseball season. In January 2019, CLR acquired the Café Cachita brand of espresso and in February 2019 we announced the expansion of our Café Cachita brand of espresso into retail stores throughout Southeastern Grocers.  The new distribution footprint now includes all Winn Dixie, Bi-Lo, Fresco Y Mas, Save Mart, and Harveys stores. In June 2019, we announced all-store distribution for CLR’s Javalution™ Hemp Infused Coffee Brand, with orders shipping on the east coast to Save Mart during the end of the first quarter of 2020 and continue to ship orders to Save Mart throughout 2020 and now 2021.
  
  Our roasting facility located in Miami, Florida, is 50,000 square feet and is SQF Level 2 certified, which is a stringent food safety process that verifies the coffee bean processing plant and distribution facility is in compliance with Certified HACCP (Hazard Analysis, Critical Control Points) food safety plans.
  
  In March 2014, we expanded our commercial coffee segment and started our new green coffee distribution business with CLR’s acquisition of Siles, located in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Siles includes “La Pita,” a dry-processing facility on approximately 26 acres of land and “El Paraiso,” a coffee plantation consisting of approximately 500 acres of land and thousands of coffee plants which produces 100 percent Arabica coffee beans that are shade grown, Organic, Rainforest Alliance Certified™ and Fair Trade Certified™. The plantation and dry-processing facility allow CLR to control the coffee production process from field-to-cup. The dry-processing plant allows CLR to produce and sell green coffee to major coffee suppliers in the United States (the “U.S.”) and around the world.
  
  As part of the 2014 Siles acquisition, CLR engaged the owners of H&H Coffee Group Export Corp. (“H&H Export”) and Hernandez, Hernandez, Export Y Compania Limitada (“H&H”), Alain Piedra Hernandez (“Mr. Hernandez”) and Marisol Del Carmen Siles Orozco (“Ms. Orozco”), as employees to manage Siles and entered into an operating agreement with them that provides for the sharing of profits and losses generated by Siles after certain conditions are met. CLR has made improvements to the land and facilities since 2014. Additionally, CLR has contracted with H&H who is an agent of the local producers in Nicaragua to supply unprocessed green coffee, to our mill. We do not grow the green coffee that we process and sell and instead the green coffee that we process and sell originates with local producers in Nicaragua. We do not have a direct relationship with the local producers and are dependent on H&H, who serves as an agent and assigns the unprocessed green coffee beans acquired from local producers to our mill, insuring that our mill has a supply of raw green coffee on a timely and efficient manner. During the year ended December 31, 2019, all of the unprocessed green coffee processed through our mill was assigned from H&H.
  
  CLR acquires processed green coffee beans from H&H Export, who releases the processed green coffee beans and invoices CLR for those processed green coffee beans as CLR sells processed green coffee to major coffee suppliers in the U.S. and around the world. CLR, from time to time will also supply H&H Export with milling services that ultimately provide H&H Export with processed green coffee. As CLR does not control the green coffee prior to transferring control to H&H Export, these transactions are recognized as milling services. The goods or services provided to H&H Export for these transactions is the performance obligation to provide milling services for the green coffee.
  
 In January 2019, to accommodate CLR’s green coffee purchase contract, CLR entered into an agreement with H&H, H&H Export, Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Orozco, collectively referred to as (the “Nicaraguan Partner”), pursuant to which the Nicaraguan Partner agreed to transfer a 45-acre tract of land in Matagalpa, Nicaragua (the “Matagalpa Property”) to be owned 50% by the Nicaraguan Partner and 50% by CLR. In consideration for the land acquisition we issued to H&H Export, 153,846 shares of our common stock. The fair value of the shares issued was $1,200,000 and was based on the stock price on the date of issuance of the shares. In addition, the Nicaraguan Partner and CLR agreed to contribute $4,700,000 each toward construction of a processing plant, office, and storage facilities on the Matagalpa Property (collectively the “Matagalpa Mill”) for processing coffee in Nicaragua. The addition of the Matagalpa Mill will accommodate CLR’s green coffee contract commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, CLR made payments of $2,150,000 and $900,000, respectively, towards the Matagalpa Mill project. At December 31, 2019, CLR contributed a total of $3,050,000 towards the Matagalpa Mill project, in addition $391,117 was paid for operating equipment and the Nicaraguan Partner contributed a total of $1,922,000. CLR’s remaining portion of $1,650,000 was paid during 2020, including an additional $912,606 related to operating equipment. As of the date of this filing, the Matagalpa Mill is in construction and was not ready for full operations.

KII offers various rental, sales, and service programs of their extraction and processing systems. (See Note 2 & Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
  
  Products and Services
  
  We employ certain web enabled systems to increase distributor support, which allows distributors to run their business more efficiently and allows us to improve our order-processing accuracy.

  Distribution
  
  Direct Selling Segment. We presently sell products domestically in 50 states and internationally, with operations in the U.S. and currently fourteen international distribution centers. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 approximately 14% of our revenue were derived from sales outside the U.S. We primarily sell our products to the ultimate consumer through the direct selling channel. Our distributors are required to pay a onetime enrollment fee and receive a welcome kit specific to that country region that consists of forms, policy and procedures, selling aids, and access to our distributor website, prior to commencing services for us as a distributor. Distributors are independent contractors and not our employees. Distributors earn a profit by purchasing products directly from us at a discount from a published brochure price and selling them to their customers, the ultimate consumer of our products. We generally have no arrangements with end users of our products beyond the distributors, except as described below.
  
  A distributor may contact customers directly, selling primarily through our online or printed brochures, which highlight new products and special promotions for each of our sales campaigns. In this sense, the distributor, together with the brochure, is the “store” through which our products are sold. A brochure introducing new sales campaigns is frequently produced and our websites and social networking activity take place on a continuous basis. Generally, distributors and customers forward orders using the internet, mail, telephone, or fax and payments are processed via credit card or other acceptable forms of payment at the time an order is placed. Orders are processed, and the products are assembled primarily at our distribution center in Chula Vista, California and delivered to distributors, distribution centers and customers through a variety of local, national and international delivery companies.
  
  Introducing new distributors and the training of the new distributors are the primary responsibilities of key independent distributors supported by our marketing home office staff. The independent distributors are independent contractors compensated exclusively based on total sales of products achieved by their down-line distributors and customers. Although the independent distributors are not paid a fee for recruiting or introducing additional distributors, they have the incentive to recruit and onboard additional distributors to increase their opportunities for increasing their total product sales and related sales commissions. Acquisitions of other direct selling businesses and personal contacts, including recommendations from current distributors, and local market advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new distributors and customers. Distributors also can earn bonuses based on the net sales of products made by distributors they have recruited and trained in addition to discounts earned on their own sales of our products. This program can be unlimited based on the level achieved in accordance with the compensation plan that can change from time to time at our discretion. The primary responsibilities of sales leaders are the prospecting, appointing, training and development of their down-line distributors and customers while maintaining a certain level of their own sales.
  
  Commercial Coffee Segment. Our coffee segment is operated by CLR. The segment operates a coffee roasting plant and distribution facility located in Miami, Florida. The 50,000-square foot plant contains two commercial grade roasters and four commercial grade grinders capable of roasting 10 million pounds of coffee annually. The plant contains a variety of packaging equipment capable of producing two-ounce fractional packs, vacuum sealed brick packaging for espresso, various bag packaging configurations ranging from eight ounces up to a five-pound bag package. The coffee segment’s single-serve K-Cup filling equipment can produce 35 million K-Cups annually of our own brands and private label orders. 
  
  Commercial Hemp Segment. Our commercial hemp segment, located in central Florida, includes an 82,000 square foot hemp processing and manufacturing facility in Orlando, Florida, to house its processing hemp derived products and finished goods manufacturing facility. The Orlando facility holds the post processing equipment and the extensive power systems. In addition to the Orlando facility, KII owns a laboratory testing facility located in Clermont, Florida, that provides capabilities in regard to formulation, quality control, and testing standards with CBD products. In addition, KII owns a production shop located in Mascotte, Florida. In 2021, KII shifted its focus back to its primary core business of extraction of cannabinoids and the production of products for sale with the cannabinoids. As a result, currently the Clermont, Florida property is for sale. The Mascotte, Florida property is expected to be listed for sale by the end of 2021. KII, expects to continue to lease the Orlando, Florida. (See Note 2 & Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
  
  Seasonality and Back Orders
  
  Our business in both the direct selling and commercial coffee segment can experience weaker sales during the summer months; however, based on recent experience, seasonality has not been material to our operating results.  Our business in the commercial hemp segment has not experienced effects of seasonality in its operating results, however due to the price fluctuations of biomass the hemp segment can experience fluctuations in costs of sales. We have not experienced significant back orders in any of our segments.

  Promotion and Marketing
  
  Direct Selling Segment. Sales promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting distributors through sales aids such as brochures, product samples, demonstration product videos and live training sessions. To support the efforts of distributors to reach new customers, specially designed sales aids, promotional pieces, customer flyers, radio and print advertising are used. In addition, we seek to motivate our distributors using special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic sales meetings with our independent distributors are conducted by our home office staff. The meetings are designed to keep distributors abreast of product line changes, explain sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance.
  
  Several merchandising techniques are used, including the introduction of new products, the use of combination offers, the use of trial sizes and samples, and the promotion of products packaged as gift items. In general, for each sales campaign, a distinctive brochure or flyer is published, in which new products are introduced and selected items are offered as special promotions or are given prominence in the brochure. A key current priority for our merchandising is to continue the use of pricing and promotional models to enable a deeper, fact-based understanding of the role and impact of pricing within our product portfolio.
  
  Commercial Coffee Segment. Sales promotion and sales development primarily take place via the CLR in-house team. CLR works diligently to be sure that CLR is invited to participate in the request-for-proposal process that comes up each year on major coffee contracts. CLR's in-house sales team consists of five people that devote the majority of their time to obtaining new business. CLR has established a direct store distribution route that it utilizes to market, promote and ship its Café La Rica and Josie’s Java House brands. Various promotion strategies and advertisements in retail circulars are utilized to support the brands being marketed through the direct store distribution route.
 
  The versatility of the plant supports a diverse customer base. The coffee segment is a large supplier to the hospitality market with a great focus prior to the COVID-19 pandemic on serving the cruise line industry. A major revenue producing area is the private label market where the Company produces coffee for various retailer owned private brands. The segment supplies coffee and equipment to retirement communities, services the office coffee service segment, and markets through distributors to the convenient store market; CLR also markets its own brands of coffee to various retailers. Our CLR owned brands that are currently on retail shelves includes Café La Rica and the Josie’s Java House of brands.
  
  The commercial coffee segment also includes our green coffee business. CLR is engaged in coffee roasting and distribution, specializing in gourmet coffee and the sale of processed green coffee beans and providing mill processing services of unprocessed green coffee beans. CLR is supplied with unprocessed green coffee beans direct from the plantation in Nicaragua, Central America and the nearby farms, extracts green coffee beans from the procured coffee cherries through the process of drying in the sun or the process of pulping, fermentation, washing and drying of the coffee beans and sells processed coffee beans to other coffee distributors. With the addition of the Nicaragua plantation and dry-processing facility we have further expanded our coffee segment with the ability to process green coffee not only for our own use but also provide this service to other coffee growers. CLR also purchases green coffee beans from our non-Nicaragua sources as well.
  
  Commercial Hemp Segment. Sales promotion and sales development for hemp-related products and services primarily take place via in-house sales teams. The in-house sales teams are divided into three groups that primarily promote products and services at various regional and national trade shows as well as through potential clients provided by sales representatives.
  
  Suppliers
  
  Direct Selling Segment. We purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers. To achieve certain economies of scale, best pricing and uniform quality, we rely primarily on a few principal suppliers. Other than the coffee products produced through CLR, all our products are manufactured by independent suppliers.
  
  Sufficient raw materials were available during the year ended December 31, 2019 and we believe they will continue to be. We monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers, their ability to supply our needs, and the market conditions for these raw materials. We believe we will be able to negotiate similar market terms with alternative suppliers if needed. Though with the impact of COVID-19, subsequent to 2019 as result of the pandemic we have experienced a decline in availability of products and associated time delays from our suppliers.
  
 
   
-10-



 
 
  For the year ended December 31, 2019, the direct selling segment made purchases from two vendors, Global Health Labs, Inc. and Michael Schaeffer, LLC, that individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 41% of total segment purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the direct selling segment made purchases from two vendors, Global Health Labs, Inc. and Purity Supplements, that individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 41% of total segment purchases.
  
  Commercial Coffee Segment.  We primarily obtain green coffee from Nicaragua. We primarily utilize H&H as an outside broker to supply our mill with unprocessed green coffee. H&H is the outside brokers that provides the largest supply of our unprocessed green coffee. For large contracts, CLR works to negotiate a price lock with its suppliers to protect CLR and its customers from price fluctuations that take place in the commodities market.
  
  We also produce green coffee from CLR’s own plantation it acquired in Nicaragua in 2014. We do not believe that CLR is substantially dependent upon nor exposed to any significant concentration risk related to purchases from any single vendor, given the availability of alternative sources from which we may purchase inventory. The supply and price of coffee are subject to high volatility. Supply and price of all coffee grades are affected by multiple factors, such as weather, pest damage, politics, competitive pressures, the relative value of the U.S. currency and economics in the producing countries. To achieve certain economies of scale, best pricing and uniform quality, we rely primarily on a few principal suppliers, namely, Rothfos Corporation and H&H.
  
  For the year ended December 31, 2019, the commercial coffee segment made purchases of green coffee beans from four vendors, INTL FC Stone Merchant Services, Rothfos Corporation, Sixto Packaging and the Serengeti Trading Co., that individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 73% of our total segment purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the commercial coffee segment made purchases of processed green coffee beans from two vendors, H&H and Rothfos Corporation, which individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 83% of total segment purchases.
  
  Commercial Hemp Segment. We purchase raw materials from numerous domestic suppliers to produce hemp-CBD oil, isolate and distillate as well as to manufacture hemp extraction equipment. To achieve certain economies of scale, best pricing, and uniform quality, we rely primarily on a few principal suppliers.
  
  For the year ended December 31, 2019 the commercial hemp segment made purchases from two vendors, BioProcessing Corp. Ltd. and Xtraction Services, Inc., that individually comprised more than 10% of total segment purchases and in aggregate approximated 47% of total segment purchases.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We have developed, and we use registered trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own several trademarks that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and we also own trademarks in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico, and Russia. Registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered trademark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third-party in the respective country of registration, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. 
  
  We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of our brands and the effective marketing of our products. We intend to maintain and keep current all our trademark registrations and to pay all applicable renewal fees as they become due. The right of a trademark owner to use its trademarks, however, is based on a number of factors, including their first use in commerce, and trademark owners can lose trademark rights despite trademark registration and payment of renewal fees. We therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete, and if for any reason we were unable to maintain our trademarks, our sales of the related products bearing such trademarks could be materially and negatively affected. See “Risk Factors”.
  
  We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Most of our products are not protected by patents and therefore such agreements are often our only form of protection.  Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws.
  
 
   
-11-



 
 
  We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
  
  Industry
  
  We are engaged in three industries, the direct selling industry, the coffee industry, and the hemp industry.
  
  Direct Selling Segment. Direct selling is a business distribution model that allows a company to market its products directly to consumers by means of independent contractors and relationship referrals. Independent, unsalaried salespeople, referred to as distributors, represent us and are awarded a commission based upon the volume of product sold through each of their independent business operations.
  
  The World Federation of Direct Selling Association reported in its June 2019 Global Sales by Product Category - 2018 report that the fastest growing product category in 2018 was wellness followed by cosmetics & personal care, representing approximately 64% of total retail sales. Wellness products include weight-loss products and dietary supplements.
  
  The Direct Selling Association reported in its 2019 Growth & Outlook Report that retail sales through the direct selling channel in the U.S. for 2018 grew in two of the industry’s largest product categories of wellness and services, representing 35.6% and 22.6% of retail sales respectively. Strong macro-economic metrics like the gross domestic product, overall retail sales, and consumer sentiment helped fuel direct sales growth in these key categories, as well the industry overall. In addition, the Direct Selling Association estimated direct selling retail sales in the U.S. were $35.4 million in 2018 and estimated growth of 1-3% per year through 2021.
 
  Commercial Coffee Segment. Our coffee segment includes coffee bean roasting, mill processing and the sales of green coffee beans. Our roasting facility, located in Miami, Florida, procures coffee primarily from Central America. Our green coffee business primarily procures coffee beans from Nicaragua by way of growing our own coffee beans and milling unprocessed green coffee beans that we will later purchase as processed green coffee beans. CLR sells coffee to domestic and international customers, both green and roasted coffee.
  
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) reported in its December 2019 Coffee: World Markets and Trade” report for 2019/2020 that world coffee production is forecasted to be 169.3 million bags, 5.3 million bags lower than the previous year. Global consumption for 2020 is forecasted at 166.4 million bags. The report further indicated that for 2020, Central America and Mexico are forecasted to contribute 19.1 million bags of coffee beans of which nearly half of the exports are destined to the European Union, followed by about one-third to the U.S. The U.S. imports the second-largest amount of coffee beans worldwide and is forecasted at 26.2 million bags in 2020, 1 million bags lower than last year.
  
  Commercial Hemp Segment. Our commercial hemp segment provides hemp extraction technology and equipment and related services to customers which enable them to extract CBD oils from hemp stock.
  
  The 2018 Farm Bill, as further discussed in the government regulations section below, brought immense change to the industrial hemp industry, legalizing the cultivation of hemp and opening opportunities for a brand-new CBD industry. With the move of hemp from the controlled substances list to an agricultural commodity, numerous companies entered the CBD space, including large retailers. The Hemp Industry Daily reported that CBD sales in the U.S. in 2019 were estimated at approximately $1.1 billion and would grow up to $7.5 billion by 2023, a compounded annual growth rate of over 46%.
  
  Competition
  
  Direct Selling Segment. The diet fitness and health food industries, as well as the food and drink industries in general, are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and subject to constant change. The number of competitors in the overall diet, fitness, health food, and nutraceutical industries is virtually endless. We believe that existing industry competitors are likely to continue to expand their product offerings. Moreover, because there are few, if any, substantial barriers to entry, we expect that new competitors are likely to enter the “functional foods” and nutraceutical markets and attempt to market “functional food” or nutraceutical coffee products similar to our products, which would result in greater competition. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in this extremely competitive market.
  
 
   
-12-



 
 
  We face competition from competing products in each of our lines of business, in both the domestic and international markets. Worldwide, we compete against products sold to consumers by other direct selling and direct sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing competition in our developing and emerging markets.
  
  Within the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis, with our direct selling competitors. There are also a number of direct selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which also have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. We compete against large and well-known companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments such as General Foods and Nestlé. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell in narrower product lines sold through retail establishments. This industry is highly competitive, and some of our principal competitors in the industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. We have many competitors in the highly competitive energy drink, skin care and cosmetic, coffee, pet line and pharmacy card industries globally, including retail establishments, principally department stores, and specialty retailers, and direct-mail companies specializing in these products. Our largest direct sales competitors are Herbalife, Amway, USANA and NuSkin. In the energy drink market, we compete with companies such as Red Bull, Gatorade and Rock Star. Our beauty, skin care and cosmetic products compete with Avon and Bare Essentials. From time to time, we need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures or to maintain our position in the marketplace. Such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. Any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices when raw material costs increase, would harm profit margins and, if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, our results of operations would suffer.
  
  We are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing distributors. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining distributors. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining distributors will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for distributors, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing distributors or deplete the pool of potential distributors in a given market.
  
  Commercial Coffee Segment. With respect to our coffee products, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label or generic products that generally are sold at lower prices. Consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to maintain consumer confidence that our products are of a higher quality and provide greater value than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, then consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. If we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors in specialty coffee, including by developing and maintaining our brands, or our competitors adopt our strategies, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales of specialty coffee, and accordingly our profitability, may be materially adversely affected.
  
  Commercial Hemp Segment. The market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Competition within the CBD industry is intense with many well-established companies within the market and numerous start-up companies entering the market. We believe we compete based upon the quality of our products and through our competitive advantage of providing field-to-finish products and services. We expect that the quantity and composition of the competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures and new customers enter the marketplace.
  
  Government Regulations
  
  The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the USDA, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, result in current product being sold within those markets, to be barred from importation into those markets that may significantly decrease revenues and increase costs within, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs in all three of our segments. Additionally, regulatory agencies within international markets may require the Company adhere to local market registration requirements for our products that may require reformulation, labeling and warehousing controls to be established for those products that may also significantly decrease revenues or increase costs.

  The FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use, as well as CBD with the passage of the Farm Bill as further described below). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a “health claim.” Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.
  
  With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
  
  Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly.
  
  These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. 
  
  In December 2018, the Farm Bill became law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it is no longer an illegal substance under federal law. In October 2019, the USDA published its interim final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which allows hemp to be grown and processed legally in the U.S. and is legal to transport in interstate commerce. Although this interim final rule became effective on the date of publication, it is still subject to comment and there is a possibility it will be modified from its current application.
  
  The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
  
  In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.

  We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
  
  There are an increasing number of laws and regulations being promulgated by the U.S. government, governments of individual states and governments overseas that pertain to the Internet and doing business online. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. Laws or regulations have been or may be adopted with respect to the Internet relating to:
  
 
● | liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | online content regulation; 
● | commercial e-mail; 
● | visitor privacy; and 
● | taxation and quality of products and services. 


 
  Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as:
  
 
● | intellectual property ownership and infringement; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | consumer protection; 
● | obscenity; 
● | defamation; 
● | employment and labor; 
● | the protection of minors; 
● | health information; and 
● | personal privacy and the use of personally identifiable information.


 
  This area is uncertain and developing. Any new legislation or regulation or the application or interpretation of existing laws may have an adverse effect on our business. Even if our activities are not restricted by any new legislation, the cost of compliance may become burdensome, especially as different jurisdictions adopt different approaches to regulation.
  
  We are also subject to laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation, recognition, and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting additional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and or do not involve legitimate products. Complying with these rules and regulations can be difficult and requires the devotion of significant resources on our part.
  
  Management Information, Internet and Telecommunication Systems
  
  The ability to efficiently manage distribution, compensation, inventory control, and communication functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success.
  
  We continue to upgrade systems and introduce new technologies to facilitate our continued growth and support of independent distributor activities. These systems include: (i) an internal network server that manages user accounts, print and file sharing, firewall management, and wide area network connectivity; (ii) a leading brand database server to manage sensitive transactional data, corporate accounting and sales information; (iii) a centralized host computer supporting our customized order processing, fulfillment, and independent distributor management software; (iv) a standardized telecommunication switch and system; (v) a hosted independent distributor website system designed specifically for network marketing and direct selling companies; and (vi) procedures to perform daily and weekly backups with both onsite and offsite storage of backups.
  
  Our technology systems provide key financial and operating data for management, timely and accurate product ordering, commission payment processing, inventory management and detailed independent distributor records. Additionally, these systems deliver real-time business management, reporting and communications tools to assist in retaining and developing our sales leaders and independent distributors. We intend to continue to invest in our technology systems in order to strengthen our operating infrastructure.

  Product Returns
  
  Product returns as a percentage of our net sales have been less than 2% of our annual net sales over the last two years. Our return policy in the direct selling segment provides that customers and distributors may return to us any products purchased within 30 days of their initial order for a full refund. Product damaged during shipment is replaced. Commercial coffee segment sales are only returnable if defective. Our hemp segment has minimal returns, if products are returned for quality assurances, the product will be corrected to the customers’ expectations.
  
  Human Capital/Employees
  
  At December 31, 2019, we had 415 employees worldwide. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, we believe our current personnel can meet our operating requirements in the near term. We expect that as our business grows, we may hire additional personnel to handle the increased demands on our operations and to handle some of the services that are currently being outsourced, such as brand management and sales efforts. As of May 31, 2021, we had 388 full time employees and 4 part time employees. Of the employees 315 work in our direct selling segment, 46 work in our coffee segment and 31 work in our Hemp segment.
  
  Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
  
  Emerging Growth Company
  
 At December 31, 2018, we were no longer an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012 (the “Jobs Act”). However, during 2018 we were an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018. Under the Jobs Act a company should be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
  
  (a)
  the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;

 
  (b)
  the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement;

 
  (c)
  the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, during the previous three-year period, issued; or

 
  (d)
  the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer.

 
  As an emerging growth company, we were subject to reduced public company reporting requirements and were exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
  
  As an emerging growth company, we were also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act which require the shareholder approval, on an advisory basis, of executive compensation and golden parachutes.
  
  We elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allowed us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as presented in this Annual Report, are in compliance with the public company effective dates.
  
  Corporate Transactions
  
  In June 2017, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation became effective which effectuated: (i) a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock; (ii) a decrease in the number of shares of (a) common stock authorized from 600,000,000 to 50,000,000 and (b) preferred stock authorized from 100,000,000 to 5,000,000.
  
  On July 11, 2011, AL Global Corporation, a privately held California corporation (“AL Global”), merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution Coffee Company, a publicly traded Florida corporation (“Javalution”). After the merger, Javalution reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Youngevity International, Inc.  In connection with this merger, CLR, which had been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Javalution prior to the merger, continued to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the public company.  AL Global Corporation was founded in 1996.
