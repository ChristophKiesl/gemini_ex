Item 1. Business
​
We are a leading diversified metal solutions provider and the largest metals service center company in North America (U.S. and Canada), serving our customers for more than 80 years. Through a network of approximately 300 locations in 40 U.S. states and in 13 countries outside the U.S., Reliance provides value-added metals processing services and distributes a full line of over 100,000 metal products, including alloy, aluminum, brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium and specialty steel products, to more than 125,000 customers in a broad range of industries. We focus on small orders with quick turnaround and increasing levels of value-added processing. We have made significant investments in our businesses in recent years, including investments in advanced, start-of-the-art value-added processing equipment to better service our customers that has led significant improvements in our gross profit margin and pretax income margin. 
​
In 2020, our results included net sales of $8.81 billion, net income attributable to Reliance of $369.1 million, earnings per diluted share of $5.66. Our 2020 operating results were materially and adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite the challenging operating environment, we generated a record annual gross profit margin of 31.5% while our tons sold and average selling price per ton sold declined 10.8% and 9.6%, respectively. Our strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion declined 9.9% from our record cash flow from operations in 2019 of $1.30 billion. We believe the strength and resiliency of our business model is demonstrated by our ability to generate strong gross profit margins and cash flow during periods of both increasing and declining metals pricing and economic strength and weakness.
​
We have made significant investments in our business through nearly $1 billion of capital expenditures over the past five years. In 2020, we performed value-added processing on 49% of the orders we shipped, significantly higher than our historical rate of approximately 40%. These significant investments have expanded our value added processing capabilities that our managers in the field have successfully leveraged to increase the percentage of our orders with value added processing, which has significantly contributed to our record gross profit margin of 31.5% that is 640 basis points higher than our gross profit margin of 25.1% in 2014. Our average order size in 2020 was $1,910 and approximately 40% of our orders were delivered within 24 hours from receipt of the order. 
​
Reliance has a proud heritage and demonstrated commitment to ethical business practices, sustainability and community engagement. 
​
Our primary business strategy is to provide the highest levels of quality and service to our customers in the most efficient operational manner, allowing us to maximize our financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer and geographic diversification. We continue to increase the proportion of our total sales that come from higher margin orders generated by our value-added metal processing capabilities (including toll processing) that we continue to expand, which can reduce the volatility in our profitability ratios during periods of unfavorable metals demand and/or pricing. We focus on improving the operating performance at acquired locations by integrating them into our operational model and providing them access to capital and other resources to promote growth and efficiencies. We believe our focused growth strategy of diversifying our products, customers and geographic locations and increasing the level of value-added services we provide our customers makes us less vulnerable to regional or industry-specific economic volatility and somewhat lessens the negative impact of volatility experienced in commodity pricing and cyclicality of our customer end markets, as well as general economic trends. We also believe that our focus on servicing customers with small order sizes and quick turnaround, along with our growth and diversification strategy have been instrumental in our ability to produce industry-leading operating results among publicly traded metals service center companies in North America. 
​
We have one operating segment and one reportable segment — metals service centers. Further information about our reportable segment, including geographic information, appears in Note 18 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Industry Overview
​
Metals service centers acquire carbon steel, aluminum, stainless and alloy steel and other metal products from primary metals producers, which we also refer to as mills, and then process these materials to meet customer specifications using techniques such as beam, bar, pipe and tube cutting; bending, forming and shaping; coil and flat roll processing; plate and sheet cutting; machining and various other specialized services such as laser cutting, fabricating, and electropolishing, among others. As a distributor and “first-stage” processor of metal products, our operations, by their nature, have a limited environmental impact as we do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. 
​
Customers purchase from service centers for a variety of reasons, including the ability to obtain value-added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size, and quality control. Many customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum order sizes specified by mills or because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular periods. Metals service centers respond to a niche market created because of the focus on when-needed inventory management and materials management outsourcing in the capital goods and related industries. In general, metals service center customers have placed increased emphasis on carrying lower amounts of inventory, especially during declining price environments. We believe that many customers have also reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us. We believe that such customer practices benefit metals services centers and we have invested significantly in innovative, state-of-the-art processing equipment in recent years. These investments have increased our ability to raise our selling prices and increase our gross profit margins as we provide higher quality products and increase the efficiency of our customers’ manufacturing operations. 
​
The processing services we provide save our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs. Specialized metals processing equipment requires high utilization to be cost effective. Many manufacturers and their suppliers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations. Accordingly, we believe industry dynamics have created a niche in the market for metals service centers. Metals service centers purchase, process, and deliver metals to end-users in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than the end-user could achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Service centers comprise the largest customer group for North American mills, buying and reselling almost 50% of all the carbon, alloy, stainless and specialty steels, aluminum, copper, brass, bronze and superalloys produced in the United States according to a September 2020 report on the metals wholesaling industry issued by IBISWorld Inc., a global intelligence publication.
​
We believe that metals service centers are generally less susceptible to market cycles than metals producers because service centers are generally able to pass on all or a portion of increases in metal costs to their customers, unless they are selling to their customers on a fixed-price contractual basis. We believe that we are generally less vulnerable to changing metals prices than the metals producers due to our minimal contract sales and emphasis on rapid inventory turnover. However, fluctuations in metals pricing have a significant impact on our revenue and profit.
​
The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive within localized areas or regions. Many of our competitors operate single, stand-alone service centers. According to IBISWorld Inc., there were approximately 9,400 metal wholesaling locations operated by approximately 6,800 companies in the United States in 2020. The significant number of metals service centers that exist in this fragmented market creates opportunities for us to expand by making acquisitions.
​
According to IBISWorld Inc.’s September 2020 report, the United States metals wholesale industry (which includes metals service centers) is expected to generate revenues of $188.58 billion in 2020, a decrease of 19.8% from 2019 revenues of $235.16 billion, due to declines in metal prices and demand. We believe that the decline in metals pricing is mainly attributable to the impacts on demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The four largest U.S. metals service center companies are expected by IBISWorld Inc. to represent less than 10% of the estimated $188.58 billion industry total in 2020. While we remain the largest metals service center company in the United States on a revenue basis, our 2020 U.S. revenues of $8.18 billion represented only about 4.3% of the entire U.S. market based on IBISWorld Inc.’s estimated 2020 industry revenues, leaving significant opportunity for further strategic growth within the industry.

History and Overview of Reliance
​
In 2019, we celebrated our 80th year in business since our original organization as a California corporation on February 3, 1939, operating a single metals service center in Los Angeles, California fabricating steel reinforcing bar. Within ten years of our founding, our metals service center had become a full-line distributor of steel and aluminum. In the early 1950s, we automated our materials handling operations and began to provide processing services to meet our customers’ requirements. In the 1960s, we began to acquire other companies to establish additional service centers, expanding into other geographic areas.
​
In the mid-1970s, we began to establish specialty metals centers stocked with inventories of selected metals such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass and copper, and equipped with automated materials handling and precision cutting equipment specific to the selected metals. In the mid-1990s, we began to expand nationally and continued to focus on acquiring well-run, profitable metals service center companies, and we continue to expand our network, with a focus on providing increased levels of value-added services and specialty products to our customers as opposed to merely distributing metal. We reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “RS” and was first traded on September 16, 1994.
​
We continue to execute our growth strategy and have become the largest North American (U.S. and Canada) metals service center company based on revenues, with approximately 300 locations and 2020 net sales of $8.81 billion. We continue to expand the types of metals that we sell and the processing services that we perform. We currently operate metals service centers under the following trade names:

Operational Strategy
​
Our executive officers maintain a control environment that is focused on integrity and ethical behavior. In addition, our executive officers establish policies, financial controls and operating guidelines, monitor performance, provide oversight and promote adherence to policies, guidelines and financial controls, while our division managers and subsidiary officers have autonomy with respect to day-to-day operations. This balanced yet entrepreneurial management style has enabled us to improve our safety performance and the productivity and profitability of both our acquired businesses and 

5



of our existing operations. Key management personnel are eligible for incentive compensation based, in part, on the profitability of their particular division or subsidiary and, in part, on the Company’s overall profitability.
​
Safety is our top priority and an important element of our culture and day-to-day operational focus. Our executive team supports a safety management system that includes policies, standard practices and goals at our facilities, including: (i) conducting regular safety assessments; (ii) monitoring best practices and compliance with regulatory requirements; (iii) integrating video-based safety programs into substantially all Company owned trucks; and (iv) including safety performance in compensation decisions. In addition, our safety professionals monitor compliance with regulatory requirements and conduct safety assessments and training to improve safety practices. Through these actions and initiatives, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019.
​
We seek to increase profitability through continuous improvements in our customer service, operational efficiencies, pricing discipline, innovation and inventory management as well as by providing increased levels of value-added processing. We continue to adjust our business practices to leverage our size and gain efficiencies which contribute to our profitability. We believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry and are known for our integrity, strong employee relations and the quality and timeliness of our service.
​
Historically, we have expanded through both acquisitions and internal growth. Since our initial public offering in September 1994, we have successfully purchased 67 businesses. Our capital expenditure budgets have been at historically high levels in recent years. Our 2021 capital expenditure budget is $245 million; however we expect our 2021 actual capital expenditures will be higher due to additional spending on projects carried forward from our 2020 budget. Our capital expenditures have consisted of opening new facilities, adding to our processing capabilities, upgrading processing equipment, relocating existing operations to larger, more operationally efficient facilities, improving the safety and energy efficiency of our operating facilities and enhancing the working environments of our employees. Our investments in processing equipment have allowed us to increase the range of value-added services that we provide to our customers, which we believe has contributed to the recent increases in our gross profit margin. We believe these significant investments differentiate us from our competitors. We expect to continue growing our business through acquisitions and internal growth initiatives, particularly those that diversify our products, customer base and geographic locations and increase our sales of high-margin specialty products and value-added processing services.
​
Customers and Markets
​
We have more than 125,000 customers in a variety of industries, including general manufacturing, non-residential construction (including infrastructure), transportation (rail, truck trailer and shipbuilding), aerospace and defense, energy (oil and natural gas), electronics and semiconductor fabrication, and heavy industry (agricultural, construction and mining equipment). We also service the auto industry, primarily through our toll processing operations where we process the metal for a fee, without taking ownership of the metal.
​
Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturer customers, the majority of our sales are to small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently. Our metals service centers wrote and delivered over 4,603,000 orders during 2020 or an average of 18,190 per day, with an average price of approximately $1,910 per order. Most of our metals service center customers are located within a 200-mile radius of the Reliance metals service center serving them. The proximity of our service centers to our customers helps reduce total road miles and carbon emissions, promote efficient routing and provide quick delivery. With our fleet of approximately 1,670 trucks (some of which are leased), we are able to service many smaller customers and provide quick turnaround deliveries. We believe that maintaining our own fleet of trucks and drivers provides a competitive advantage in the current environment as third-party freight costs have been at elevated levels in recent years. Moreover, our order entry systems and flexible production scheduling enable us to meet customer requirements for short lead times and quick delivery, when needed. In 2020, approximately 98% of our orders were from repeat customers. We believe that our long-term relationships with many of our customers significantly contribute to the success of our business. Providing prompt and efficient services and quality products at reasonable prices are important factors in maintaining and expanding these relationships.
​

We have built and opened international locations in recent years to service specific industries, typically making limited investments to support existing key U.S. customers that also operate in those international markets. Accordingly, our exposure to risks associated with such investments is minimal. Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated 2020 net sales, or $631.2 million. However, our net sales to international customers (based on the shipping destination) were approximately 9% of our consolidated 2020 net sales or $834.7 million, with approximately 25% of our international sales, or $206.4 million, to Canadian customers. 
​
Customer demand changes from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. Because we sell to a wide variety of customers in a wide variety of industries, we believe that we are able to somewhat mitigate earnings volatility. In addition, many of our customers are small job shops and fabricators who also have a diverse customer base and the versatility to service different end markets when an existing market slows. Given our business model and focus on small, quick turnaround orders, we primarily operate in the spot market for both the purchase and sale of our products. As we have limited contractual business, this enables us to better pass on higher metal prices to our customers and maintain consistency in our gross profit margin. 
​
Due to our focus on small orders, decentralized operating structure and the diversity of the markets we serve, customer concentrations are not significant. Our largest customer represented only 0.9% of our net sales in 2020. In 2020, we generated sales greater than $25 million from only 13 customers. 
​
The geographic breakout of our sales based on the location of our metals service center facilities in each of the three years ended December 31 was as follows:

​
Human Capital
​
At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 12,800 persons worldwide, of which approximately 11,500 were employed in the United States. Our total workforce of approximately 13,200 persons at December 31, 2020 includes approximately 400 contract and temporary workers. During the second quarter of 2020, we experienced significantly decreased demand in nearly all of the end markets we serve as a result of customer shut-downs and project delays attributable to COVID-19. In response to such reduced demand, we made workforce reductions and furloughed employees when practicable. As demand increased following the reopening of our customers’ facilities during the year, we were very pleased to recall the majority of our furloughed workforce.
​
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 12% of our employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with 40 union locals at 51 of our locations. These collective bargaining agreements have not had a material impact on our revenues or profitability at our various locations. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for renegotiation. Approximately 700 employees are covered by 25 different collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2021.

We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and wellness of our employees, their families and the communities in which we live and do business. We work to equip our employees with the knowledge, skills and resources to safely conduct our business and develop in their careers. A highlight of our commitment to our employees is the inclusion of “People” as one of our six core values that represent key areas of focus for our company. For more information on the Company’s core values, see the Company’s Code of Conduct available at investor.rsac.com. Among the critical elements included in the People category are the following:
​

● | Focus on Safety: The safety of our employees is our top priority and an important element of our day-to-day operational focus. In 2017, Reliance launched the SMART Safety program, which focuses on embedding our culture of safety across all of our operations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Rooted in our fundamental commitment to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, their families and the communities in which we live and do business, we leveraged the core values of our culture of safety to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: 
​

o | We implemented new, supplemental safety protocols and procedures to promote health and safety and increase awareness including temperature monitoring, physical distancing and wearing of face coverings in the workplace, enhanced cleaning, sanitation and hygiene practices and detailed contact tracing procedures to identify and isolate potential exposures within the workplace. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We developed and implemented policies and procedures based on new health and safety regulations and standards issued by federal, state and local government agencies as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We engaged an M.D. consultant to obtain professional medical advice about the virus and to inform our efforts to reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure to our employees, subcontractors and customers in and beyond the workplace.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We leveraged technology and embraced remote work where feasible, and modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions within and without our facilities. We significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities, internal meetings and our annual meeting of stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We invested in new technologies such as touchless thermal temperature screening devices and contact tracing wristbands to increase safe behavior and mitigate the spread of the virus in our operating facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We encouraged our employees to stay home if they did not feel well or might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus. We adopted policies to address exclusion from the workplace due to COVID-19 illness or known or suspected exposure, and stringent return to work protocols.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We implemented a special COVID-19 aid policy providing paid leave for employees impacted by the virus.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: We believe that superior Company performance requires contributions from a diverse workforce that includes a variety of employee experiences, backgrounds, and characteristics. We are committed to providing fair and unbiased opportunities and hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is also reinforced by the Code of Conduct, which forbids employment discrimination or harassment based on race, color, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions), national origin, religion, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Employee Wellness: The health and wellness of our employees are critical to our success. We are committed to providing our employees with resources to help them achieve their personal health, wellness, and wellbeing goals. As part of our comprehensive benefits offering, we provide employees and their covered spouses/domestic partners with on-site health screenings, individualized assessments and personalized wellness coaching.

addition to online and local resources, this one-on-one program integrates phone and mail-based communications and is designed to support employees' physical and mental health by providing individualized tools and coaching resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Compensation and Benefits: To help attract and retain the best employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits. In addition to base salaries, our compensation programs can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts. We believe that we provide industry-leading healthcare benefits to our employees and fund approximately 89% of the costs associated with our U.S. employees’ health insurance coverage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Community Service: Reliance is committed to investing in and enriching the communities in which we live and work. Giving back to those in need and enriching people's lives is a deep-rooted philosophy ingrained in our corporate culture that extends to our employees around the world, including by: (i) supporting local charities by matching certain fundraising efforts of our subsidiaries and divisions; and (ii) supporting non-profit organizations that provide veterans and transitioning armed services members with advanced manufacturing training. Our dedication to each and every member of our Family of Companies is the foundation for “Reliance Cares,” our emergency assistance fund dedicated to supporting employees impacted by natural disasters. Through employee funded contributions, matched dollar-for-dollar by Reliance, we have been able to provide 380 grants to employees (including over 140 grants to support employees and their families responding to COVID-19 related personal impacts) since the inception of Reliance Cares in 2017.

​
Suppliers
​
We primarily purchase our inventory from the major domestic metals producers. We do, however, also purchase limited amounts of certain products from foreign producers. We have multiple suppliers for all of our products. 
​
Because of our total volume of purchases and our long-term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers. We believe that these relationships provide us an advantage in our ability to source product and have it available for our customers in accelerated timeframes when needed, and also allows us to more efficiently manage our inventory. In the second quarter of 2020, our suppliers supported our efforts to rightsize our inventory following COVID-19-related shutdowns and project delays and provided us an uninterrupted supply of high-quality metal products during the fourth quarter of 2020 when conditions decreased the availability of some products in the marketplace. We believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier for our metal inventory. We believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers continue to be important because mill consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers.
​
Backlog
​
Because of the when-needed delivery and the short lead-time nature of our business, we do not believe information on our backlog of orders is meaningful to an understanding of our business.
​
Capital Expenditures
​
We maintained our focus on internal growth in 2020 by opening new facilities, building or expanding existing facilities, adding processing equipment, improving the safety of our operations and enhancing the working environments of our employees with capital expenditures of $172.0 million, the majority of which were growth-related. Our 2021 capital expenditure budget is $245 million; however we expect our 2021 actual capital expenditures will be higher due to additional spending on projects carried forward from our 2020 budget. The majority of our capital expenditure budget consists of opening new facilities, adding to our processing capabilities, upgrading processing equipment, and improving the energy efficiency of our operating facilities. The amount of our capital expenditure budget reflects our confidence in our long-term prospects; however, we will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project and consider the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment. We estimate our annual maintenance capital expenditures at approximately $80 to $90 million, which allows us to significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions

warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation and provides flexibility to redirect capital to other strategic priorities. 
​
Products and Processing Services
​
We provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ specifications and deliver products to fabricators, manufacturers and other end users. In recent years, we have made significant investments to enhance our toll processing and value-added metal processing capabilities. We maintain a wide variety of products in inventory, and believe this differentiates us from all other North American service centers. Approximately 40% of our orders were delivered within 24 hours from receipt of the order. This provides a competitive advantage to us, and, for the remainder of our orders we typically have shorter lead times than our competitors given our decentralized structure and investments in processing equipment. Our product mix has become more diverse mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to acquire companies that distribute mainly specialty products and provide increased levels of value-added processing services. We have made significant capital expenditure investments that have totaled nearly $1 billion over the past five years. In 2020, we performed value-added processing on 49% of the orders we shipped, significantly higher than our historical rate of approximately 40%. These significant investments have expanded our value added processing capabilities that our managers in the field have successfully leveraged to increase the percentage of our orders with value added processing, which has significantly contributed to our record gross profit margin of 31.5% that is 640 basis points higher than our gross profit margin of 25.1% in 2014. We believe our investments in state-of-the-art equipment and advanced technology coupled with our focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services were significant contributors to the substantial increases in gross profit margin over the past several years. We also believe increasing the proportion of our total sales that come from higher margin orders generated by our value-added metal processing capabilities (including toll-processing) that we continue to expand can reduce the volatility in our profitability ratios during periods of unfavorable metals demand and/or pricing.

​
We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification.
​
For sheet and coil products, we purchase coiled metal from primary producers in the form of a continuous sheet, typically 36 to 60 inches wide, between 0.015 and 0.25 inches thick, and rolled into 3-to-20 ton coils. The size and weight of these coils require specialized equipment to move and process the material into smaller sizes and various products. Many of the other products that we carry also require specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes or the capital available to acquire the necessary equipment.
​
We believe that few metals service centers offer the broad range of processing services and metals that we provide. In addition to a focus on growing our revenues from specialty products, we have also increased the amount of value-added 

11



processing services we provide through recent acquisitions and significant investments in new equipment over the past few years. 
​
After receiving an order, we enter it into one of our order entry systems, select appropriate inventory and schedule processing to meet the specified delivery date. In 2020, we delivered approximately 40% of our orders within 24 hours of the customer placing the order with us. We attempt to maximize the yield from the various metals that we process by combining customer orders to use each product that we purchase to the fullest extent practicable.
​
In 2020, we performed processing services for approximately 49% of our sales orders. Our primary processing services range from cutting, leveling or sawing to more complex processes such as machining or electropolishing. Throughout our service centers we perform most processes available in the marketplace, without encroaching upon the services performed by our customers. Consistent with our growth strategy, we continue to increase our offering of higher-margin value-added services, including certain fabrication processes in select geographic areas at the request of our customers.
​
We generally only process specific metals to non-standard sizes pursuant to customer purchase order specifications. In addition, we typically acquire standard size and grade products that can be processed into many different sizes to meet the needs of many different customers. We do not maintain a significant inventory of finished products, but we carry a wide range of metals to meet our customers’ short lead time and when-needed delivery requirements. Our metals service centers maintain inventory and equipment selected to meet the needs of that facility’s customers. We work with our customers to understand their needs and identify areas where we can provide additional value, increasing our importance to them.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,800 sales personnel. We believe that our sales force has extensive product, service, market and customer knowledge. Sales personnel are organized by division or subsidiary and are divided into two groups. Outside sales personnel travel throughout a specified geographic territory and maintain relationships with our existing customers and develop new customers. Inside sales personnel remain at the facilities to price and write orders. Outside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit from their particular geographic territories. Inside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit and/or pretax income of their particular location. 
​
Our business is relationship-based and because of that, we operate under many different trade names. We acquire well-run businesses with strong customer relationships and solid reputations within the marketplace. Because of this, we find value in the acquired trade name and continue to use the business name and maintain the customer relationships.
​
Competition
​
The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations, and competition is most frequently local or regional. Our domestic service center competitors are generally smaller than we are, but we also face strong competition from national, regional and local independent metals distributors and the producers themselves, some of which have greater resources than we do. 
​
We compete with other companies on price, service, quality, processing capability and availability of products and services. We maintain relationships with our major suppliers at the executive and local levels. We believe that this division of responsibility has increased our ability to obtain competitive prices of metals by leveraging our total size and to provide more responsive service to our customers by allowing our local management teams to make the purchasing decisions. In addition, we believe that the size of our inventory, the diversity of metals products we have available, and the wide variety of processing services we provide distinguish us from our competition. We believe our competitors are generally unable to offer the same high-quality products and services we provide using state-of-the-art equipment and advanced technology as they do not have the financial ability or risk tolerance to grow their businesses at the same rate as Reliance. We believe our industry-leading financial results in recent years were due to our strong financial condition, the high quality of products and services we are able to offer as a result of our significant investments in our acquired businesses, facilities and equipment, as well as our continued focus on small order sizes with quick turnaround.

​
Quality Control
​
Procuring high-quality metal from suppliers on a consistent basis is critical to our business. We have instituted strict quality control measures to assure that the quality of purchased raw materials will enable us to meet our customers’ specifications and to reduce the costs of production interruptions. In certain instances, we perform physical and chemical analyses on selected raw materials, typically through a third-party testing lab, to verify that mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness and surface characteristics meet our requirements and our customers’ specifications. We also conduct certain analyses of surface characteristics on selected processed metal before delivery to the customer. We believe that maintaining high standards for accepting metals ultimately results in reduced return rates from our customers.
​
We maintain various quality certifications throughout our operations. Approximately 50% of our operating locations have earned International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9001:2015) certifications. Many of our locations maintain additional certifications specific to the industries they serve, such as aerospace, auto, nuclear, and others, including certain international certifications.
​
Government Regulation
​
Our operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state and local requirements to protect the environment, including hazardous waste disposal and underground storage tank regulations. Our policy is to comply with all such requirements and regulations. The only hazardous substances that we generally use in our operations are lubricants, cleaning solvents and diesel for fueling our trucks. We pay state-certified private companies to haul and dispose of the limited amounts of hazardous waste our operations produce. Beyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
​
Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and related regulations, which, among other requirements, establish noise, dust and safety standards. We maintain comprehensive health and safety policies and encourage our employees to follow established safety practices. Safety of our employees and others is critical to our success. We continue to expand and improve our internal safety resources, which has contributed positively to our safety metrics and financial results. We encourage social well-being by instituting these high-quality labor, health and safety standards. 
​
We are subject to the conflict mineral provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. We are required to undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether the products we sell originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We verify with our suppliers the origins of all metals used in our products.
​
We sell metals to foreign customers and otherwise operate abroad, subjecting us to various countries’ trade regulations concerning the import and export of materials and finished products. Our operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace, including the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010. We have developed and implemented company-wide export and anti-corruption policies designed to provide our employees clear statements of our compliance requirements and to ensure compliance with applicable export and anti-corruption regulations. For information about risks related to government regulation, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Item 1A. “Risk Factors” including the Risk Factors captioned “We are subject to various environmental, employee safety and health, and customs and export laws and regulations, which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures;” “We operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations;” and “Our international operations continue to expand, exposing us to additional risks.”

Environmental
​
We are committed to mitigating the impact that our products and operations may have on the environment. As a distributor and “first-stage” processor of metal products, our operations, by their nature, have a limited environmental impact as we do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. 
​
Our operations involve steel and aluminum, which are inherently sustainable products, as they (i) are some of the most commonly-recycled materials in the United States and (ii) can be 100% recycled without loss of quality. We believe steel, one of our most significant products, is the most recycled material on the planet—more than plastic, paper, and glass combined each year. In 2020, we reintroduced over 430 million pounds of recycled scrap material into the manufacturing life cycle.
​
We continue to evaluate and implement energy conservation and other initiatives to reduce pollution and our environmental impact. Enactment of more stringent environmental regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
​
Some of the properties we own or lease are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use. We may incur some environmental liabilities because of the location of these properties. In addition, we are currently involved with a certain environmental remediation project related to activities at former manufacturing operations of Earle M. Jorgensen Company (“EMJ”), our wholly owned subsidiary, that were sold many years prior to our acquisition of EMJ in 2006. Although the potential cleanup costs could be significant, EMJ maintained insurance policies during the time they owned the manufacturing operations that have covered substantially all of our expenditures related to this matter to date, and are expected to continue to cover the majority of the related costs. We do not expect that these obligations will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
​
Seasonality
​
Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. Our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends as a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from holidays observed by the Company as well as vacation and extended holiday closures at some of our customers. The number of shipping days in each quarter also has a significant impact on our quarterly sales and profitability. Particularly in light of COVID-19, we cannot predict whether period-to-period fluctuations will be consistent with historical patterns. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results.
