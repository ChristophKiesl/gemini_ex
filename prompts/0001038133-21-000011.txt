See Note 3 to the financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for related party and acquisition disclosures. 
HeskaView and Heska’s Data Capture Utility (DCU) are modern and intuitively operated practice information software applications for point of care devices. The HeskaView software can be used as independent practice information reporting software for Heska analyzers. HeskaView and the DCU can be used as a middleware to bi-directionally connect Heska’s analyzers to a wide variety of Veterinary Practice Management Software platforms used throughout North America. 
scil vIP® is a modern and intuitively operated practice information software for point of care devices. The software can be used as independent practice information software or as middleware to connect POC equipment throughout Europe. It further provides a web interface allowing the users to access the software even more easily.
Point of Care Heartworm Diagnostic Tests
Heartworm infections of dogs and cats are caused by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis. This parasitic worm is transmitted in larval form to dogs and cats through the bite of an infected mosquito. Larvae develop into adult worms that live in the pulmonary arteries and heart of the host, where they can cause serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease. Our canine and feline heartworm diagnostic tests use monoclonal antibodies or a recombinant heartworm antigen, respectively, to detect heartworm antigens or antibodies circulating in the blood of an infected animal.
Heartworm Preventive Products
We have an agreement with Merck Animal Health, a unit of Merck & Co., Inc., granting Merck Animal Health the exclusive distribution and marketing rights for our canine heartworm prevention product, Tri-Heart® Plus Chewable Tablets, ultimately sold to or through veterinarians in the U.S. Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablets (ivermectin/pyrantel) are indicated for use as a monthly preventive treatment of canine heartworm infection and for treatment and control of ascarid and hookworm infections. We manufacture Tri-Heart Plus Chewable Tablets at our Des Moines, Iowa production facility.
Allergy Products and Services
Allergy is common in companion animals. Clinical symptoms of allergy are variable, but are often manifested as persistent and serious skin disease in dogs and cats. Clinical management of allergic disease is problematic, as there are a large number of allergens that may give rise to these conditions. Although skin testing is often regarded as the most accurate diagnostic procedure, such tests can be painful, subjective and inconvenient. The effectiveness of the immunotherapy that is prescribed to treat symptoms of allergic disease is inherently limited by inaccuracies in the diagnostic process.

We believe that our ALLERCEPT®  Definitive Allergen Panels provide the most accurate determination of which we are aware of the specific allergens to which an animal, such as a dog, cat or horse, is reacting. The panels use a highly specific recombinant version of the natural IgE receptor to test the serum of potentially allergic animals for IgE directed against a panel of known allergens. A typical test panel consists primarily of various pollen, grass, mold, insect and mite allergens. The test results serve as the basis for prescription ALLERCEPT® Therapy Shots and ALLERCEPT® Therapy Drops. We operate veterinary laboratories in Loveland, Colorado and Fribourg, Switzerland which both offer blood testing using our ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels.
We sell kits to conduct blood testing using our ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels to third party veterinary diagnostic laboratories outside of the U.S. We also sell products to screen for the presence of allergen-specific IgE to these customers. Animals testing positive for allergen-specific IgE using these screening tests are candidates for further evaluation using our ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels.
Veterinarians who use our ALLERCEPT® Definitive Allergen Panels often purchase our ALLERCEPT® Therapy Shots or ALLERCEPT® Therapy Drops. These prescription immunotherapy treatment sets are formulated specifically for each allergic animal and contain only the allergens to which the animal has significant levels of IgE antibodies. The prescription formulations are administered in a series of subcutaneous injections (Shots) or by daily sublingual (under the tongue) administration (Drops), with doses increasing over several months, to ameliorate the allergic condition of the animal. Immunotherapy is generally continued for an extended time. We offer canine, feline and equine subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy treatment products. We believe our ALLERCEPT® Therapy Drops offer a convenient alternative to subcutaneous injection, thereby increasing the likelihood of pet owner compliance.
Other Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals ("OVP")
We developed a line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). In January 2015, we signed a long-term Master Supply Agreement related to these vaccines with Eli Lilly operating through Elanco. 
We manufacture biological and pharmaceutical products for a number of other animal health companies. We manufacture products for animals other than cattle including horses, pigs, chickens, cats and dogs. Our offerings range from providing complete turnkey services which include research, licensing, production, labeling and packaging of products to providing any one of these services as needed by our customers as well as validation support and distribution services.
Marketing, Sales and Customer Support
We currently market our products to veterinarians through an outside field organization, a telephone sales force and independent third-party distributors, as well as through trade shows, print advertising and through other distribution relationships, such as Merck Animal Health in the case of our heartworm preventive. As of December 31, 2020, our customer facing sales, installed base support and utilization organization consisted of 144 and 124 individuals in various parts of our North America and International segments, respectively.
Veterinarians may obtain our products directly from us or indirectly through others. All of our products ultimately are sold primarily to or through veterinarians. The acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success. Internationally, we market our products to veterinarians primarily through third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third party distributors, but through our recent acquisitions of scil, Optomed and CVM, and organic efforts in Australia, we have begun to market directly. 
-6-


We have a staff dedicated to customer and product support including veterinarians, technical support specialists and service technicians. Individuals from our product development group may also be used as a resource in responding to certain product inquiries.
All OVP products are marketed and sold by third-parties under third-party labels.
We grant third parties rights to our intellectual property as well as our products, with our compensation often taking the form of royalties and/or milestone payments.
Manufacturing
The majority of our revenue is from proprietary products manufactured by third parties. Third parties manufacture our veterinary instruments, including affiliated consumables and supplies, as well as other products including key components of our heartworm point-of-care diagnostic tests. 
Our facility in Des Moines, Iowa is a USDA, Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") licensed biological and pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. This facility currently has the capacity to manufacture more than 50 million doses of vaccine each year. We expect that we will, for the foreseeable future, manufacture most, or all of our pharmaceutical and biological products at this facility, as well as most, or all, of our recombinant proteins and other proprietary reagents for our diagnostic tests. We currently manufacture our canine heartworm prevention product, our allergy treatment products and all our OVP products at this facility.
The OVP products for our North America segment are purchased in both finished and bulk format, and we perform all phases of manufacturing, including growth of the active bacterial and viral agents, sterile filling, lyophilization and packaging at this facility. We manufacture our various allergy products at our Des Moines facility, our Loveland facility and our Fribourg facility. We believe the raw materials for most of the products we manufacture are readily available from more than one source.
Product Development
We are committed to providing innovative products to address the health needs of companion animals. We may obtain such products from external sources, external collaboration or internal research and development.
We are committed to identifying external product opportunities and creating business and technical collaborations that lead to high value veterinary products. We believe that our active participation in scientific networks and our reputation for investing in research enhances our ability to acquire external product opportunities. We have collaborated, and intend to continue to do so, with a number of companies and universities. 
Internal research and development is managed on a case-by-case basis. We employ individuals with expertise in various applicable areas and will form multidisciplinary product-associated teams as appropriate. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights represent opportunities to grow our business and maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. The proprietary technologies of our OVP products are primarily protected through trade secret protection of, for example, our manufacturing processes in this area.
-7-


We actively seek patent protection both in the U.S. and abroad. Our issued patent portfolios primarily relate to allergy, diagnostic and detection tests, and vaccine delivery technologies. As of December 31, 2020, we owned, co-owned or had rights to 5 issued U.S. patents expiring at various dates from April 2021 to April 2024 and had 2 pending U.S. patent application. Our corresponding foreign patent portfolio as of December 31, 2020 included 7 issued patents in various foreign countries expiring at various dates from February 2021 to August 2024 and no pending applications.
We also have obtained exclusive and non-exclusive licenses for numerous other patents held by academic institutions and for-profit companies.
Seasonality
While we do not experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our sales throughout the year, we generally experience higher sales in the fourth quarter due to industry trade shows and other similar activities.
Government Regulation
Although the majority of our revenue is from the sale of unregulated items, many of our products or products that we may develop are, or may be, subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., including the USDA and the FDA and by similar agencies in other countries. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. Satisfaction of these requirements can take several years to achieve and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approval or clearances, if required, before it may be marketed in a particular country. The following summarizes the major U.S. government agencies that regulate animal health products:
•USDA.  Vaccines and certain single use, point-of-care diagnostics are considered veterinary biologics and are therefore regulated by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CVB, of the USDA. In contrast to vaccines, single use, point-of-care diagnostics can typically be licensed by the USDA in about two years, at considerably less cost. However, vaccines or diagnostics that use innovative materials, such as those resulting from recombinant DNA technology, usually require additional time to license. The USDA licensing process involves the submission of several data packages. These packages include information on how the product will be manufactured, information on the efficacy and safety of the product in laboratory and target animal studies and information on performance of the product in field conditions.
•FDA.  Pharmaceutical products, which typically include synthetic compounds, are approved and monitored by the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the same statutory standard for FDA approval applies to both human and animal drugs: demonstrated safety, efficacy and compliance with FDA manufacturing standards. However, unlike human drugs, neither preclinical studies nor a sequential phase system of studies are required. Rather, for animal drugs, studies for safety and efficacy may be conducted immediately in the species for which the drug is intended. Thus, there is no required phased evaluation of drug performance, and the Center for Veterinary Medicine will review data at appropriate times in the drug development process. The time and cost for developing companion animal drugs may be significantly less than for drugs for livestock animals, which generally have enhanced standards designed to ensure safety in the food chain.
-8-


•EPA.  Products that are applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA.
After we have received regulatory licensing or approval for our products, numerous regulatory requirements typically apply. Among the conditions for certain regulatory approvals is the requirement that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices or other manufacturing regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as maintenance of records and documentation. The USDA, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities strictly enforce manufacturing regulatory requirements through periodic inspections and/or reports.
A number of our animal health products are not regulated. For example, certain products such as our ALLERCEPT® panels are not regulated by either the USDA or FDA. Similarly, none of our veterinary instruments requires regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the U.S.
We have pursued CE Marking for imaging equipment and regulatory approval outside the U.S. based on market demographics of foreign countries. For marketing outside the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing regulatory licensing and approval for many of our products. Licensing and approval by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before we can market products in those countries. Product licensing approval processes and requirements vary from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required in the U.S. We cannot be certain that approval of any of our products in one country will result in approvals in any other country.
To date, we or our distributors have sought regulatory approval for certain of our products from the Canadian Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CCVB (Canada); the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, or MAFF (Japan); the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, or ADAFF (Australia); the Republic of South Africa Department of Agriculture, or RSADA (South Africa); the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, or ADCD (Hong Kong); the Macau Animal Health Division of Animal Control and Inspection, or IACM (Macau); the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and from the relevant regulatory authorities in certain other countries requiring such approval.
The heartworm and allergy products previously discussed which have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and/or elsewhere are summarized below:

Customer Concentration
The information concerning our significant customers included in our Risk Factors section of this Annual Report under the caption “The loss of significant customers who, for example, are historically large purchasers or who are considered leaders in their field could damage our business and financial results” is incorporated herein by reference thereto.
Competition
Our market is intensely competitive. Our competitors include independent animal health companies and major pharmaceutical companies that have animal health divisions. We also compete with independent, third party distributors, including distributors who sell products under their own private labels. In the Point of Care diagnostic testing market, our major competitors include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX") and Zoetis Inc. ("Zoetis"). Idexx has a larger veterinary product and service offering than we do and a large sales infrastructure network and a well-established brand name. Zoetis also has a large sales infrastructure network.
In our North America segment, the OVP products we manufacture for sale by third parties compete with similar products offered by a number of other companies, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources than us and may have more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. Companies with a significant presence in the animal health market such as CEVA Santé Animale, Elanco, Merck, Sanofi, Vétoquinol S.A., Virbac S.A. and Zoetis may be marketing or developing products that compete with our products or would compete with them if successfully developed. These and other competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. Our competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we do.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our product development activities and manufacturing of our biological, pharmaceutical, diagnostic and detection products, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
-10-


Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 602 persons, 360 of which resided in North America and 242 internationally. We employ temporary workers on a need only basis to maintain business flexibility and a dynamic workforce. We are committed to employee diversity and inclusion and the support of traditionally underrepresented groups in management. Our workforce is approximately 50% women and 50% men with 40% of our management team (defined as Director, Vice President and Executive Vice President) represented by women. In 2020, we experienced an employee turnover rate of approximately 13% globally. 
We believe that the current and future success of our company’s ability to execute on its strategic initiatives is highly dependent upon our ability to recruit, retain and reward our employees. We engage in targeted recruitment strategies to fill highly skilled positions. Our employees enjoy competitive compensation plans including market rate targeted salaries, robust benefits including retirement plans and employee stock purchase plan opportunities, and the opportunity for participation in short and long term incentive programs. Our compensation philosophy is designed to provide an appealing, market-based and rewarding compensation program that encourages high personal and company performance, strong cultural and ethical behavior, and incentives aligned with shareholder interests. Our aim is to attract, engage and retain highly qualified, motivated, and creative people who will fulfill our mission to be the “voice of the pet,” while delivering on Heska goals in a healthy, honest, and sustainable manner.
We are committed to providing a workplace that protects the health and well-being of our employees. All employees are required to abide by our Code of Conduct and Ethics, company health and safety parameters and contribute to a positive and friendly company culture. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in consideration of our employees’ safety, in March 2020, we implemented strict work from home policies for all employees with the ability to work remotely at all of our locations. At our Des Moines, Iowa manufacturing facility, we instituted staggered start times, designated building entry/exit protocols and closed common areas to maximize “social distancing” guidelines. As of December 31, 2020, we continue to enforce these safety precautions and abide by Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) guidelines, while tentatively planning limited return to work procedures in the second half of 2021.
Our Chief Administrative Officer is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy and updates the Board on human capital matters.
