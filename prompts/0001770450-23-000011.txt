Item 1. Business 
Xerox is a workplace technology company, building and integrating software and hardware for enterprises large and small. As customers seek to manage information and document workflows across digital and physical platforms, we deliver a seamless, secure and sustainable experience. Whether inventing the copier, the Ethernet, the laser printer or more, Xerox has long defined the modern work experience and continues to do so with investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR)-driven service experiences, robotic process automation (RPA) and other technologies that enable Xerox to deliver essential products and services to address productivity challenges of a hybrid workplace and distributed workforce. 
Xerox serves customers globally in North America, Central and South America, Brazil, Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, Africa and India. This geographic span allows us to deliver our technology and solutions to customers of all sizes, regardless of complexity or number of customer locations. 
Recent Changes and Developments
In 2022, we made progress in our efforts to monetize or improve and broaden the financial profile of two of the businesses we stood up in 2021: FITTLE (formerly known as Xerox Financial Services) and Innovation (PARC).
FITTLE focused its strategy in 2022 to broaden its portfolio of financed assets to include growth opportunities independent of Xerox equipment and services, such as the expansion of its dealer relationships to include an increasing number of non-Xerox dealers, leveraging its existing dealer relationships to finance a wider breadth of products and forming relationships with new vendors. In 2022, FITTLE’s non-captive (i.e., indirect) originations grew more than 20%. In December, FITTLE entered into a receivables funding solution (the Receivables Funding Agreement) with an affiliate of HPS Investment Partners to sell pools of future lease receivables, primarily covering U.S. direct leases (including leases originated through XBS) through January 2024. The Receivables Funding Agreement, which anticipates sales of approximately $600 million in 2023, represents a strategic shift in the Company’s approach to funding FITTLE’s growth, allowing FITTLE to focus on being an asset-light, best-in-class provider and servicer of equipment leases while freeing up Xerox’s operating cash. 
We also spun out two businesses incubated at PARC: Mojave, an energy efficient HVAC technology development business, and Novity, an industrial predictive maintenance business. Both companies were spun out as separate, independent businesses, with Xerox continuing to hold a noncontrolling minority share. The transactions allow Xerox to preserve free cash flow as Mojave and Novity invest for growth, all while maintaining the opportunity to realize value from their future success.
Due to recent adverse changes in macroeconomic and other operating conditions, we have recently taken a more focused approach to the way in which we allocate R&D spending, placing greater emphasis on margin-accretive growth opportunities with near-term returns. In 2022, we took actions to reduce and reallocate R&D spend toward projects and partnerships that augment our existing strengths and opportunities within Print, IT Services and Digital Services. As a result, we paused growth investments at Elem, our 3D printing business, we exited our infrastructure-monitoring joint venture, Eloque, and rationalized spending at PARC’s research facilities.
Strategic Priorities
Our long-term strategic objective is to grow the share of our customer's technology spending as well as the Total Addressable Market (TAM) through expanded penetration of existing solutions and the development of new, data-driven solutions. We believe Xerox’s globally recognizable brand, our deep understanding of clients’ industries and businesses and client trust have afforded us a path to win in IT and digital services – markets where we already have leading solutions and where we are actively investing to develop more.
Our strategic priorities for 2023 are: Customer Success, Focus on Profitability and Shareholder Returns.
Customer Success: We will take measures to make it easier to do business with Xerox by employing a holistic, client-centric approach to delivering essential products and services that address the productivity challenges of a hybrid workplace and distributed workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the workplace into a more flexible, hybrid environment. In response, we continue to invest in innovation to bolster and diversify our portfolio of offerings for hybrid workplace environments, including investments in Workflow Central and Digital Services such as Capture & Content and Customer Engagement Services, which enable work to flow seamlessly between the office and home. By focusing our sales efforts on providing solutions closely aligned to clients’ needs, rather than products, we believe we can grow our revenue while improving customer outcomes. 
Xerox 2022 Annual Report 



 
Focus on Profitability: We plan to implement a more flexible cost base and operating model to expand margins and direct investments towards margin-accretive growth opportunities with nearer-term returns. Project Own It delivered approximately $2.2 billion of gross cost savings from 2018 to 2022, and the behaviors and processes instilled by this program remain a priority. Just as we will focus on making it easier to do business with Xerox, we will look to make it easier to do business within Xerox by investing in processes that drive incremental organizational efficiencies and enable collaboration required to offer holistic solutions for our clients. 
Shareholder Returns: We will manage the business with the aim of optimizing free cash flow generation and return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. We expect to focus on driving higher profits, but we also remain focused on generating more cash flow per profit dollar. In 2022, FITTLE entered into a Receivables Funding Agreement that we expect to improve Xerox’s cash flow profile while continuing to support FITTLE’s growth and we also intend to concentrate on inventory efficiency, which we expect to improve as supply chain conditions normalize.
Acquisitions and Investments
We maintain a broad M&A pipeline that includes targets within the print industry and adjacent markets. In 2022, Xerox acquired Powerland, an IT service provider in Canada, and Go Inspire, a print and digital marketing and communication services provider in the U.K.
Further details about our acquisitions and investments can be found in Note 6 - Acquisitions and Investments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Reportable Segments and Geographic Sales Channels
Our business is organized to ensure we focus on efficiently managing operations while serving our customers and the markets in which we operate. We have two operating and reportable segments – Print and Other and Financing (FITTLE). 
•Print and Other – the design, development and sale of document management systems, solutions, and services as well as associated technology offerings including IT and software products and services.
•Financing (FITTLE) – a financing solutions business primarily providing financing for the sales of Xerox equipment and also non-Xerox office equipment and IT services equipment.
We also operate a matrix organization that includes a geographic focus that is primarily organized from a sales perspective on the basis of “go-to-market” (GTM) sales channels as follows:
•Americas, which includes our sales channels in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico, Brazil, and Central and South America.
•EMEA, which includes our sales channels in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India.
•Other, which primarily includes royalties and licensing revenue. 
These GTM sales channels are structured to serve a range of customers for our products and services, including financing. Accordingly, we will continue to provide information, primarily revenue related, with respect to our principal GTM sales channels. 
Please refer to the Reportable Segments section of Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 4 - Segment and Geographic Area Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Revenues
We have a broad and diverse base of customers by both geography and industry, ranging from small and mid-sized market clients to printing production companies, governmental entities, educational institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations. Our business does not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business spans four primary offering areas: Workplace Solutions, Production Solutions, Xerox Services and FITTLE.
Workplace Solutions is made up of two strategic product groups, Entry and Mid-Range, much of which share common solutions, apps and ConnectKey® software. Workplace Solutions revenues include the sale of products (captured primarily as equipment sales) as well as the supplies and associated technical service and financing of those products through FITTLE (captured as post sale revenue).
•Entry primarily comprises A4 desktop monochrome and color printers and multifunction printers (MFPs) ranging from small personal devices to office workgroup devices. We offer our ConnectKey® system of digital workflow and applications across a large portion of these devices.

Xerox 2022 Annual Report 



 
In addition to our four primary offering areas described above, a smaller but growing portion of our revenues comes from non-core streams including paper sales in our developing market countries, wide-format systems, licensing revenue, as well as standalone software such as CareAR, DocuShare® and XMPie. 
In addition, our PARC innovation group, which comprises the research efforts undertaken at our facilities located in Palo Alto, Calif.; Webster, N.Y.; Cary, N.C., and Toronto, Canada, is focused on incubating, productizing and commercializing disruptive technology.
Geographic Information
Overall, approximately 45% of our revenue is generated by customers outside the U.S. Additional details can be found in Note 4 - Segment and Geographic Area Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
In 2022, Xerox and its subsidiaries were awarded 266 U.S. utility and design patents. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and older patents expire. As of December 31, 2022, Xerox held 7,105 U.S. utility and design patents. These patents expire at various dates up to 20 years or more from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general no single patent is essential to our business. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages.
In 2022, we were party to multiple patent-related agreements in which we licensed or assigned our patents to others in return for revenue and/or access to their patents or to further our business goals. Most patent licenses expire concurrently with the expiration of the last patent identified in the license or after a specified term of years. We were also party to a number of cross-licensing agreements with companies that also hold substantial patent portfolios. These agreements vary in subject matter, scope, compensation, significance and duration.
In the U.S., we own approximately 161 U.S. trademarks, either registered or applied for. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal every 10 years. We vigorously enforce and protect our trademarks.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
At our core is a deep and long-lasting commitment to ESG, a pledge to inspire and support our people, conduct business ethically across the value chain and preserve our planet. This commitment stems from our corporate values established over sixty years ago, which include: succeeding through satisfied customers; delivering quality and excellence in all we do; requiring a premium return on assets; using technology to develop market leaders; valuing and empowering our employees; and behaving responsibly as a corporate citizen.
We continue this legacy by creating products and services that help our customers be more productive, profitable and sustainable. We deliver solutions that drive customer success and enable a new, better world. We do this in our own operations, as well as in workplaces, communities and cities around the world. We recognize the world’s challenges such as climate change and human rights and understand the role we play.
Our pledge to inspire and support our people, conduct business ethically and protect our planet remains at the core of everything we do. At Xerox, we believe in continuously improving, and we apply this mentality to ensuring we are always finding ways to improve the sustainability of our operations.
The Xerox 2022 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report describes our management approach related to ESG. Our work aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provide a framework to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. To ensure we are responsive to all stakeholders, Xerox has also been reporting in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate Change Related Disclosures (TCFD). (The 2022 CSR Report, SASB report and TCFD report are accessible at www.xerox.com/CSR. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference in this combined Form 10-K unless expressly noted.) 
Environment
With climate change being one of the defining issues of our time, we fast-tracked our net zero goal by 10 years to 2040 and integrated climate change-related risks and opportunities into our Enterprise Risk Management. We share our roadmap to reach net zero in our 2022 CSR Report. Our roadmap covers our full value chain and focuses on improving processes and energy efficiency as well as designing environmentally responsible products and clean technologies that extend beyond print. Our interim goal is to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions at least 60% by 2030, against the Company’s 2016 baseline. This is in line with the ambitious science-based global warming target, validated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our GHG emissions are

third-party assured in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2019 and are updated in our progress summary as new data becomes available. In 2022, Xerox was named to CDP’s Annual "A List” for climate change transparency and performance. CDP is a nonprofit organization that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, and regions to manage their environmental impacts.
Xerox has long paired its technology with sustainability, influencing not just our industry but others. Serving as an ENERGY STAR Charter Partner, Xerox helped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) create its standards and still works with the agency today. Since 1993, more than 500 Xerox® products have achieved ENERGY STAR registration. In 2022, 100% of our eligible new products have achieved ENERGY STAR and EPEAT registration. ENERGY STAR requirements serve as the foundation for other eco-labels such as Electronic Products Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) that is composed of criteria spanning corporate and product requirements. EPEAT product criteria combine comprehensive requirements for design, production, energy use, and recycling, with ongoing independent verification of manufacturer claims. 
Circular economy initiatives remain a part of our business strategy. Our first commercial product in 1959, the Xerox 914, introduced electronics remanufacturing long before the term “circular economy” became popular. Our vision was to transform Xerox manufacturing, operations, offices and facilities into waste-free workplaces. We had this same vision for our clients’ workplaces: a world where electronics and supplies at the end of their useful life would come full circle to become raw materials for tomorrow’s technology. In this model, quality and performance are not compromised, precious natural resources are conserved, and waste becomes obsolete. Six decades later, we continue to demonstrate that a circular economy delivers environmental, economic and societal benefits. To meet this commitment, we have developed several collection and waste reduction programs, while also designing technology to align with the circular economy’s key elements. The majority of spent toner cartridges and other consumables returned through Green World Alliance, Xerox's customer recycling program, are recycled, reused or remanufactured. We continue to make progress towards increasing the post-consumer recycled content in our eco-label eligible devices.
Social
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 20,500 employees; a reduction of approximately 2,800 (12.0%) employees since December 31, 2021. The reduction in headcount resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), restructuring, as well as the impact of organizational changes including employee transfers associated with shared services arrangements. 
On a geographic basis, approximately 10,300 employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 10,200 employees were located outside the U.S. We had approximately 11,900 employees or approximately 60% of our employees engaged in providing services to customers (direct service and managed services) and approximately 3,000 engaged in direct sales.
Approximately 20% of our employees are represented by unions or similar organizations, such as worker’s councils with approximately 90% located outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 25% of our employees were women and 30% of our U.S. employees self-identified as diverse.
Employee Safety
At Xerox, we are committed to maintaining a safe workplace environment for our people. We have an incident reporting process, workplace safety inspections and hazard analysis that allows improvements in areas where we can reduce or prevent incidents. Several methods are also used to raise employee safety awareness including site-specific hazard management, off-the-job safety information and communications regarding safety concerns. In 2022, Xerox’s Day Away from Work Case Injury Rate was 0.40, which was an 8.1% increase from the 2021 rate of 0.37, and better than the 2022 targeted rate of 0.44 by 9.1%.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
Diversity, inclusion and belonging (DIB) is more than in our DNA at Xerox, it connects us culturally. Our first CEO, Joseph Wilson, called for social responsibility, diversity and inclusion by shaping our core values to reflect on the value of our employees for races and ethnicities. After we reaffirmed our commitment to DIB in 2020, we have expanded our commitment to social responsibility and diversity through employee listening sessions to educate and to cultivate belonging. Joseph Wilson’s vision is still reflected today in our DIB roadmap through the development and execution of ESG targets. Our DIB roadmap continues to enable us to have a bigger impact on employees and society. To support this, our roadmap and our actions focuses on:
Xerox 2022 Annual Report 



 
•Diverse Pipeline: Recruit, hire and promote more women globally, and underrepresented talent within the U.S. for professional-level job roles. Our pipeline is governed by Xerox's diversity policy known as the Wilson Rule.
•Partnership: Build relationships with external organizations to increase the sourcing of incoming talent to better reflect the markets and communities we serve. For example, we are working with AI vendors using their unique algorithms to increase the pool of women and underrepresented candidates for our job openings.
•Culture Change: Leveled-up our culture cohesion by hosting organization-wide DIB learning events and listening sessions, and expansion of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to 10 groups. In 2022, we held our third annual global DIB virtual event, called All of Us Together. This global event is planned by members of our ERGs, and it is open to all Xerox employees. In addition to increasing global employee participation in ERGs, we expanded the footprint of our ERGs with the creation of our new disability ERG called Enable_All.
•Community Outreach: Fostering relationships with partners that reflect the communities that we serve is at the heart of our DIB roadmap. We continue to nurture our partnership with A Better Chance (ABC) and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute through mentorship, sponsorship, and scholarship support to youth of color, providing equality-opportunities for more successful career outcomes. In the U.K., we partner with the Black Young Professionals Network to mentor black professionals and provide career opportunities. 
•Accountability: Measuring our progress against our ESG metrics and continuing to be transparent by utilizing our CSR Report to inform the public about our strategy and progress. We are confident that over time, our efforts will yield sustainable progress in this critical business challenge. In 2022, we completed an assurance audit against the Social KPIs that confirmed the accuracy in the methodology.
Talent Management and Workforce Development
Talent management and workforce development are critical for the future of Xerox and fueling business growth and innovation. We use high-impact practices and technology to drive global workforce capability and integrate learning with work. Our organization and talent planning processes include reviews with business leaders to build our talent pipeline. More broadly, Human Resources (HR) provides a forum for management to review the future needs of the organization, noting strengths, gaps and strategies to build strong teams for the next chapter at Xerox. During our most recent organization and talent planning process, we identified the potential successors for critical roles. We utilize a third-party, online learning platform that is available to all Xerox employees for self-directed learning, which supports skill and career growth.
The Company is also committed to accelerating the careers of high-potential, diverse employees and women along with identifying more diverse candidates for open roles. For example, Vista, our high-potential development program, recently completed its second year, and we are preparing to launch the third cohort in early 2023. This is a one-year program that provides opportunities for our highest-potential employees across the globe, to accelerate their career development through education, experience, and exposure. This program also includes individualized career coaching, mentorship, and networking opportunities with Executive Committee and Senior Leadership members, which accelerates our talent pipeline, retains early talent, and increases employee engagement.
Additionally, our leaders embrace and support the Wilson Rule, which requires that one out of every three final candidates for professional roles be diverse. Finally, we provide ongoing diversity training sessions to managers to reinforce the importance of a diverse workforce.
Global Learning Innovation
We adopt a blended technology-led learning model to drive the Xerox business and talent strategies. Learning is delivered to our staff using an appropriate modality to support professional development and build capabilities across the company, on time, and in a cost-effective manner. Our Learning and Development (L&D) function is focused on business agility and driving digital transformation across our workforce. 
Our employees have access to a global learning platform that includes an extensive portfolio of online courses, virtual classroom events, simulations, job aids, and other learning and development resources. Learning topics include critical job-specific information and technical upskilling, management development and professional effectiveness, productivity tools for project management, client service, negotiations, technology solutions, ethics, diversity and inclusion, and information security. As our business evolves, we will continue to leverage technology to identify new skills or capabilities required to ensure we remain competitive in the global market. Our L&D function partners with Xerox business leaders to design capability-building programs and the Xerox senior leadership champions a long-term vision to continually develop the skills of our employees.

Total Rewards
Our success depends on attracting, retaining, and motivating a highly productive, global workforce. To achieve this, we take pride in offering our employees a comprehensive Total Rewards program that includes various compensation, benefits, and work-life programs. Our programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:
•Drive shareholder value: support our business strategy and culture.
•Align with performance: incentivize the right behaviors – when the Company wins, our employees win.
•Support our talent strategy: attract, retain and motivate a productive workforce.
As with most global companies, our compensation and benefits vary based on employee eligibility, and local practices and regulations. We benchmark our programs to ensure we remain competitive with our peers and the markets we serve, and to maintain alignment with our short-term and long-term business goals.
Our compensation offerings include base pay and short-term and long-term incentive programs. Our short-term programs include: a Management Incentive Plan (MIP), designed to drive Xerox’s pay for performance culture and incentivize our leaders to help Xerox achieve sustainable growth; sales compensation programs to tightly align our sales force with business goals; and a Profit Share Plan (PSP), designed to give a broad population of our employees an opportunity to share in the organization’s success. A Long-Term Incentive (LTI) equity-based program reinforces alignment of our leaders and key talent with shareholders.
Our benefit offerings provide our employees with choice and flexibility to help them reach their health and financial goals. Our offerings include the following core programs: health care, wellness, retirement, paid time off, life and disability insurance, and access to voluntary benefits.
Philanthropy and Community Involvement
From our earliest days as a company, Xerox has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to corporate social responsibility. Our greatest goal is to facilitate employee-driven philanthropy. Together, Xerox and our employees are creating real impact and sustainable change for the greater good. In 2022, Xerox employees volunteered for approximately 24,400 hours. 
Our efforts are focused on four strategic areas to maximize change: 
•Strong vibrant communities: Xerox invests in communities where our people and clients live and work, strengthening ties with our stakeholders and embedding Xerox into the fabric of communities around the world. We encourage our people to give back to the causes they believe in, by providing employees with a day each year to volunteer at a cause of their choice. Xerox also offers a limited employee match to certain charitable organizations.
•Education and workforce preparedness: Xerox supports the role of education in society - through colleges, universities, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education programs, and workforce development programs that prepare the next generation of leaders, inventors and scientists. 
•Science and technology: Xerox invests in scientific research and partnerships to serve the long-term strategic interests of the Company and our world. 
•Disaster relief: Xerox provides aid to our employees and their neighbors in crises during natural disasters.
Governance 
The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight for ESG. The Committee reviews significant shareholder relations issues and environmental and CSR matters, ensuring that our actions align with our core values and citizenship priorities. The CSR Council, comprised of senior executives who manage specific CSR topic areas, has centralized oversight of the Company’s management approach, including policies, goals, strategies and actions to drive progress. The primary mission of the CSR Council is to drive strategies with a client-centric impact, across Xerox globally, to advance our legacy of leadership in corporate citizenship. Actions taken must meet our stakeholders’ expectations, including customers, employees, investors, regulators and communities worldwide. 
We demonstrate our Board of Directors' and executive staff's commitment to ESG as follows:
•Investor outreach: Each year Xerox conducts regular outreach with our investors to facilitate candid discussions about our business and strategy. In 2022, the company hosted 25 calls and meetings with 12 different investors providing feedback about ESG reporting metrics, diversity, and executive compensation practices. We include ESG metrics in the compensation criteria for all senior management, which covers climate change, a balanced workforce, succession planning, board refreshment and workplace safety.
Xerox 2022 Annual Report 



 
•Investor Day: Xerox hosted an Investor Day Event in February 2022 - Now & Next - with our investors and analysts. During this event, Xerox executives provided an overview of the Company's strategic priorities, which included a discussion of ESG priorities such as our Roadmap to Net Zero, as well as discussed business solutions and financial services that make every day work better for clients.
Annual training regarding ethics, privacy, DIB and security are required of all our employees. Additional specialized training is required for certain roles and numerous training programs are available for employees to take on their own initiative. 
A variety of proprietary and leading industry security features are also used to protect Xerox® devices from malicious attacks. Xerox's robust security and education market solutions were recognized by KeyPoint Intelligence with the Buyers Lab (BLI) 2021-2022 PaceSetter Awards for Worldwide Document Imaging Security for Production and Office solutions, as well as for the Education Market in North America.
Xerox takes data protection very seriously. Xerox’s information security and privacy programs are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and are based on industry standards and best practices such as the National Institute of Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001. Xerox Privacy Policy notice ensures that the processing of personal data is based on the subject’s consent, as individuals have a right to withdraw or alter consent at any time for future processing. Please refer to Xerox’s privacy website at www.xerox.com/privacy for further information. (The content of our website is not incorporated by reference in this combined Form 10-K unless expressly noted.)
Adherence to our policies, and procedures governing data protection, is enforced through a combination of technical and manual safeguards over our systems and facilities, disciplinary actions against employees, audit rights and other contractual rights against our vendors. 
Material Government Regulations
Our business activities are worldwide and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Currently costs incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws and regulations applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. However, as a result of increased government focus in the U.S. and globally, we believe that environmental and global trade regulations could potentially materially impact our business in the future. 
For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, please see Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this combined Form 10-K.
Marketing and Distribution
We go to market with a customer-centric, market-informed and services-led approach, selling workplace products and services that support the new hybrid and distributed workforce. We sell directly to customers through our direct sales force or indirectly through distributors, independent agents, dealers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and e-commerce marketplaces. In addition, we continue to focus on broadening our footprint to sell offerings to the small and mid-sized markets primarily in the U.S., U.K. and Canada through XBS which is comprised of regional core companies that provide office technology and services, including Managed IT Services, to small and mid-sized markets clients, and through the acquisitions of dealers and IT Services providers internationally. 
We are structured to serve our customers globally through two primary go-to-market units: the Americas, comprised of the U.S. and Canada along with Mexico, Brazil, Central and South America; and EMEA, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India. We have an industry leading and common global delivery model that provides a consistent customer experience worldwide. We believe that this structure creates a leaner and more effective go-to-market model that streamlines our supply chain and provides our customers with best-in-class services. 
The Technology Agreement (TA) between FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. (formerly Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd, or Fuji Xerox) and Xerox was terminated on March 31, 2021. The TA included a provision that allowed Fuji Xerox continued use of the Xerox brand trademark for two years after the date of termination of the TA as it transitions to a new brand in exchange for an upfront prepaid fixed royalty of $100 million. Fuji Xerox elected to continue its use the Xerox brand trademark over the two-year period and, therefore, in April 2021, made the upfront payment due under the TA. Accordingly, we expect any potential entry by Xerox into the Fuji Xerox territory under the Xerox brand to be deferred to at least April 1, 2023.

The product supply agreements with Fuji Xerox will continue to be effective despite the termination of the TA, and Fuji Xerox and Xerox will continue to operate as each other's product supplier under existing or new purchase/supply agreements.
Competition
Although we encounter competition in all areas of our business, we are the leader - or among the leaders - in our core mid-range and high-end product groups. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand reputation, distribution, and customer service and support.
The larger competitors in our print business include Canon, FUJIFILM Business Innovations Corp., HP Inc., Konica Minolta and Ricoh. Our brand recognition, reputation for document management expertise, innovative technology and service delivery excellence are our competitive advantages. These advantages, combined with our breadth of product offerings, global distribution channels and customer relationships, position us as a strong competitor going forward. As we continue our strategy to diversify and grow other businesses, there may be additional non-print competitors.
With respect to our financing/FITTLE business, our main competitors vary considerably from equipment manufacturers with a captive leasing group to third-party independent leasing entities and financial institutions. We generally compete based on relationships with dealers and partners and by offering a better service experience. 
Customer Financing (FITTLE)
We finance a large portion of our direct channel customer purchases of Xerox equipment through bundled lease agreements. We also provide lease financing to end-user customers who purchase Xerox equipment through our indirect channels. We compete with other third-party leasing companies with respect to the lease financing provided to these end-user customers. In both instances, financing facilitates customer acquisition of Xerox technology and enhances our value proposition, while providing Xerox a reasonable return on our investment in this business. We also provide financing solutions for non-Xerox office equipment and IT services equipment. 
Because our lease contracts allow customers to pay for equipment over time rather than upfront upon installation, we maintain a certain level of debt to support our investment in these lease contracts. We fund our customer financing activity through a combination of cash generated from operations, cash on hand and proceeds from capital market offerings and securitizations through secured borrowing arrangements and sales of receivables. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $3.1 billion of finance receivables and $235 million of Equipment on operating leases, net, or Total Finance assets of approximately $3.3 billion. We maintain an assumed 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared to our Finance assets, which results in approximately $2.9 billion of our $3.7 billion of debt being allocated to FITTLE.
In December 2022, the Company entered into a Receivables Funding Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to offer for sale, and the purchaser agreed to purchase certain eligible pools of finance receivables on a monthly basis in transactions intended to be true sales. The Receivables Funding Agreement, which contemplates receivables sales totaling approximately $600 million, has an initial term through January 31, 2024, with automatic one-year extensions thereafter, unless terminated by either the Company or the purchaser. The Receivables Funding Agreement provides a committed funding source for FITTLE to originate and service new lease originations without incurring additional debt.

Manufacturing and Supply
Our manufacturing and distribution facilities are located around the world. Our largest manufacturing site is in Webster, N.Y., where we produce the Xerox® iGen, Xerox® Nuvera, and Xerox® Baltoro production printing presses as well as key components and consumables for our products, such as toner. We have manufacturing operations for materials and components in Dundalk, Ireland; Wilsonville, OR; Venray, Netherlands; Ontario, Canada; and Oklahoma City, OK. We conduct sustainable manufacturing in all of these facilities. In addition, we work with various manufacturing and distribution partners. This diversification of suppliers brings flexibility and cost efficiency to our manufacturing and supply chain, a critical component in our strategic initiative to optimize operations for simplicity. FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp. (formerly Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.) is our largest partner with whom we maintain product sourcing agreements for specific products across our entry, mid-range and high-end portfolios. We also acquire products from various third parties to increase the breadth of our product portfolio and meet channel requirements. In addition, we outsource certain specialized manufacturing activities to partners, such as Flex Ltd. and Jabil Inc., which are global contract manufacturers with whom we have long-standing relationships.

International Operations
The financial measures, by geographical area for 2022, 2021 and 2020, are included in Note 4 - Segment and Geographic Area Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also the risk factor entitled “The international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including foreign exchange and interest rate risk and unfavorable political, regulatory, and tax conditions in foreign countries.” in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this combined report on Form 10-K. 
Seasonality
Our revenues may be affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases and printing volume. These factors have historically resulted in lower revenues, operating profits and operating cash flows in the first and third quarters.
Backlog
Prior to 2021, backlog1 had not been a meaningful indicator of future business prospects because a significant proportion of our revenue was fulfilled from existing inventories or within a short period of order signing. Accordingly, our level of backlog remained fairly consistent period to period. However, starting in 2021, and continuing throughout the first three quarters of 2022, we experienced an unprecedented level of supply chain disruption, in part due the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which only began to meaningfully ease during the fourth quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, our backlog of equipment and IT hardware remains elevated as compared to our historic levels and was $246 million. In 2023, we expect backlog to continue to decline through the first half of the year as supply chain conditions further normalize.
_____________
(1)Order backlog is measured as the value of unfulfilled sales orders, shipped and non-shipped, received from our customers waiting to be
installed, including orders with future installation dates. It includes printing devices as well as IT hardware associated with our IT service offerings. Backlog at December 31, 2022 of $246 million excludes sales orders from Russia and Powerland Computers, Ltd., which was acquired in the first quarter of 2022.
