General Overview
Avadel Pharmaceuticals PLC (“Avadel,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in identifying, developing, and commercializing niche branded pharmaceutical products mainly in the U.S. Our business model consists of three distinct strategies: 

• | the development of differentiated, patent protected products through application of the Company’s proprietary patented drug delivery platforms, Micropump® and LiquiTime®, that target high-value solid and liquid oral and alternative dosages forms through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 505(b)(2) approval process, which allows a sponsor to submit an application that doesn’t depend on efficacy, safety, and toxicity data created by the sponsor. In addition to Micropump® and LiquiTime®, the Company has two other proprietary drug delivery platforms, Medusa™ (hydrogel depot technology for use with large molecules and peptides) and Trigger Lock™ (controlled release of opioid analgesics with potential abuse deterrent properties). 


• | the identification of Unapproved Marketed Drugs (“UMDs”), which are currently sold in the U.S., but unapproved by the FDA, and the pursuit of approval for these products via a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA). To date, the Company has received approvals through this “unapproved-to-approved” avenue for three products: Bloxiverz® (neostigmine methylsulfate injection), Vazculep® (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection) and Akovaz® (ephedrine sulfate injection). As a potential source of near-term revenue growth, Avadel is working on the development of a fourth product for potential NDA submission by year-end 2017, and seeks to identify additional product candidates for development with this strategy.


• | the acquisition of commercial and or late-stage products or businesses. The Company markets three branded pediatric-focused pharmaceutical products in the primary care space, and a 510(k) approved device that will launch in the second quarter of 2017, all of which were purchased through the acquisition of FSC Laboratories and FSC Pediatrics on February 5, 2016. We will consider further acquisitions, and the Company continues to look for assets that could fit strategically into its current or potential future commercial sales force.

Corporate Information
The Company was incorporated on December 1, 2015 as an Irish private limited company, and re-registered as an Irish public limited company, or plc, on November 21, 2016. Its principal place of business is located at Block 10-1, Blanchardstown Corporate Park, Ballycoolin, Dublin 15, Ireland. Its phone number is 011-353-1-485-1200, and its website is www.Avadel.com.
The Company is the successor to Flamel Technologies S.A., a French société anonyme (“Flamel”), as the result of the merger of Flamel with and into the Company which was completed at 11:59:59 p.m., Central Europe Time, on December 31, 2016 (the “Merger”) pursuant to the agreement between Flamel and Avadel entitled Common Draft Terms of Cross-Border Merger dated as of June 29, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”). Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Flamel. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, as a result of the Merger:

• | Flamel ceased to exist as a separate entity and the Company continued as the surviving entity and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Flamel.


• | our authorized share capital is $5,500 divided into 500,000,000 ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.01 each and 50,000,000 preferred shares with a nominal value of $0.01 each


◦ | all outstanding ordinary shares of Flamel, €0.122 nominal value per share, were canceled and exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company, $0.01 nominal value per share. This change in nominal value of our outstanding shares resulted in our reclassifying $5,937 on our balance sheet from ordinary shares to additional paid-in capital 


◦ | our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred shares on a non-pre-emptive basis, for a maximum period of five years, at which point it may be renewed by shareholders. The board of directors has discretion to dictate terms attached to the preferred shares, including voting, dividend, conversion rights, and priority relative to other classes of shares with respect to dividends and upon a liquidation.

-4-


• | all outstanding American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing ordinary shares of Flamel were canceled and exchanged on a one-for-one basis for ADSs representing ordinary shares of the Company.

Thus, the Merger changed the jurisdiction of our incorporation from France to Ireland, and an ordinary share of the Company held (either directly or represented by an ADS) immediately after the Merger continued to represent the same proportional interest in our equity owned by the holder of a share of Flamel immediately prior to the Merger.
References in these consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto to “Avadel,” the “Company,” “we,” "our," “us,” and similar terms shall be deemed to be references to Flamel prior to the completion of the Merger, unless the context otherwise requires.
Prior to completion of the Merger, the Flamel ADSs were listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “FLML”; and immediately after the Merger the Company’s ADSs were listed for and began trading on Nasdaq on January 3, 2017 under the trading symbol “AVDL.”
Further details about the reincorporation, the Merger and the Merger Agreement are contained in our definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 5, 2016, and elsewhere in this Item 1 under the caption “- The Flamel Merger.”
Under Irish law, the Company can only pay dividends and repurchase shares out of distributable reserves, as discussed further in the Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC as of July 5, 2016. Upon completion of the Merger, the Company did not have any distributable reserves. On February 15, 2017, the Company filed a petition with the High Court of Ireland seeking the court's confirmation of a reduction of the Company's share premium so that it can be treated as distributable reserves for the purposes of Irish law. On March 6, 2017, the High Court issued its order approving the reduction of the Company's share premium which can be treated as distributable reserves. 
The Company currently has four direct wholly owned operating subsidiaries: Avadel US Holdings, Inc., Flamel Ireland Limited, trading under the name Avadel Ireland, Avadel Investment Company Limited and Avadel France Holding SAS. Avadel US Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, and is the holding entity of Avadel Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc. (Formerly FSC Laboratories, Inc.), Avadel Legacy Pharmaceuticals, LLC (formerly Éclat Pharmaceuticals, LLC), Avadel Management Corporation, and Avadel Operations Company, Inc. Avadel Ireland is a corporation organized under the laws of Ireland and is where all intangible property was relocated on December 16, 2014. Avadel France Holding SAS is a société par actions simplifiée, organized under the laws of France and is the holding entity of Avadel Research SAS where the Company’s research and development activities take place. A complete list of the Company’s subsidiaries can be found in Exhibit 21.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Business Model
Our three development strategies allow us to develop and/or license or acquire differentiated branded products for FDA approval and commercialization, principally in the United States. The Company is currently able to self-fund most product development opportunities thereby having less reliance on partners. The Company has narrowed its drug delivery focus to center around the Micropump and LiquiTime platforms, and although it currently maintains ownership of Trigger Lock and Medusa, it will assess potential opportunities to divest or partner/license these technology platforms. 
Business Strengths and Strategies
Our business strengths and strategies include:

• | Continued Development of our Drug Delivery Technologies: Our versatile, proprietary drug delivery platforms (Micropump®, LiquiTime®, Trigger Lock™, Medusa™) allow us to select unique product development opportunities, representing either “life cycle” opportunities, whereby additional intellectual property (IP) can be added to a pharmaceutical to extend the commercial viability of a product, for marketed chemical and biological drugs (via 505(b)(2) approval), or innovative formulation opportunities for new chemical entities (NCE) or new biological entities (NBE) (via NDA regulatory path). Several products formulated using our proprietary drug delivery platforms are currently under various stages of development. These products will be marketed either by the Company and/or by partners via licensing/distribution agreements (see “- Other Products Under Development - Proprietary pipeline to deliver several regulatory filings (US and/or EU) through 2018”) in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 


• | Continued exploration and development of additional unapproved to approved drug products: Our unapproved to approved drug development process may provide us with near term revenue growth and provide cash flows that can be used to fund R&D and inorganic initiatives. 

-5-


• | Inorganic growth through Acquisitions and/or Partnerships: The Company maintains a strong balance sheet with substantial liquidity and no long-term debt with fixed maturities. The Company intends to explore and pursue appropriate inorganic growth opportunities that complement its drug delivery platforms or to acquire proprietary products that enhance profitability and cash flow. This goal was evidenced in early 2016 with the acquisition of FSC Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, specialty pharmaceutical companies which focus on the commercialization of pediatric products and devices. The acquisition of the FSC companies adds to our marketing and licensing knowledge of commercial processes in the U.S, which we believe enhances our ability to identify potential product candidates for development, leverages new opportunities for the application of our drug delivery platforms, and establishes a commercial footprint to license and market products in the U.S. 


• | Divestitures and out licensing: We intend to narrow our focus to our two most developed drug delivery platforms, Micropump® and LiquiTime®, and plan to divest or out-license Trigger Lock™, for abuse deterrence, and Medusa™, for extended-release subcutaneous injection. We believe the Trigger Lock™ and Medusa™ platforms are robust and well protected from an IP standpoint; however, their development and FDA approval may require investments in clinical work and infrastructure which we are not currently prepared to support. In 2015, the Company entered into a transaction in which it granted Elan Pharma International Limited an exclusive U.S. license to use the Company’s LiquiTime technology for Over-the-Counter ("OTC") products.

Developments in 2016 and 2017
On February 8, 2016, we acquired FSC Holdings, LLC, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries FSC Pediatrics, Inc., FSC Therapeutics, LLC, and FSC Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, "FSC"), from Deerfield CSF, LLC, an affiliate of Deerfield Management, one of the Company’s major shareholders. FSC was a Charlotte, NC-based specialty pharmaceutical company that markets three pediatric pharmaceutical products indicated for infection, allergy, gastroesophageal disease (GERD), and a medical device for the administration of aerosolized medication using pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers (pMDIs) for the treatment of asthma. Under the terms of the acquisition, Avadel will pay $21,250 over a five-year period to Deerfield for all of its equity interests in FSC Holdings. Specifically, Avadel will pay $1,050 annually for five years and will make a final payment in January 2021 of $15,000. Avadel will also pay Deerfield a 15% royalty per annum on net sales of the current FSC products, up to $12,500 for a period not exceeding ten years. 
On March 31, 2016, we submitted a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) to the FDA for a Phase III clinical trial of FT218, Avadel’s once-nightly formulation of sodium oxybate for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients suffering from narcolepsy. 
In May 2016, the FDA approved our NDA for Akovaz on its PDUFA date of April 30, 2016. Akovaz is the Company’s third UMD product and is the first NDA for ephedrine sulfate injection to be approved in the U.S. 
In August 2016, we launched our third UMD product, Akovaz, into a market of approximately 7.5 million vials per year, representing the Company’s largest market opportunity to date. 
In October 2016, we reached an agreement with the FDA for our SPA for our Phase III REST-ON trial to assess the safety and efficacy of FT218, a once-nightly Micropump-based formulation of sodium oxybate, for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. 
During December 2016, the first patient enrolled in our REST-ON study was dosed. 
Lead Products 
Bloxiverz® (neostigmine methylsulfate injection), Bloxiverz’s NDA was filed on July 31, 2012. Bloxiverz, was approved by the FDA on May 31, 2013 and was launched in July 2013. Bloxiverz is a drug used intravenously in the operating room for the reversal of the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery. Bloxiverz was the first FDA-approved version of neostigmine methylsulfate. Today, neostigmine is the most frequently used product for the reversal of the effects of other agents used for neuromuscular blocks. There are approximately four million vials sold annually in the U.S. On January 8, 2015 and December 28, 2015, the FDA approved the NDA submitted by Fresenius Kabi USA (“Fresenius”) for neostigmine methylsulfate (for both 0.5 mg/1mL and 1 mg/1mL strengths) and an ANDA submitted by Eurohealth International, an affiliate of West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., neostigmine methylsulfate (for both 0.5 mg/1mL and 1 mg/1mL strengths), respectively. In 2016, we recognized total revenues of $82,896 for this product. (for more details, see “- Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In the future, sales of Bloxiverz is dependent upon the competitive market dynamics between Avadel, Fresenius, West-Ward and any subsequent ANDA approvals that may occur. Additionally, an alternative product marketed by Merck, Bridion (sugammadex), was approved in early 2016 and has taken approximately 30% of the neostigmine market away through early February 2017.

Vazculep® (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection) On June 28, 2013, the Company filed an NDA for Vazculep (phenylephrine hydrochloride injection). The product was approved by the FDA on June 27, 2014 and is indicated for the treatment of clinically important hypotension occurring in the setting of anesthesia. We started shipping Vazculep (in 1mL single use vials, and 5mL and 10mL pharmacy bulk package vials) to wholesalers in October 2014. There are approximately 7 million vials sold annually in the U.S. Vazculep is the only FDA-approved version of phenylephrine hydrochloride to be available in all three vial sizes. West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“West Ward”) commercializes the 1mL single-dose vial, as an approved product in the U.S. In 2016, we recognized total revenues of $39,796 for this product. The volume of sales of Vazculep is dependent upon the competitive landscape in the marketplace.
Akovaz® (ephedrine sulfate injection). On June 30, 2015, the Company announced its third NDA was accepted by the FDA, and was granted approval for Akovaz on April 29, 2016. On August 12, 2016, we launched Akovaz, into a market of approximately 7.5 million vials annually in the U.S. The Company was the first approved formulation of ephedrine sulfate, an alpha- and beta- adrenergic agonist and a norepinephrine-releasing agent that is indicated for the treatment of clinically important hypotension occurring in the setting of anesthesia. Avadel began shipping the product to wholesalers in August 2016 in cartons of twenty-five 50 mg/mL 1mL single use vials. During 2016 Akovaz was the only FDA approved version of ephedrine sulfate being commercially sold in the U.S. In 2016, we recognized total revenues of $16,831 for this product. On January 27, 2017, Endo International plc’s (NASDAQ: ENDP) subsidiary Par Pharmaceuticals, received NDA approval for ephedrine sulfate, packaged in cartons of twenty-five 50mg/mL, 1mL single use vials. On March 2, 2017, Akorn Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: AKRX) received FDA approval for its ampule presentation. We expect this market to remain a three-player market.
Karbinal™ER (carbinoxamine maleate extended-release oral suspension). Karbinal ER is an H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine) indicated for children two years of age and older, is the only first generation extended release oral suspension antihistamine available in U.S. Karbinal ER provides physicians with a new, effective and easy to use treatment option for children with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis that need symptomatic relief for runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose or throat and itchy and watery eyes. Karbinal ER was launched in 2015 and is exclusively licensed from Tris Pharma.
AcipHex® Sprinkle™ (rabeprazole sodium). AcipHex Sprinkle is a delayed-release capsule, in dosages of 5 mg and 10 mg, indicated for the treatment of GERD in children 1 to 11 years of age for up to 12 weeks. AcipHex Sprinkle can be sprinkled on a small amount of soft food (e.g., applesauce, fruit or vegetable based baby food, or yogurt) or the capsule granules can be emptied into a small amount of liquid (e.g., infant formula, apple juice, or pediatric electrolyte solution). The U.S. marketing rights for this product were acquired from Eisai Inc. and the product was launched in 2015.
Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, 125 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL and 375 mg/5 mL. Cefaclor is indicated for the treatment of otitis media, lower respiratory infections, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, urinary tract infections, and skin structure infections, caused by susceptible organisms. It is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat certain infections, caused by susceptible bacteria. Our Cefaclor offering was launched in 2015.
Flexichamber®. Flexichamber, a prescription medical device, is a collapsible holding chamber for use by patients under the care or treatment of a licensed healthcare professional to administer aerosolized medication from most pressurized Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI). Flexichamber is comprised of antistatic materials to help improve delivery of medication from MDIs to the patient, while minimizing the adherence of the medication to the walls of the chamber. Flexichamber can be used with or without a mask. The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for Flexichamber in October 2014 and the product is expected to produce revenues by the end of the first quarter 2017 and will be actively promoted by our sales force at the onset of the second quarter 2017. 
Other Products Under Development
FT218 is Avadel’s Micropump-based formulation of sodium oxybate. Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous compound and metabolite of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It has been described as a therapeutic agent with high medical value; in Europe and the United States it is currently approved in a twice nightly formulation indicated for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy at doses up to 9g/night. In December 2016, the Company initiated patient enrollment and dosing for its REST-ON Phase III clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of its once nightly formulation of FT218 for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy in patients suffering from narcolepsy. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 264 patients being conducted in 50 - 60 clinical sites in the U.S., Canada and western Europe. The Company expects enrollment to be completed by year end 2017. In preparation for its REST-ON trial, Avadel sought and consequently reached an agreement with the FDA for the design and planned analysis of its study through a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). An SPA is an acknowledgement by the FDA that the design and planned analysis of a pivotal clinical trial adequately addresses the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission. Should the trial reach its primary endpoints of EDS and cataplexy, the Company believes an SPA agreement with the FDA should help to mitigate several risks associated with receiving approval, such as any questions surrounding statistical powering.

Any additional studies, such as pivotal pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, needed for a New Drug Application (NDA) approval, will be run simultaneously, with the trial completion targeted for the first half of 2018. The study provides the potential to demonstrate improved efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction over the standard of care, JAZZ’s Xyrem®, a twice nightly sodium oxybate formulation, which is expected to generate revenues of between $1.1 and $1.125 billion in 2016.
We entered into an Exclusive License Agreement on September 30, 2015, with Elan Pharma International Limited, a subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc, for the U.S. rights to our LiquiTime drug delivery platform for the U.S. (OTC) drug market. Under the multi-product license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $6,000 and will be eligible for at least an additional $50,000 in approval and launch milestones. In addition, once commercialized we will receive mid-single digit royalties on net sales of the products. Avadel and Elan believe there is a large market opportunity for other OTC extended release liquid drug formulations, including products containing active ingredient combinations for the US cough/cold market, which analysts have estimated between $6 billion to $8 billion annually.
Avadel currently has four undisclosed products using the Micropump and LiquiTime technologies in proof of concept. These products are focused in the pediatric, psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic areas
Hydromorphone. Avadel also has a Trigger Lock-based abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral hydromorphone product (FT227) in development. Hydromorphone is used for relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring [continuous] around-the-clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time. We announced in June 2015, positive results from two pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in healthy volunteers of FT227. The PK studies were intended to provide sufficient data for the Company to select a preferred prototype formulation to move forward into pivotal studies. The studies compared three FT227 prototypes to the comparator product Jurnista© (sold as Exalgo© in the United States) in both fasted and fed conditions at a dose of 32mg. Under fasted conditions, comparing the AUC and the Cmax of FT227 to Jurnista in 16 subjects, the results identified a FT227 formulation that met the bioequivalence criteria for both parameters. Under fed conditions (14 subjects), the same formulation was bioequivalent in terms of AUC to Jurnista but outside of the Cmax bioequivalence criterion at the lower confidence interval level. Comparing the effect of food on the PK parameters of the FT227 prototypes across the two studies, no notable difference is seen in either AUC or Cmax in fed and fasted conditions. This suggests that administration of FT227 will not be subject to a clinically relevant food effect. In both studies FT227 was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. In addition, Avadel has generated substantial in vitro data comparing the abuse deterrence properties of FT227 compared to other marketed abuse-deterrent opioid products. The Company believes that Trigger Lock is a robust platform for opioids that will set a high standard in terms of abuse deterrence. Further in vitro data have been generated on FT227 by an independent contract research organization which confirmed the effective abuse deterrent properties of the product. FT227 is designed to be filed as a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA). In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company completed an alcohol interaction study, and will continue to seek out a licensing partner and or complete divestiture of the Trigger Lock platform. Avadel is currently seeking to divest or license this product candidate in addition to the full Trigger Lock platform and has discontinued spending on this platform. 
Exenatide is a once-a-week Medusa-based injectable formulation of exenatide (FT228), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The Company received positive results from a Phase 1b clinical trial of FT228, a once-weekly subcutaneous injection formulation of exenatide using its proprietary Medusa™ technology. The study achieved all pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) objectives throughout four weekly administrations of Medusa™ exenatide (FT228), and assessed the safety, steady-state PK profile and the product’s potential effect on biomarkers and surrogate endpoints upon repeated administrations. One dose per week of FT228 at 140mcg was administered to twelve Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients over a four-week period. Following each administration, a continuous release of exenatide was observed over a period of up to 14 days and a relative bioavailability exceeding 94% was demonstrated. The PD performance of FT228 was comparable to current marketed products, Victoza® (liraglutide IR) and Bydureon® (exenatide SR). Avadel is currently seeking to divest or license this product candidate in addition to the full Medusa platform, and has discontinued spending on this platform. 
Additional Unapproved Marketed Drug Products
The Company intends to develop and seek NDA approval for select products that are currently marketed in the U.S. but are currently not approved by the FDA. The Company is actively developing a fourth unapproved sterile injectable product, for which it is working toward submission of an NDA by year end 2017. One of the Company’s principle criteria for the development of commercially viable products is a well-established record of efficacy. We believe this strategy may create opportunities to have the only approved version of products in niche markets, potentially enjoying a period of de facto exclusivity through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. However, this strategy has a limited number of opportunities where a meaningful return on investment is possible given the lack of patent protection from competition. The Company plans to evaluate several other unapproved products for potential development throughout the course of 2017, and will formally announce its intention to move forward with development should a candidate be selected.

Competition and Market Opportunities
Competition
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and is expected to increase. We compete with academic laboratories, research institutions, universities, joint ventures, and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including other companies developing niche brand or generic specialty pharmaceutical products or drug delivery platforms. Some of these competitors may also be our business partners. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would make it difficult or impossible for us to compete with their products. Furthermore, major technological changes can happen quickly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Such rapid technological change, or the development by our competitors of technologically improved or differentiated products, could render our drug delivery platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. 
The drug delivery industry landscape has dramatically changed over the past decade and even more so during the past six years, largely as a function of the growing importance of generic drugs. The growth of generics (typically small molecules) and of large molecules (biosimilars) has been accelerated by the demand for less expensive pharmaceutical products. As a result, the pricing power of pharmaceutical companies will be more tightly controlled in the future. 
In addition, the overall landscape of the Pharma/Biotech industry has changed, as consolidation has reduced our pool of potential partners and further accelerated the competition among drug delivery and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Over the past ten years, numerous stand-alone drug delivery companies have been acquired (partly or entirely) by pharmaceutical, biotech, generic or other drug delivery companies. By acquiring drug delivery platforms, those companies are internalizing their previously outsourced R&D efforts while potentially preventing competitors from accessing the acquired technologies. In the meantime, certain drug delivery companies have consolidated their existing positioning or have entered new markets via M&A transactions and/or restructuring. 
Just as Avadel has undertaken a strategy of developing and commercializing its own products, few of Avadel’s “historical” competitors still pursue a sole drug delivery business model as many others have moved or are moving to the Specialty Pharma model. A few examples include, but are not limited to, Alkermes, Depomed, Ethypharm and Octoplus N.V. (subsidiary of Dr. Reddy’s).

* From companies’ web site and/or press releases.
Avadel’s Specialty Pharma model (focusing on optimized re-formulations development capabilities) competes with a number of companies, based upon the product being developed. Examples of companies with whom we or future partners would compete, given our current pipeline, include Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Akorn Pharmaceuticals, Tris Pharma and others. Avadel as a specialty pharmaceutical company has various capabilities, including the use of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, the life cycle management of drugs, and direct commercialization of drugs.
Market Opportunities
Drug delivery platforms are of particular interest for managing the life cycle of pharmaceutical products, as they offer many advantages: 

• | improvements in bioavailability


• | pharmacokinetic improvements


• | enhanced efficacy


• | reduction of adverse events


• | improved patient compliance

Application of an improved and patented drug delivery technology to a drug provides differentiation and the potential to add product specific patent protection. Market exclusivity can also be granted for improvements to existing drugs. BCC Research estimated the global drug delivery market to worth an estimated $188 billion in 2014 and that the market grew to $194 billion in 2015. The increased number of geriatric patients and the demand for convenient drug delivery options offer major opportunities for the development of innovative and easy-to-use drug delivery platforms. In 2015, FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) approved 41 novel new drugs, as new molecular entities (“NMEs”) under New Drug Applications (NDAs) or as new therapeutic biologics under Biologics License Applications (“BLAs”) (FDA, Novel New Drugs 2014, Summary, January 2015). Additionally, the FDA approved 82 “first time generic drugs” (FDA, ANDA (Generic) Drug Approvals in 2015, www.fda.gov). 
Market opportunities for proprietary pipeline products that Avadel intends to pursue independently are estimated by the Company to be worth at least several hundred million dollars each. For example, Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) recorded $1.1 billion in sales for 2016 (source: Jazz press release Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results, February 28, 2017) and is expected to generate between $1.2 and $1.25 billion in revenues in 2017; and the U.S. cough, cold, pain and allergy markets targeted by our LiquiTime-based products, is estimated between $6 billion and $8 billion annually (source: Nielsen Data Trend). 
The industry faces many challenges. There are five main forces currently affecting all pharmaceutical and drug delivery companies and forcing the industry to adapt and to change: (i) the rise of generics; (ii) the rise in costs for new product development; (iii) the commoditization and acquisition of drug delivery technologies; (iv) the fact that integration of the drug delivery-based formulation development occurs at much earlier stage in the overall pharmaceutical development; and (v) higher regulatory and reimbursement hurdles. 
-10-

These forces have affected the small molecule space to a greater extent, as biologics currently enjoy higher barriers to entry. In particular, in today’s environment, a drug has to demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy advantage over the current standard of care in order to obtain third party payer coverage. Alternatively, changes in the delivery of a drug must create a demonstrable reduction in costs. Dosing convenience, by itself, is no longer sufficient to gain reimbursement acceptance. Drug delivery companies must now demonstrate, through costly Phase 3 trials, therapeutic efficacy of their new formulations. The FDA has actually encouraged drug companies developing enhanced formulations to use an abbreviated regulatory pathway: the 505(b)(2) NDA. Most drug delivery companies today are using this approach or the supplemental NDA pathway (“sNDA”). An NDA or sNDA is necessary to market an already approved drug for a new indication, or in a different dosage form or formulation. However, the sNDA approach requires cross-referencing the originator’s drug dossier, and eventually an alliance with the originator’s company for commercialization. 
Because the drug delivery industry is highly competitive, participants seek ways to lessen the pressure and increase profitability. Avadel, resulting from the combination of its existing proprietary drug delivery platforms with the established commercial capability of its unapproved to approved product strategy has evolved into a Specialty Pharma company focusing on re-formulations and requiring shorter product development cycles by using a “fast track” NDA mechanism (505(b)(2)). The company’s commercial capabilities also differentiate it from some competitors. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, with an impending “patent cliff”, are forcing Big Pharma/Biotech to reorganize and creating niche opportunities for Specialty Pharma companies like Avadel.
Avadel’s Drug Delivery Platforms 
Avadel owns and develops drug delivery platforms that address key formulation challenges, leading to the development of differentiated drug products for administration in various forms (e.g. capsules, tablets, sachets or liquid suspensions for oral use; or injectables for subcutaneous administration) and can be applied to a broad range of drugs (novel, already-marketed, or off-patent).
Micropump® is a microparticulate system that allows the development and marketing of modified and/or controlled release solid, oral dosage formulations of drugs. Micropump®-carvedilol and Micropump®-aspirin formulations have been approved in the U.S. 
LiquiTime® allows development of modified/controlled release oral products in a liquid suspension formulation particularly suited to children or for patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules.
Trigger Lock™ allows development of abuse-resistant modified/controlled release formulations of narcotic/opioid analgesics and other drugs susceptible to abuse.
We believe the versatility of Micropump which permits us to develop differentiated product profiles (modified/controlled release formulations) under various dosage forms including capsules, tablets, sachets and liquid suspensions (LiquiTime) for oral use, is a competitive advantage. With Trigger Lock potentially addressing the issue of narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse, we have broad and versatile presentations to serve most markets from pediatric to geriatric. 
Medusa™ allows the development of extended/modified release of injectable dosage formulations of drugs (e.g. peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and small molecules).
We believe that the Medusa platform provides a competitive advantage for developing differentiated injectable product profiles. Medusa-based formulations permit drugs’ full activity to be preserved in an extended release format with other potential advantages being, improved solubility, stability, and resistance to aggregation. Overall, Medusa™ can improve the patient experience through a change in the route of administration (e.g. switching from intravenous to subcutaneous injection) and may improve compliance through reduction of administration frequency (e.g. from once-a-day to once-a-week). 
The Company will continue to selectively partner its proprietary formulations capabilities and will either commercialize products based on its drug delivery platforms on its own or sell or partner them.
Micropump®: Delivery Platform for the Modified and/or Controlled Release of Solid, Oral Dosage Formulations of Drugs
Avadel’s Micropump platform permits either extended or delayed delivery of small molecule drugs via the oral route. Micropump consists of a multiple-particulate system containing 5,000 to 10,000 microparticles/nanoparticles per capsule or tablet. The 200-500 microns diameter-sized microparticles are released in the stomach and pass into the small intestine, where each microparticle, operating as a miniature delivery system, releases the drug at an adjustable rate and over an extended period of time. The design of the Micropump microparticles allows an extended release in the Gastro-Intestinal (“GI”) tract allowing mean plasma residence times to be extended for up to 24 hours. The microparticles’ design can be adapted to each drug’s specific characteristics by modifying the coating composition and thickness as well as the composition of the excipients encapsulated with the drug. The resultant formulations can potentially offer improved efficacy (by extending therapeutic coverage), reduced toxicity and/or side 
-11-

effects (by reducing Cmax or peak drug concentration in the plasma, or by reducing intra- and inter-patient variability), and improved patient compliance (by reducing frequency of administration). The platform is applicable to poorly soluble (< 0.01mg/L) as well as highly soluble (> 500g/L) and to low dose (e.g. 4 mg) or high dose (e.g. 1,000 mg) drugs, while providing excellent mouth feel and taste masking properties. Micropump allows the achievement of extremely precise pharmacokinetic profiles extended (and/or delayed) release of single or combination of drugs, in a variety of formats (such as tablets, capsules, sachet, or liquids (LiquiTime), while preserving the targeted release rate over the shelf-life of the product. 
Because R&D costs for reformulating a drug are typically substantially lower than for developing new chemical entities (NCEs), “reformulation approvals” provide an opportunity to extend the exclusivity period of already marketed drugs or create new market exclusivity for an off-patent drug. The Micropump platform has successfully transitioned to commercial stage with Coreg CR® (a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) marketed product). Avadel currently has additional Micropump-based products in development, including sodium oxybate for EDS and cataplexy, which has been successfully tested in two Phase I clinical studies (see “- Proprietary Product Pipeline” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and several early-stage feasibility studies of undisclosed drugs. 
Micropump (and related products) is patent protected (see “- Proprietary Intellectual Property”). Coreg CR® Micropump-based microparticles are now being manufactured for GSK by Recipharm AB (see “- Strategic Alliances” in this Part I, Item 1 and “- Manufacturing” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
LiquiTime®: Delivery Platform for the Modified/Controlled Release of Liquid, Oral Dosage Formulations of Drugs
U.S. sales of drugs, both prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC)) in liquid form for oral administration, exceeded $5.8 billion for the year 2016 (source: IMS). Amongst marketed “extended release” (twice-a-day or once-daily) liquid products areTussionex® (hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex) and its branded and generic alternatives, Delsym® and Delsym Children® (dextromethorphan polistirex developed and sold by Reckitt Benckiser plc.), Dyanavel XR (amphetamine, Tris) and Quillivant XR (methylphenidate) marketed by Pfizer. These products totaled almost $299 million sales in 2016 (source: IMS). Avadel has maintained the prescription rights to LiquiTime, as it views prescription products as higher-value opportunities. The Company is currently conducting feasibility studies on two potential prescription products utilizing its LiquiTime technology. 
Avadel’s LiquiTime platform uses Micropump’s competitive advantages to allow us to develop modified/controlled release (e.g. zero-order kinetics) in liquid suspension formulations. The LiquiTime products are particularly suitable for dosing to children and for use by patients having issues swallowing tablets or capsules. Unlike the other product examples described in the previous paragraph, which are all based on ion exchange resin technology, LiquiTime does not have the limitation of having to work solely with ionic drugs and therefore has applicability to a much broader range of drug molecules. As with Micropump, LiquiTime can be applied to the development of combination products. We believe that LiquiTime, designed to provide a controlled, extended release of oral liquids principally for pediatric and geriatric patients, will enable Avadel to develop improved, patent protected prescription products to serve an unmet medical need in these patient populations. We believe that the increasing number of geriatric patients and the demand for convenient drug delivery options for children offer opportunities for the development of LiquiTime-based formulations. 
Elan Pharmaceuticals has licensed the Liquitime technology in the US for OTC products and we are currently working on an extended release suspension formulation for guaifenesin (see “Proprietary Product Pipeline” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
LiquiTime (and related products) is patent protected (see “- Proprietary Intellectual Property” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
Trigger Lock™: Delivery Platform for Abuse-Resistant Modified/Controlled Release Formulations of Narcotic/Opioid Analgesics
 A major problem faced by society is the growing abuse and misuse of opioids by drug abusers, who attempt to extract the opioids from the drug products for the purposes of injection or to otherwise achieve the immediate release of the large doses contained in extended release products. The proportion of narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse associated with emergency room admissions has more than tripled in ten years, from 6.8% in 1998 to 26.5% in 2008 (TEDS report, July 15, 2010). Narcotic/opioid analgesics abuse continues to increase as current products remain easy to abuse. In 2010, enough prescription painkillers were prescribed to medicate every American adult every 4 hours for one month (PBS 2013). The number of prescription medicine abusers in 2010 was 8.76 million, 5.1 million of whom abused painkillers (drugabuse.com 2013). The market for opioid drugs, used to treat patients suffering from severe and chronic pain in the seven major markets (USA, Japan, and five European countries), was estimated to exceed $7.4 billion in 2010, dominated by oxycodone. In 2016, the U.S. sales of oral opioid drugs (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone and oxymorphone, including combination products) exceeded $5.9 billion (source: IMS).

Avadel’s Trigger Lock platform utilizes the Micropump technology and additional formulation techniques resulting in abuse-resistant modified/controlled release formulations of narcotics and other drugs susceptible to abuse. 
Trigger Lock has the potential to provide products that are either bioequivalent to or have improved pharmacokinetics over marketed narcotic/opioid analgesics. We believe that the FDA’s moves to restrict the prescribing of extended-release opioid analgesics should benefit abuse-resistant formulations, such as Trigger Lock. The FDA issued a “Draft Guidance for Abuse Deterrent Opioids” on January 9, 2013.
We believe that Trigger Lock could potentially satisfy the FDA Draft Guidance for Abuse Deterrent Opioids for the following reasons:

• | Laboratory-based in vitro manipulation and extraction studies (Category 1) - Success with Trigger Lock


• | Pharmacokinetic studies (Category 2) - Success with Trigger Lock


• | Clinical abuse potential studies (Category 3) - To be required prior to marketing


• | Analysis of post marketing data to assess the impact of an abuse-resistant formulation on actual abuse in a community setting (Category 4) - To be performed post marketing

Avadel has one Trigger Lock-based internal product, hydromorphone, developed for which certain PK and independent in-vitro abuse resistance data was gathered in 2015. The Company will consider the sale or out-license of its Trigger-Lock platform to a third party. (see “- Proprietary Product Pipeline” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Trigger Lock (and related products) is patent protected (see “- Proprietary Intellectual Property” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Medusa™ Delivery Platform for the Modified/Controlled Release of Injectable Dosage Formulations of Drugs
U.S. sales for injectable products in 2016 exceeded $150 billion, including more than $18 billion for “long-acting” products (source: IMS). Global sales of biologics were between $190 to $222 billion in 2014 according to various analysts, and are expected to exceed $386 billion by 2019 (source: BCC Research).
Avadel’s Medusa, a proprietary hydrogel depot platform, enables less frequent injections by extending the release profile of subcutaneously delivered drugs. Importantly, Medusa is able to do this without modifying the drug substance thereby offering a potentially faster and less risky regulatory pathway to approval. 
The Medusa platform consists of proprietary and versatile drug carrier polymers that form hydrogel depots after injection. Medusa polymers are made of glutamic acid, a naturally occurring amino acid, and alpha tocopherol (Vitamin E). These polymers are amphiphilic and spontaneously form stable hydrogels in water. These hydrogels contain hydrophobic nanodomains rich in Vitamin E and hydrophilic polyglutamate that are exposed to water. The hydrogels are robust over a wide range of pH values and can be stored, in particular as a stable freeze-dry form, that can be easily reconstituted in water for injection. Those polymers have been proven to be safe and biodegradable. A comprehensive absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and regulatory toxicology package for the key Medusa polymer was completed in 2014 in order to update the Type IV Drug Master File (“DMF”) filed with the FDA in February 2011.
The drug is loaded in the hydrogel (nano- or micro-gel) via non-covalent, hydrophobic and electrostatic bonds. Once in the body, the hydrogel releases the drug in a controlled manner with no initial burst effect, a lower Cmax, and uniform plasma concentration over an extended period of time. Both drug loading (in fully aqueous solution, and usually, under solvent- and surfactant-free conditions) and release (essentially by displacement of the loaded drug by circulating endogenous proteins) are non-denaturing, which preserves structural integrity - and hence activity of the drug. The transient, non-covalent interactions dictate the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and bioavailability in particular) of the released drugs.
We believe that Medusa is best suited for “biobetter” development opportunities, which can be summarized as follows:

• | Proven biologic drugs with established markets and proven clinical development approaches;


• | Product differentiation e.g. improvement of pharmacokinetic (and potentially pharmacodynamics) parameters;


• | Protection of market position through product differentiation and/or patent extension; and,


• | Ability to grow market share and resist price competition.

Avadel had one Medusa-based internal product in development (see “- Proprietary Product Pipeline” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Avadel completed a Phase 1(a) study of its once-a-week Medusa exenatide product in 2015 and a Phase 1(b) study in second quarter of 2016. The Company is currently looking to divest this platform in order to more narrowly focus on its most developed technology platforms, Micropump and LiquiTime.

Medusa is patent protected until June 2031 in the United States (see “- Proprietary Intellectual Property” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

Manufacturing
The manufacturing facilities for our drug delivery platforms are located in Pessac, France, near Bordeaux (hereinafter referred as the “Pessac Facility”). The Pessac Facility, which was previously owned by Flamel Technologies SA, provided us with two commercial scale production lines for the manufacture of Coreg CR ® microparticles, and another production line used for other Micropump, and LiquiTime/Trigger Lock-based formulations (i.e. the production of certain pharmaceutical products, including commercial scale quantities of our intermediate formulated products). During 2014, our commercial manufacturing capacity utilization ranged from 50% to 65% of total capacity. 
On December 1, 2014, the Pessac Facility was divested to Recipharm. This divestiture agreement allows Avadel to retain access to the development and manufacturing capabilities of Pessac Facility for all its drug delivery platforms. In particular, this facility can support, like any CDMO, certain of our needs for scale-up activities and clinical batch manufacturing for our Micropump, LiquiTime and Trigger Lock platforms, as well as for the synthesis of Medusa’s polymers and technical batch manufacturing for non-clinical studies pertaining to our Medusa-based formulations. In addition, this agreement permits us to utilize other Recipharm manufacturing facilities for the development and/or manufacture of our proprietary pipeline if needed. 
The Pessac Facility was never used for the production of finished products commercialized by our US operations. The manufacture of the UMDs marketed by the Company’s US operations is outsourced to cGMP compliant and FDA-audited CDMOs in accordance with supply agreements. 
Avadel intends to continue to outsource to third party contract manufacturing companies like Recipharm when appropriate. For example, in 2014, Avadel transferred the scale up of certain of its own proprietary products to CDMOs in the U.S. This will be beneficial to the Company for products that will ultimately be marketed in the United States.
Government Regulation
The design, testing, manufacturing and marketing of certain new or substantially modified drugs, biological products or medical devices must be approved, cleared or certified by regulatory agencies, regulatory authorities and Notified Bodies under applicable laws and regulations, the requirements of which may vary from country to country. This regulatory process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under various federal statutes, including the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act. Similar requirements exist in the Member States of the European Union and are imposed by the European Commission and the competent authorities of EU Member States. There can be no assurance that we or our collaborative partners will be able to obtain such regulatory approvals or clearances or certification of conformity on a timely basis, if at all, for any products under development. Delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals, clearances, or certifications of conformity, the revocation of previously received approvals or clearances, or certifications of conformity, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any finished product that we develop, either inclusive or not of our drug delivery platforms, is subject to regulatory approval in the respective country where we intend to market the product. In the United States and the European Union, biological products, such as therapeutic proteins and peptides, generally are subject to the same FDA and EU regulatory requirements as other drugs, although some differences exist. For example, a biologic license application (BLA) is submitted for approval for commercialization of some biological products instead of the New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) used for other drugs. Also, unlike other drug products, some biological products are subject to FDA lot-by-lot release requirements and those approved under a BLA currently cannot be the subject of ANDAs. However, the FDA is working on a variety of issues pertaining to the possible development of biosimilars and there can be no assurance that this type of submission will continue to be unavailable for biological products. Additionally, our delivery platforms likely will be regulated by the FDA as ‘combination products’ if they are used together with a biologic or medical device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of both components. In the European Union, applications for marketing authorization of innovative drugs, which are essentially products that are neither generics nor biosimilars, are addressed on a case-by-case basis by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), followed by a decision of the European Commission, or by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.

New Drug and Biological Product Development and Approval Process 
United States and European Union
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries has a significant impact on the development, manufacture, and marketing of biological and drug products and on ongoing research and product development activities. The products of all of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners as well as our own products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies and regulatory authorities prior to commercialization. In particular, these products are subject to manufacturing according to stringent cGMP quality principles, and rigorous, pre-clinical and clinical testing and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA, the European Commission and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States and the European Union, various statutes and regulations also govern, or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. 
The FDA and European Union’s statutes, regulations, or policies may change and additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approvals of biological or drug products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 
Regulatory approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope. In particular, regulatory approvals will restrict the marketing of a product to specific uses. Approved biological and other drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review (including requirements and restrictions related to record keeping and reporting, FDA, European Commission and EU Member States competent authorities’ approval of certain changes in manufacturing processes or product labeling, product promotion and advertising, and pharmacovigilance, which includes monitoring and reporting adverse reactions, maintaining safety measures, and conducting dossier reviews for marketing authorization renewal). Discovery of previously unknown problems with these products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or injunction, as well as other actions affecting the commercial prospects of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners’ potential products or uses or products that incorporate our technologies. Any failure by our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to comply with current or new and changing regulatory obligations, and any failure to obtain and maintain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals, could materially adversely affect our business. 
The process for new drug and biological product development and approval has many steps, including:
Chemical and Formulation Development
Pharmaceutical formulation taking into account the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biological substance is the beginning of a new product. If initial laboratory experiments reveal that the concept for a new drug or biological product looks promising, then a variety of further development steps and tests complying with internationally recognized guidance documents will have to be continued, in order to provide for a product ready for testing in animals and, after sufficient animal test results, also in humans. 
Concurrent with pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, companies must continue to develop information about the properties of the drug product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product, and the manufacturer must develop and validate methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
Pre-Clinical Testing
Once a biological or drug candidate is identified for development, the candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. This includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies of pharmacology (mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics) and toxicology which may have to be conducted over lengthy periods of time, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product as formulated. Pre-clinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations, the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations in the US and the Clinical Trials Directive and related national laws and guidelines in the EU Member States. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, then requiring such studies to be replicated. In some cases, long-term pre-clinical studies are conducted while clinical studies are ongoing.
-16-

 Investigational New Drug Application 
USA: The entire body of chemical or biochemical, pharmaceutical and pre-clinical development work necessary to administer investigational drugs to human volunteers or patients is summarized in an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA. The IND becomes effective if not rejected by the FDA within thirty (30) days after filing. There is no assurance that the submission of an IND will eventually allow a company to commence clinical trials. All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with good clinical practice regulations to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trial results and data. These regulations include the requirement that, with limited exceptions, all subjects provide informed consent. In addition, an institutional review board (“IRB”), composed primarily of physicians and other qualified experts at the hospital or clinic where the proposed studies will be conducted, must review and approve each human study. The IRB also continues to monitor the study and must be kept aware of the study’s progress, particularly as to adverse events and changes in the research. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events occur. Failure to adhere to good clinical practices and the protocols, and failure to obtain IRB approval and informed consent, may result in FDA rejection of clinical trial results and data, and may delay or prevent the FDA from approving the drug for commercial use.
European Union: The European equivalent to the IND is the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (“IMPD”) which likewise must contain pharmaceutical, pre-clinical and, if existing, previous clinical information on the drug substance and product. An overall risk-benefit assessment critically analyzing the non-clinical and clinical data in relation to the potential risks and benefits of the proposed trial must also be included. The intended clinical trial must be submitted for authorization by the regulatory authority(ies) of each EU Member States in which the trial is intended to be conducted prior to its commencement. The trial must be conducted on the basis of the protocol as approved by an Ethics Committee(s) in each EU Member State (EU equivalent to IRBs) before the trial commences. Before submitting an application to the competent authority, the sponsor must register the trial in the EudraCT database where it will be provided with a unique EudraCT number.
Clinical Trials
Typically, clinical testing involves the administration of the drug or biological product first to healthy human volunteers and then to patients with conditions needing treatment under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator, usually a physician, pursuant to a ‘protocol’ or clinical plan reviewed by the FDA and the competent authorities of the EU Member States along with the IRB or Ethics Committee (via the IND or IMPD submission). The protocol details matters such as a description of the condition to be treated, the objectives of the study, a description of the patient population eligible for the study and the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy. 
Clinical trials are time-consuming and costly, and typically are conducted in three sequential phases, which sometimes may overlap. Phase I trials consist of testing the product in a small number of patients or normal volunteers, primarily for safety, in one or more dosages, as well as characterization of a drug’s pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile. In Phase II, in addition to safety, the product is studied in a patient population to evaluate the product’s efficacy for the specific, targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase III trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed sites. With limited exceptions, all patients involved in a clinical trial must provide informed consent prior to their participation. Meeting clinical endpoints in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Phase I, II, and III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. 
The FDA and the competent authorities of EU Member States monitor the progress of each clinical trial phase conducted under an IND or IMPD and may, at their discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any point in this process for various reasons, including a finding that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or a determination that it is unethical to continue the study. The FDA, the European Commission and the competent authorities of EU Member States can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. The IRB, the Ethics Committee, and sponsor also may order the temporary or permanent discontinuance of a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, particularly if safety concerns arise. Such holds can cause substantial delay and in some cases, may require abandonment of product development. These clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations, the Clinical Trials Directive and/or internationally recognized guidance such as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ("ICH").
New Drug Application or Biological License Application
After the completion of the clinical trial phases of development, if the sponsor concludes that there is substantial evidence that the drug or biological candidate is effective and that the drug is safe for its intended use, an NDA or “BLA” (“Biological License Application”) may be submitted to the FDA. The application must contain all of the information on the drug or biological candidate gathered to that date, including data from the pre-clinical and clinical trials, information pertaining to the preparation of the drug

or biologic, analytical methods, product formulation, details on the manufacture of finished products, proposed product packaging, labeling and stability (shelf-life). NDAs and BLAs are often over 100,000 pages in length. If FDA determines that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include as part of the application a proposed REMS, including a package insert directed to patients, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, restrictions on a drug’s distribution, or a medication guide to provide better information to consumers about the drug’s risks and benefits. Submission of an NDA or BLA does not assure FDA approval for marketing.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing (the U.S. prerequisite for dossier review). It may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation. There is a strong presumption for advisory committee review for any drug containing an active ingredient not previously approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a fee. In return, the FDA assigns an action date of 10 months from acceptance of the application to return of a first ‘complete response,’ in which the FDA may approve the product or request additional information. (Although PDUFA also provides for a six-month “priority review” process, we do not anticipate it applying to any of our products or our partners’ products.) There can be no assurance that an application will be approved within the performance goal timeframe established under PDUFA, if at all. If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA is not favorable, the FDA usually will outline the deficiencies in the submission and request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, or even in lieu of asking for additional information, the FDA may decide that the marketing application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and issue a complete response letter, communicating the agency’s decision not to approve the application. 
FDA approval of an NDA or BLA will be based, among other factors, on the agency’s review of the pre-clinical and clinical data submitted, a risk/benefit analysis of the product, and an evaluation of the manufacturing processes and facilities. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant’s interpretation of the data submitted in its NDA or BLA. For instance, FDA may require us to provide data from additional preclinical studies or clinical trials to support approval of certain development products acquired from Éclat. Among the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that each prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP standards and requirements. Manufacturing establishments often are subject to inspections prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with cGMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the relevant marketing application.
Patent Restoration and Exclusivity
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products.
Generic Drugs. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the “Reference Listed Drug,” or “RLD”. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
505(b)(2) NDAs. If a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Act. Unlike an ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on published scientific literature and the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. With regard to certain UMD products, we intend to submit 505(b)(2) NDAs, relying solely on published scientific literature. We do not plan to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for these 505(b)(2) NDAs; and, if we were required to do so, would review the continued value of the product.
RLD Patents. An NDA sponsor must advise the FDA about patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several 
-18-

certifications regarding each listed patent. A “Paragraph III” certification is the sponsor’s statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A “Paragraph IV” certification is a challenge to the patent; it is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product. 
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application with patent challenge has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
Regulatory Exclusivities. The Hatch-Waxman Act may provide periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs. If a product is a “new chemical entity,” or NCE, - generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug - there may be a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor makes a Paragraph IV certification challenging a listed patent. Because it takes time for the FDA to review and approve an application once it has been accepted for filing, five-year NCE exclusivity usually effectively means the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is not approved for a period well beyond five years from approval of the RLD. 
A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity, if the NDA contains clinical data that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. For example, if an NDA is submitted for a product that is not an NCE, but that seeks approval for a new indication, and clinical data were required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product for that use, the FDA could not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for another product with that active moiety for that use. For example, Coreg CR received three-year exclusivity for the clinical trials that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the new, controlled-release dosage form; that exclusivity, which has expired, blocked other controlled-release products. 
Patent Term Restoration. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA or 505(b)(2) application is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration. When any of our products is approved, we intend to seek patent term restoration for an applicable patent when it is appropriate.
Other Countries
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a pharmaceutical product by regulatory authorities must be obtained in any other country prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. The approval procedure may vary from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Under European Union legislation, product authorization is granted for an initial period of five years. The authorization may subsequently be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the competent authorizing authority. In the EU, marketing authorization of drugs is according to either a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, generally depending on the nature and type of drug. Certain designated drugs may be authorized only in accordance with the centralized procedure by the European Commission following an opinion by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The centralized procedure is mandatory for pharmaceutical products developed by means of biotechnological processes (recombinant DNA, controlled expression of genes coding, hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods), products containing new actives substances indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, diabetes and neuro-degenerative diseases, orphan designated medicinal products and advanced therapy products. Other pharmaceutical products may be authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure where it is demonstrated that they contain new active substances or are demonstrated to have a significant therapeutic benefit, or where they constitute a scientific or technical innovation, or are in the interest of patients at Community level. Where authorization is in accordance with the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, approval is either by “mutual 
-19-

recognition,” whereby the authorization granted by the competent authorities of one EU Member States are recognized by the authorities of other EU Member States, or where the competent authorities of each EU Member State authorize a product on the basis of an identical dossier, with one national authority taking care of the dossier intensively and coordinating activities. To the extent possible, clinical trials of our products are designed to develop a regulatory package sufficient for the grant of marketing authorization in the EU approval according to the Community Code on medicinal products. 
Regulatory approval of prices for certain drugs is required in many other countries outside the United States. In particular, many EU Member States make the reimbursement of a product within the national social security system conditional on the agreement by the seller not to sell the product above a fixed price in that country. Also common is the unilateral establishment of a reimbursement price by the national authorities, often accompanied by the inclusion of the product on a list of reimbursable products. Related pricing discussions and ultimate governmental approvals can take several months to years. Some countries require periodic pricing updates and renewals at intervals ranging from two to five years. Some countries also impose price freezes or obligatory price reductions. We cannot assure you that, if regulatory authorities establish lower prices for any product incorporating our technology in any one EU Member State, this will not have the practical effect of requiring our collaborative partner correspondingly to reduce its prices in other EU Member States. We can offer no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return on our investment in our products.  
Regulation of Combination Drugs
Medical products containing a combination of drugs or biological products may be regulated as ‘combination products’ in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprising components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g. drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a drug, biologic or device. 
To determine which FDA center or centers will review a combination product submission, companies may submit a request for assignment to the FDA. Those requests may be handled formally or informally. In some cases, jurisdiction may be determined informally based on FDA experience with similar products. However, informal jurisdictional determinations are not binding on the FDA. Companies also may submit a formal Request for Designation to the FDA Office of Combination Products. The Office of Combination Products will review the request and make its jurisdictional determination within 60 days of receiving a Request for Designation. 
In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of both components. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. It is possible that our delivery platforms, when coupled with a drug, biologic or medical device component, could be considered and regulated by the FDA as a combination product. 
If the primary mode of action is determined to be a drug, the product will be reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) either in consultation with another center or independently. If the primary mode of action is determined to be a medical device, the product would be reviewed by Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) either in consultation with another center, such as CDER, or independently. In addition, FDA could determine that the product is a biologic and subject to the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (“CBER”), although it is also possible that a biological product will be regulated by CDER. 
In the European Union, drug combinations, that is, drug products containing two or more drug substances each of which has to contribute a proven advantage of therapy (e.g. synergism, less adverse reactions), are subject to drug regulations like all others. Products combining drug substances or drugs with a device may be subject to device and/or drug regulations, or may be classified as medical devices, depending on the individual case.
Marketing Approval and Reporting Requirements
If the FDA approves an NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for physicians to prescribe. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase IV studies, as a condition of approval to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product. These studies may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product’s effects in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. After approval, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, as well as periodic status reports, if new safety information develops. These post-marketing studies may include clinical trials to investigate known serious risks or signals of serious risks or identify unexpected serious risks. Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil fines and can result in withdrawal of approval. Avadel has several Phase IV obligations with its current approvals. 
-20-

In addition, the FDA may require distribution to patients of a medication guide such as a REMS for prescription products that the agency determines pose a serious and significant health concern in order to provide information necessary to patients’ safe and effective use of such products. 
In the European Union, the marketing authorization of a medicinal product may be made conditional on the conduct of Phase IV post-marketing studies. Failure to conduct these studies in relation to centrally authorized products can lead to the imposition of substantial fines. Moreover, Phase IV studies are often conducted by companies in order to obtain further information on product efficacy and positioning on the market in view of competitors and to assist in application for pricing and reimbursement.
Other Post-Marketing Obligations
Any products manufactured and/or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, submitting other periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. For example, with respect to Vazculep, the FDA has required the Company to conduct post-marketing clinical and non-clinical studies to be completed between 2016 and 2019. 
Drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state or local agencies. In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in recordkeeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other post-marketing requirements. Failure of the Company or our licensees to comply with FDA’s cGMP regulations or other requirements could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional pre-clinical or clinical studies, or even in some instances, revocation or withdrawal of the approval. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA’s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product, withdrawal or recall of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the manufacturer and NDA or BLA holder. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA or BLA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or affect the conditions under which approved products are marketed. 
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 provides the FDA with expanded authority over drug products after approval. This legislation enhances the FDA’s authority with respect to post-marketing safety surveillance, including, among other things, the authority to require additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials, labeling changes as a result of safety findings, registering clinical trials, and making clinical trial results publicly available. 
In the European Union, stringent pharmacovigilance regulations oblige companies to appoint a suitably qualified and experienced Qualified Person resident in the European Economic Area, to prepare and submit to the competent authorities adverse event reports within specific time lines, prepare Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and provide other supplementary information, report to authorities at regular intervals and take adequate safety measures agreed with regulatory agencies as necessary. Failure to undertake these obligations can lead to the imposition of substantial fines.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
The Hatch-Waxman construct applies only to conventional chemical drug compounds, sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds approved under an NDA. On March 23, 2010, however, the “Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act” of 2009, or “BPCIA”, was signed into law. It creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are “biosimilar” to a previously approved biological product, which is called the “reference product.” This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar product to come to market more quickly and less expensively than if a “full” BLA were submitted, by relying to some extent on FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference product to which the proposed product is similar. If a proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standards for approval (which include demonstrating that it is highly similar to the reference product and there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency between the products), the proposed biosimilar may be approved on the basis of an application that is different than the standard BLA. In addition, a biosimilar 
-21-

product may be approved as interchangeable with the reference product if the proposed product application meets standards intended to ensure that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product.
Other Regulation
Controlled Substances Act. Our Trigger Lock delivery platform is designed to control the release of narcotics and other active ingredients subject to abuse. Narcotics are “controlled substances” under the Controlled Substances Act. The federal “Controlled Substances Act” (“CSA”), Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, regulates the manufacture and distribution of narcotics and other controlled substances, including stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens. The CSA is administered by the “Drug Enforcement Administration” (“DEA”), a division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and is intended to prevent the abuse or diversion of controlled substances into illicit channels of commerce. The company has several products marketed under this Act and has at least one product under development. 
Any person or firm that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance (or proposes to do so) must register with the DEA. The applicant must register for a specific business activity related to controlled substances, including manufacturing or distributing, and may engage in only the activity or activities for which it is registered. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances and allots quotas of controlled drugs to manufacturers and marketers’ failure to comply with relevant DEA regulations, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in regulatory action including civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations, or proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations can lead to criminal prosecution. In addition to these federal statutory and regulatory obligations, there may be state and local laws and regulations relevant to the handling of controlled substances or listed chemicals.
cGMP. Current Good Manufacturing Practices rules apply to the manufacturing of drugs and medical devices. Our manufacturing facilities and laboratories are subject to inspection and regulation by French regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable EU provisions governing cGMP and may also be subject to the United States’ and other countries’ regulatory agencies. Mutual recognition agreements for government inspections exist between the United States, the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to French, U.S. and other countries’ rules and regulations governing permissible laboratory activities, waste disposal, handling of toxic, dangerous or radioactive materials and other matters. Our R&D involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by French, EU, U.S. and other foreign rules and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” such as anti-kickback and false claims laws. Under anti-kickback laws, it is illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance via regulations and that there are few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our sales and marketing activities relating to our products could be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. In addition, similar sanctions and penalties can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers. As a result of the potential penalties that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. In addition to the reasons noted above, our activities could be subject to challenge due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. There also are an increasing number of federal and state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing, marketing information, and payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent authorities.
-22-

Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws. We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorney generals are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. In the EU/EEA, Directive 95/46/EEC (as amended) or its successor applies to identified or identifiable personal data processed by automated means (e.g. a computer database of customers) and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA. 
“Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws. There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, and make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, a similar recently implemented federal requirement requires manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The federal government began disclosing the reported information on a publicly available website in 2014. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our medicines in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 
Government Price Reporting. For those marketed medicines which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require medicines be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such medicines to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increases have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny.
Healthcare Reimbursement
In both U.S. and foreign markets, sales of our potential products as well as products of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that incorporate our technology into their products, if any, will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The U.S. market for pharmaceutical products is increasingly being shaped by managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, cooperative buying organizations and large drugstore chains. Third-party payers are challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Uncertainty particularly exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. There can be no assurance reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our product development investment. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our proposed products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement for medical products and services.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 192 employees, of which approximately 165 were full-time.  None of the Company's employees are subject to a union or other collective bargaining agreement.  Employees at our French subsidiaries 
-23-

(approximately 101 employees) are represented by a works' council in which employee representatives have the right to be consulted as to certain matters affecting the French entities.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.
