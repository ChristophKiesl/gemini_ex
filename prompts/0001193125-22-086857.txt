Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on February 2, 2021 and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 
 On February 10, 2021, our sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 6,250,000 shares of Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”). The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 937,500 shares subject to forfeiture by our sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that our sponsor would collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the initial public offering. On September 11, 2021, the remaining over-allotment option expired. As a result, 937,500 shares of Class B common stock were forfeited. 
 The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on August 2, 2021. On August 5, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering of 25,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering on August 5, 2021, we consummated the sale of 7,700,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to our sponsor, Healthwell Acquisition Corp. I Sponsor LLC, generating gross proceeds of $7,700,000. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in a trust account. If we do not complete a business combination by August 5, 2023 (within 24 months from the consummation of the initial public offering), the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). 
 The outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with a business combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all Common Stock issued and outstanding upon the completion of the Offering plus all Class A Common Stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, excluding the forward purchase agreements and any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock issued in a financing transaction in connection with the initial Business Combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.

  Our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants are each traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “HWELU,” “HWEL” and “HWELW,” respectively. Our units commenced public trading on August 3, 2021, and our shares of Class A common stock and warrants commenced separate public trading on September 22, 2021. 
 Business Strategy & Competitive Strengths 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that leverages and complements the experience of our team. Through our management, Board and advisors’ broad and deep networks, unique industry experiences, and deal sourcing capabilities, we have access to a vast set of opportunities. 
Target Industry 
 Although we may pursue targets in any business industry or sector, we intend to focus our investment efforts on technology-enabled companies across the entire healthcare industry. Investment opportunities will be sourced through our longstanding investment banking, venture capital and private equity relationships, as well as an extensive network of serial entrepreneurs and operators in healthcare and technology built over decades. The Company benefits from decades of transaction experience with companies at all stages of their life cycles. The Company will use a disciplined and highly selective investment process that leverages the depth and diversity of management, the Board and a team of advisors to enhance the growth potential and value of a target business, while focusing on providing the potential of an attractive return to our stockholders. 
 The U.S. healthcare industry nears $3.8 trillion in value, representing an expansive market with powerful secular tailwinds and a broad universe of business combination targets. By 2028, expenditures are expected to reach $6.2 trillion, highlighting an average growth rate of approximately 5.4% per year, driven in large part by a rapidly aging population and increased prevalence of chronic disease. Given the accelerating spending growth, fragmented market, and staggering imbalances in access, quality, and cost in healthcare across America, technological innovation and tech-enablement are at the forefront of accelerating access to care and in terms of value creation in the sector. 
 Though we intend to focus our investment effort broadly across tech-enabled healthcare, we will leverage our team’s expertise to target businesses in technology-driven products, platforms and services in and for healthcare, tech-enabled healthcare services, and tech-enabled wellness platforms, products and services. These subsectors benefit from favorable market dynamics, are underrepresented in the public markets and align well with the backgrounds and experience of our management team and Board. The diversity of the target universe and the number of largely uncorrelated subsectors maximize the likelihood that the management team, Board and advisors will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction. We intend to concentrate on targets with an enterprise value range between $750 million and $1 billion. 
 Industry Opportunity 
 While we may acquire a business in any industry, the $3.8 trillion healthcare market has numerous scaled companies that would benefit from a public listing, providing us with a broad set of attractive targets. With several dynamics, including an aging population and increased pervasiveness of chronic disease driving accelerated spending growth, technology-driven innovation is pivotal to improving the state of the country’s healthcare system. While our investment effort will be broadly focused on tech-enabled healthcare, we have identified several attractive subsectors where we have particular expertise:

• | Healthcare Technology. As North America leads the global healthcare technology market, there are numerous platforms that are viable targets. With emerging technologies such as next-generation diagnostics and AI-powered platforms, products and devices, technology provides a significant opportunity to improve care outcomes while driving down the cost of care. Moreover, the proliferation of healthcare data, which is increasingly available in real-time, has the potential to enable providers to move quicker and act more precisely, in turn driving improved outcomes and efficiency at decreased costs. We believe that leading technology companies will continue to transform the healthcare system.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tech-Enabled Healthcare Services. Technology-oriented business models are transforming healthcare and creating significant value for all market participants, including payors, providers, employers, and consumers. While the increasing complexity of the healthcare system poses challenges to traditional market participants, companies that adopt a tech-enabled model are typically better positioned to succeed and capture market share. Just as technology platforms have solved major challenges and improved productivity in other industries, similar opportunities exist within healthcare, with ~25% of total U.S. healthcare spending deemed as wasteful. As an example, telehealth has decreased unmet health needs while also reducing system-wide cost and allowing providers to deliver care with increased access and/or increased productivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tech-Enabled Wellness. The U.S. is the world’s largest health and wellness market. Even through COVID-19 disrupted some traditional wellness business models, rising consumer focus on physical and mental wellness has in many cases, such as with emotional wellness, accelerated over the past two years. Tech-enabled innovation has been broad, from virtual fitness offerings to scientifically-driven nutritional products and intuitive integration of mental health to traditional healthcare services. Rising provider and government prioritization of social determinants of health, as well as increasing payor focus on preventative care to decrease acute care costs, is expected to drive robust growth in the wellness market going forward.

Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our strategy, we have identified general criteria and guidelines which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will leverage these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 We will look for a company with the following investment criteria: 
 

• | Has a differentiated product or service offering with a sustainable competitive advantage;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a clear value proposition within healthcare to either increase access to care, care quality, care efficiency and/or decrease costs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a track record of above industry average revenue growth with strong customer satisfaction;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a strong management team with a track record of value creation that can leverage our management team, Board and advisors and can collaborate with us to unlock the company’s full potential value;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enjoys a robust financial profile with sustainable gross margins and has the potential to generate consistent, steady and recurring free cash flow;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

  
• | Has an ability to generate attractive returns on capital;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Sits within a growing industry subsector with strong secular tailwinds and competitive viability and is resilient to economic cycles;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has an actionable organic and M&A growth runway and that can utilize M&A to grow and bolster the financial profile of the acquired business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Has a scalable platform and infrastructure to reap the benefits of public listing, including access to capital for growth opportunities and the ability to attract additional key employees; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can leverage the network, proprietary growth and value creation opportunities and expertise of our team to accelerate the company’s growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 Our directors and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, or in the case of a non-compete restriction, may not present such opportunity to us at all, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under the laws of the State of Delaware. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers will materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or complete our initial business combination. Our directors and officers are also not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 
 Past experience or performance of our management team, Directors, advisors or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (2) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team, Directors, advisors or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance.

  Initial Business Combination 
 The Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test. 
 Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets 
 We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
 In addition, members of our management team have developed contacts from serving on the boards of directors of several companies. We believe this network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. 
 
7 

  We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to limitations. At the completion of our initial business combination, we will be required to purchase any common stock properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders, directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.

  Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our sponsor, directors and officers have agreed that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering by August 5, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by August 5, 2023. 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65% of our common stock. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficially own 20% of our common stock upon the inception of this company (assuming they do not purchase any units in the initial public offering), may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

• | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on our initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the inception of this company or (y) amend the foregoing provisions;

• | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our executive officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;

• | If a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. Whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the Nasdaq, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above;

• | So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, the Nasdaq rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;

A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. 
 Competition 
 We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our shares of Class A common stock, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. 
Indemnity 
 Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. 
 
11 

  Facilities 
 We currently maintain our executive office address at 1001 Green Bay Rd. #227, Winnetka, IL 60093. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
 Employees 
 We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Corporate Information 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter.
