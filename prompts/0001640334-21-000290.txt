General
 
Our Company
 
Toga Limited (“Toga,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a Nevada holding company with its corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, California that conducts its business through its subsidiaries, all of which operate exclusively in Asia. We have two lines of business. The first is our technology business, in which we are developing a social media app called “Yippi” or the “Yippi App.” The Yippi App is a mobile application with a focus on enabling people to connect and share with friends and family on the app. Our second business consists of products based on traditional, eastern wellness principles that we market and sell under our “Eostre” brand through a direct marketing network. 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on October 23, 2003 pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Fashionfreakz International Inc., which we later changed to Blink Couture, Inc. From 2003 until 2008, our principal business was the online retail marketing of trendy clothing and accessories produced by independent designers, with headquarters based in Canada. From 2008 until 2017, the Company’s business plan consisted of exploring potential targets for a business combination. On July 22, 2016, we changed our name to “Toga Limited.” In July 2018, we changed our state of incorporation to the State of Nevada.

We have had two stock splits. On September 11, 2017, we effected a forward-split of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at the rate of fifty shares for every one share (1:50). On June 5, 2019, we effected a reverse-split of all of the outstanding shares of the common stock at the rate of one share for every ten shares (10:1). For ease of reference, all share amounts and prices contained herein reflect the effect of the reverse stock split. On September 11, 2020, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “A&R Articles of Incorporation”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada for the purpose of dividing and designating the 1,000,000,000 shares of the common stock into two classes, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of Class A voting common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (referred to herein as our “Common Stock”), and 500,000,000 shares of Class B non-voting common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (our “Class B Common Stock”), none of which are currently issued and outstanding.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 515 South Flower Street, 18th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90071. Our telephone number is (949) 333-1603. Our internet address is https://togalimited.com/.

Subsidiaries
 
In September 2017, we formed TOGL Technology Sdn. Bhd. (“TOGL Technology”), a wholly-owned subsidiary located in Malaysia. In May 2018, TOGL Technology opened a branch office in Taiwan. The Company suspended operations of its Taiwan branch in July 2020 due to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”). TOGL Technology offers technology and professional services to facilitate the use of technology by enterprises and end users. These services include software development, integration, maintenance, mobile services, and web applications. TOGL Technology also provides development of, and upgrades to, our mobile application, the Yippi App.
 
In November 2017, we formed PT Toga International Indonesia (“PT Toga Indonesia”), a majority-owned subsidiary located in Indonesia. We own a 95% interest in PT Toga Indonesia. The remaining portion is owned by three individuals who are employed by our subsidiaries. PT Toga Indonesia mainly sells health-related and facial products via retail stores or through direct selling independent sales agents that sell our “Eostre” branded products at exhibitions and healthy introduction seminars.
 
In January 2019, TOGL Technology, formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Toga Vietnam Company Limited (“Toga Vietnam”), located in Vietnam. Toga Vietnam provides customer services support for Yippi users located in Vietnam.
 
In May 2019, TOGL Technology, formed a majority-owned subsidiary, PT TOGL Technology Indonesia (“PT TOGL Indonesia”), located in Indonesia. TOGL Technology owns a 67% interest in PT TOGL Indonesia.

Subsidiaries formed after July 31, 2019
 
In June 2020, Michael Toh Kok Soon (“Mr. Toh”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Roy Lim Jun Hao (“Mr. Lim”), TOGL Technology’s Deputy Executive Officer, and we collectively acquired 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Eostre Bhd., a Malaysia corporation (“Eostre Bhd.”). We intend to acquire the remaining 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of Eostre Bhd. as described in more detail below under the section entitled “Eostre – Recent Changes to the Eostre Business.” Further, Eostre Bhd.’s business is discussed in detail below under the section entitled “Eostre.”
 
Yippi 
 
Industry Overview
 
An “app” is a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet device. Over the last several years, mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, have proliferated extensively around the world across a wide range of demographic groups.
 
As mobile devices have become more prevalent, the mobile apps industry has experienced corresponding growth in the number of apps published and the niches they serve, as well as the revenues they generate. We believe that there will continue to be an increase in the number of smartphones and tablets sold. In addition, Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), Samsung Group (“Samsung”), and other mobile device manufacturers have introduced new, larger, and more powerful smartphones and tablets that enable more complex apps and that allow app developers to create apps that are optimized for larger screen sizes and designed to take advantage of these devices’ advanced capabilities and functionality. We believe that the proliferation of, and technological developments, to, mobile devices will continue to drive growth in our industry for the foreseeable future.
 
Product and Market 
 
The Yippi App is a mobile application with a social media messaging focus that enables users to discover new friends as well as connect with friends and family. The Yippi App also focuses on entertainment and security. Users download the Yippi App through the Apple App Store, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store. Similar to other social media mobile apps, the Yippi App allows users to post photos and videos, watch, like, and share live events, use a beauty camera to enhance photos, and generally connect with others through chat messaging and video calls. Our chat feature allows users to use a “secret chat” function that automatically deletes text messages, voice messages, or photos sent through chat messages. We also have other features to allow chat messages to be more interactive between users, such as our “whiteboard presentation” feature that allows up to 5 users to draw on a whiteboard within the chat message.
 
Finally, through Yippi, we also offer an in-app feature called TogaGo, which enables users to search for the best price for their travel needs on an array of hotel, cruise, and flights and book and purchase these accommodations. Currently, prices are comparable to major travel applications in the market, and with this feature we have bridged these two different applications into one comprehensive application. These extensions are essentially bridged within Yippi with a link to the target platform while the user is still logged into his or her Yippi account. We also maintain a website that allows users to access TogaGo.
 

6

 
In addition to TogaGo, we also generate revenue from selling advertising, emoji stickers, and Yipps through our tipping feature called Yippi Star. As of December 1, 2020, we had 214,442 monthly active users and 120,412 daily active users on Yippi. We define a “monthly active user” as a registered user of the Yippi App who opens the Yippi App at least once during a 30-day period. We define a “daily active user” as a registered user of the Yippi App who opens the Yippi App at least once during a 24-hour period for a consecutive 30-day period. 
 
The market for our Yippi App is characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of smartphones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences. Therefore, we will be required to continuously invest capital to innovate and modify our Yippi App and publish new applications. We cannot provide assurances that we will have adequate capital to modify our Yippi App or develop new applications.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
In an effort to increase our daily active users and monthly active users, our marketing strategy focuses on three areas: (i) Market Penetration; (ii) Yippi Publicity; and (iii) Market Development. 
Market Penetration. Market Penetration focuses on engaging key opinion leaders and agencies to help increase our publicity and contests within Yippi. We also intend to engage in corporate branding on social media and increase our internet presence. 
Yippi Publicity. Yippi Publicity focuses on corporate social responsibility (such as raising money for charitable causes), awareness campaigns (to increase daily active users or to increase users’ daily activity), and live concerts and music sharing (such as engaging Malaysian singers and exclusive content for the Yippi App). We intend to have monthly events broadcast through “YippiTV” (which is a function within the Yippi App for video streaming of these publicity events). We may utilize celebrity endorsements from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. 
 
We have also engaged in a series of branding campaigns, or sponsorships, with selected corporate entities in the Asian region, specifically Southeast Asia. For example, we have partnered with AirAsia Academy in cross-promotion and sponsorship of the academy players in badminton competitions since July 2018. We also sponsored the Panagbenga Flower Festival in the Philippines in February 2019, which festival was the marketing promotion that created brand awareness of the Yippi App throughout Asia.
 
Market Development. Market Development focuses on contests within the Yippi App to connect users to each other and encourage content creation within the Yippi ecosystem. Beginning in May 2018, we have had and continue to have on-going weekly contests via the social function of the Yippi App. The contests encompass questions, quizzes, personal preferences, and favorite pictures, among others, all of which are intended to increase engagement among users through their participation of commenting and sharing on their social walls. The winners are picked based on the criteria of either most creative, most shares, or most “likes” earned. We also hold weekly contests based on the top downloaded “sticker” within the Yippi App, and the designer of the most downloaded sticker for that particular week wins $100. A sticker set may only win once in a month, and only verified sticker designers are eligible to win. Winners are from Malaysia, Indonesia, ROC Taiwan, and the Philippines. Since March 2020, we have held daily non-monetary contests ranking all live streams from Yippi users and awarding the “star of the day” to the Yippi users with the most points based on live stream unique views and rewards earned for each day. Users can create a live stream by live broadcasting to users through the Yippi App. The winner receives “Yellow Beans” (tokens) and a privilege badge (similar to a virtual trophy), with the achievements being unlocked in the winning user’s Yippi profile. Similar contests are held in the Yippi App for celebrations such as Mother’s Day (for the most likes on a photo or video submission) and National Day (for the most creative photo or video post).

7

Scientific Advisory Council. In order to further our market development, in September 2019, we established a Scientific Advisory Council (the “Council”) consisting of Dr. Beverly Rubik, Prof. Dr. Konstantin Korotkov, Deputy Director of Saint-Petersburg Federal Research institute of Physical Culture, and Erick Wayne Thompson of Subtle Energy Sciences, LLC. The members of the Council were retained to provide product ideas and advice on technologies relating to energy, lifestyle and nutrition wellness, as well as to deliver keynote speeches and attend Company events. The members of the Council were each paid an annual fee of $36,000 with additional payments for each keynote presentation. As of the date of this Amended Annual Report, all agreements with the members have expired.
Target Market
 
The Yippi App is free for users and can be downloaded through the Apple App Store, Google Play, or the Amazon App Store. We are focused on increasing our users. Currently, our users are concentrated in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The Yippi App is also available to users in the United States; however, the Toga Resonance Technology (“TRT”) feature within the Yippi App is not available to users in the United States.
Competition
 
We compete with companies that focus on mobile social engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Apple; Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”), which owns and operates the applications Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp; Tencent Holdings, Ltd., which owns and operates the application WeChat; Snap Inc., which owns and operates the application Snapchat; Google, LLC (“Google”), which owns and operates YouTube; and Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”), which owns and operates the social networking service known as Twitter, have significantly greater financial and human resources. Our competitors span from internet technology companies and digital platforms to traditional companies in print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone messaging. Additionally, our competition for engagement varies by region. The main bases on which we currently compete with competitors include engagement, partnerships, advertising, and talent.
 
We compete by attracting and retaining our users’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. We focus on constantly improving and expanding the Yippi App and related features, as described below under “New Product Development.” 
 
Finally, we also compete for advertising revenue, especially with respect to video and other highly engaging formats. We believe our ability to compete depends primarily on our reach and ability to deliver a strong return on investment to our advertisers, which is driven by our advertising products, delivery and measurement capabilities, including application programming interfaces, and other tools. The industry in which we operate is changing rapidly and we find ourselves in competition with internet-based platforms, advertising networks, and traditional media.
 
New Yippi Product Development - Subsequent to July 31, 2019
 
Between January and July 31, 2020, we launched new features within the Yippi App to enhance our user experience, including, but not limited to, new TRT features which include relieving fatigue, relaxation and rejuvenation, and enhancements to live streaming, “yellow bean” social tokens, sticker artist profiles, social gamification, leaderboard, daily login reward, “Pong Pong” social networking, web instant messaging, text translation, eShop e-commerce, TogaGo user experience and “Go Cash” rewards points, and in-app Yipps purchasing through the Apple Appstore, Google Playstore, Alipay, and Huawei. “Go Cash” rewards points can be used as credits for users to receive discounts on future bookings made through TogaGo.

We also have a number of new features and enhancements to current features in development that we plan to incorporate into the Yippi App in the future, including, but not limited to, eSports live streaming, mini videos, a portal to allow for journalists and blogger content updates, expanded travel features such as train service and airport transfers bookable through TogaGo, and other “mini-programs.” Mini-programs are “sub-applications” within the Yippi App ecosystem, which offer advanced features to users in e-commerce, task management, coupons/offers, brand page, or exclusive content from official accounts. These enhancements provide experiences that are built completely within the Yippi App, for a more complete user experience. Mini-programs are similar to separate applications but because the mini-programs are within the Yippi App, users do not need to separately download each mini-program; thus, the mini-programs do not use any additional storage space on the user’s device. Users may scan quick response, or QR, codes or input the names of the mini-programs in-app to launch them. The success of the mini-programs is dependent upon encouraging talented and independent developers to create these mini-programs that are powered by our Yipp App. We currently anticipate that our mini-programs will be publicly released in 2021. Our newest version of the Yippi App, “Yippi X” was unveiled in January 2021.
 
Yipps Agreements
 
We generate revenue from the sale of Yipps, which are the in-app credit that can be used for purchases, services and tipping within the Yippi App. We use third party entities to distribute Yipps to certain end users, pursuant to Yipps Agreements. Each Yipps Agreement provides that the company purchasing the Yipps can purchase them via a purchase order, for a price set by TOGL Technology, and then distribute the Yipps to their members / agents to be used in the Yippi App. TOGL Technology has the right to change the price of the Yipps from time to time.
 
In May 2019, TOGL Technology entered into Yipps Agreements with each of Agel Enterprise International Sdn. Bhd., Malaysian corporation (“Agel”), Toga Japan Co. Ltd., a Japanese company (“Toga Japan”), and ShenZhen DingShang Network Technology Co. Ltd., a Chinese company (“ShenZhen DingShang”), for the purchase and distribution of Yipps. However, because of COVID-19 pandemic, the Yipps Agreement with Agel was terminated in May 2020. 
 
On March 1, 2020 (as amended on July 1, 2020), TOGL Technology entered into a Yipps Agreement with Success Fortune Trading Limited, a Hong Kong company (“Success Fortune”) for the purchase and distribution of Yipps that can be used by the Yippi App users.
 
On June 1, 2020, TOGL Technology entered into a Yipps Agreement with our newly acquired, partially-owned Malaysian subsidiary, Eostre Bhd., for the purchase and distribution of Yipps that can be used by the Yippi App users.
 
Eostre – Products Sold Through Our Direct Marketing Network
 
Recent Changes to the Eostre Business 
 
We recently changed our business model for our Eostre business line by bringing the direct marketing sales activities in Asia under our newly acquired, partially-owned Malaysian subsidiary, Eostre Bhd. Beginning on June 1, 2020, independent sales agents in Malaysia and Japan can purchase our “Eostre” branded products directly from Eostre Bhd.
9

Prior Business Structure; Eostre Trademark License Agreements
 
The recent changes to the business model of our Eostre business occurred because of the prolonged effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, from 2018 until May 31, 2020, we sold our “Eostre” branded products exclusively to independent sales agents in Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, and Indonesia. We did not sell our products directly to consumers. These independent sales agents distributed our products through direct marketing networks in our principal markets. In Indonesia and Taiwan, we, through our subsidiaries, administered the sale of such products. Independent agents in Indonesia and Taiwan purchase products and earn commission through a point system. In Malaysia, the program for sales was administered by Agel, and, in Japan, by Toga Japan, an unaffiliated third party. 
 
Agel and Toga Japan each engaged independent sales agents to sell our products through their respective direct marketing networks. At no time were any of the independent sales agents of Agel or Toga Japan employed by us. In order to sell our products, we granted Agel and Toga Japan certain licensing rights to use our “Yippi App” and “Eostre” trademarks for marketing purposes pursuant to, (i) in the case of Agel, a Trademark License Agreement dated April 1, 2018, as subsequently amended on August 1, 2019 (the “Agel License Agreement”) and (ii) in the case of Toga Japan, a Trademark License Agreement dated April 1, 2019, as subsequently amended on August 1, 2019 (the “Toga Japan License Agreement” and, together with the Agel License Agreement, the “License Agreements”). The License Agreements allowed Agel and Toga Japan to administer the sales programs. As consideration for the licenses, each of Agel and Toga Japan paid us a monthly fee in the amount of $20,000 USD. We also granted our subsidiaries operating in Taiwan and Indonesia licensing rights to use our “Yippi App” and “Eostre” trademarks for marketing purposes pursuant to a Trademark License Agreement dated September 1, 2018 with TOGL Technology’s Taiwan branch and a Trademark License Agreement dated August 1, 2019 with PT Toga Indonesia. As consideration for the licenses, each of TOGL Technology and PT Toga Indonesia paid us a monthly fee in the amount of $20,000 USD.
 
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting inability of independent agents to engage with customers in person, neither Agel nor Toga Japan had been able to sell our Eostre products since February 2020. As a result, the License Agreements with Agel and Toga Japan were terminated in May 2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, TOGL Technology’s Taiwan branch requested and received a reduction to the monthly royalty fee to $10,000 per month for each of April and May 2020, and the license agreement with TOGL Technology’s Taiwan branch was terminated in June 2020.
 
Acquisition of Eostre Bhd. - Subsequent to July 31, 2019
 
In connection with the termination of the License Agreements, we decided to operate the direct sales business in Malaysia and Japan ourselves, through our subsidiary, Eostre Bhd., instead of through unaffiliated, third-parties. We anticipate that in the future all independent agents in various jurisdictions throughout Asia will eventually purchase products directly from Eostre Bhd. As a result of this new business model, we (or our subsidiaries, as applicable), hired some of Agel’s former employees to assist us in the operation of our direct marketing sales activities. 
 
In order to effectuate this new business model, we are acquiring 100% of the equity of Eostre Bhd. pursuant to two Stock Purchase Agreements, dated March 31, 2020, with Mr. Toh, Mr. Lim, and the two shareholders of Eostre Bhd. (the “Stock Purchase Agreements”), and some other related agreements (the “Acquisition”), for a purchase price of MYR 5 Million (approximately USD $1,250,000) (the “Purchase Price”). The Acquisition is subject to certain approvals by the relevant governmental authorities in Malaysia, which approvals are still being obtained by us. 
 

10

 
The Acquisition is expected to be completed in two phases to meet certain regulations under Malaysian law. In the first phase, (i) we acquired 20% of Eostre Bhd., consisting of 1,000,000 ordinary shares of stock; (ii) Mr. Toh and Mr. Lim acquired 20% (1,000,000 ordinary shares) and 25% (1,250,000 ordinary shares) of Eostre Bhd., respectively; and (iii) a current owner of Eostre Bhd. acquired the balance of 1,350,000 shares, which, combined with his current ownership of 400,000 ordinary shares, resulted in his owning 35% (1,750,000 ordinary shares) of Eostre Bhd. Mr. Toh, Mr. Lim, and the current owner of Eostre Bhd. are referred to herein as the “Individual Purchasers.” 
 
We have deposited the Purchase Price directly into the bank account of Eostre Bhd., which will be controlled by us or our designees subsequent to the closing date of the first phase. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreements, Mr. Toh, Mr. Lim, and the two original owners of Eostre Bhd. are not entitled to receive any profit in connection with the Acquisition. The Individual Purchasers executed demand notes in favor of us for their respective portions of the Purchase Price. Such demand notes bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum. In addition, the Individual Purchasers each executed a security and pledge agreement in favor of us pledging their shares in Eostre Bhd. as collateral, until such time as the second phase of the Acquisition is completed. The Individual Purchasers also granted irrevocable proxies to us to vote their shares in Eostre Bhd. until such time as the second phase of the Acquisition is completed. As such, we currently hold 100% voting control of Eostre Bhd.
 
In the second phase of the Acquisition, set to begin on February 21, 2021, the promissory notes issued by the Individual Purchasers will be cancelled and deemed paid in full, and the remaining 80% of the equity in Eostre Bhd. will be transferred to us. The second phase of the Acquisition is expected to close as soon as practicable after the six-month anniversary of the signing date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, based on the expected timing required to obtain the necessary approvals from the Malaysian Ministry of Trade.
 
At the time of the of completion of the first phase of the Acquisition, Eostre Bhd. was considered a shell entity with no current business or operations. Its sole asset is a direct selling license (the “License”) to operate a business in the “direct sales” space in Malaysia. Subject to the “Direct Sales and Anti-Pyramid Scheme Act 1933,” this License is a pre-requisite to operating a company in the direct sales space in Malaysia. The expiration date of the License is November 21, 2021; however, we anticipate that we will renew the License at such time. The License will allow us to operate the direct sales business directly, instead of through unaffiliated, third-parties. 
 
Business in China
 
On June 1, 2020, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement (the “ShenZhen Yi Yi Collaboration Agreement”) with ShenZhen Yi Yi Technology Private Limited, a company registered in China (“ShenZhen Yi Yi”), for provision of certain services to us and our subsidiaries within the territory of the Peoples’ Republic of China (the “Territory”). The ShenZhen Yi Yi Collaboration Agreement memorialized the parties’ understanding with respect to the provisions of these services, which began in March 2020. Pursuant to the ShenZhen Yi Yi Collaboration Agreement, within the Territory, ShenZhen Yi Yi agreed to provide us with web hosting services, launch and release our apps, act as our exclusive proxy to promote our products and services, protect our trademarks, products and apps from unauthorized use, and make payments on behalf of the company to third-parties. The ShenZhen Yi Yi Collaboration Agreement grants ShenZhen Yi Yi a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable right to use our trademarks. In consideration for the aforementioned services, we agreed to pay ShenZhen Yi Yi monthly consideration of RMB 200,000. Pursuant to a letter of authorization, dated March 1, 2020, which had the effect of amending the ShenZhen Yi Yi Collaboration Agreement, TOGL Technology granted ShenZhen Yi Yi the right to sell Yipps to users in the Territory, with 30% of the total amount of the selling price for such Yipps sold payable to ShenZhen Yi Yi as commission. In addition, on June 1, 2020, Eostre Bhd. also began collaborating with ShenZhen YiYi for the sale of Eostre Bhd.’s products in the Territory. This collaboration has not been memorialized in writing yet between Eostre Bhd. and ShenZhen YiYi.

Industry Overview
 
Since the 1990s, the use of direct selling and network marketing sales channels has grown in popularity and general acceptance, including acceptance by prominent investors and capital investment groups who have invested in direct selling companies. In addition, many large corporations have diversified their marketing strategy by entering the direct selling arena. Several consumer-product companies have launched their own direct selling businesses with international operations and often accounting for the majority of their revenues. Consumers and investors are beginning to realize that direct selling provides unique opportunities and a competitive advantage in today’s markets. Businesses like us are able to quickly communicate and develop strong relationships with our customers, bypass expensive ad campaigns, and introduce products and services that would otherwise be difficult to promote through traditional distribution channels such as retail stores. 
 
According to the worldwide direct sales data published by the World Federation of Direct Selling Association, in 2019, approximately 118 million global direct sellers collectively generated annual retail sales of $180.4 billion, of which approximately 44% of total annual sales, or $78.9 billion, are generated in the Asia/Pacific marketplace by approximately 68.4 million independent sales agents operating in the Asia/Pacific marketplace.
 
Products and Market
 
Beginning on June 1, 2020, we sell our Eostre products directly to independent sales agents, that then sell to their customers through direct marketing networks. Prior to June 1, 2020, we licensed the “Eostre” brand to Agel and Toga Japan, both of which had direct marketing networks in Malaysia and Japan. We also sold Eostre products directly to independent sales agents to sell within the agents’ own networks in Taiwan and Indonesia. We continue to rely on the revenues generated from our Eostre business to sustain the development of our Yippi App. 
 
Our Eostre products are based on traditional, eastern wellness principles. We sell both physical products and digital products online (eostre.biz), through our “E-Booster” App, and through direct marketing networks. Our products include pendants (necklaces with crystals on them), home goods, personal care products (supplements, topical sprays, serums, and creams), and digital downloads. We offer the following physical products:

We also offer digital downloads and applications that use our “Toga-Resonance Technology” (“TRT”). TRT is part of our wellness program and is designed to be a solution for electric and magnetic field (“EFM”) radiation, or emissions from wireless products or powered items. For example, our “headache” program application includes soothing nature sounds with video and a digital image for a user to use as his or her phone wallpaper. 
 
Our TRT digital downloads are available online at eostre.biz and through our Yippi App (for our non-U.S. users) and our “E-Booster” App (branded as “eT-RT” when delivered in connection with our Eostre brand), although such digital products are not available to users located in the United States. E-Booster is a digital wellness app that delivers wellness-focused digital downloads of images, audio, and videos to users’ electronic devices, which are also available for download on the eostre.biz website.
 
Marketing Strategy 
 
We, and our subsidiaries, rely on our network of independent sales agents to sell our Eostre branded products in our various jurisdictions. The independent sales agents are eligible to receive compensation on a number of different levels, ranging from retaining profit from retail sales to bonuses, which may be achieved as each such agent becomes a leader of their own network. 
 
Independent sales agents purchase points packages from the Company, which can be used to purchase packages of products to then be sold to end users. Independent sales agents also distribute points that they have purchased from the Company to other independent sales agents within their direct marketing networks (their down-line, as described below), who then also use such points to purchase packages of products and then sell such product to end users.
 
Enrolling new independent sales agents creates multiple levels in our direct selling structure. The independent sales agents that are enrolled by other independent sales agents within our network are referred to as “sponsored” independent sales agents, who may purchase product with their points packages solely for their own personal consumption, for resale, or both. Persons newly enrolled are assigned into network positions that can be “under” other independent sales agents, and thus they can be called “down-line” independent sales agents. If down-line independent sales agents also enroll new independent sales agents, they create additional levels within the structure, but their down-line independent sales agents remain in the same down-line network as the original independent sales agent that introduced them to our business.
 
While we provide informational brochures and other sales materials, independent sales agents are primarily responsible for enrolling and educating their new down-line sales agents with respect to products, the compensation plan and how to build a successful direct marketing network.
 
Independent sales agents are not required to enroll other sales agents as their down-line, and we do not pay any commissions for enrolling new independent sales agents. Enrollment in our direct marketing network is contingent upon an independent sales agent purchasing a points package. However, because of the financial incentives provided to those who succeed in building a direct marketing network that consumes and resells products, we believe that many of our independent sales agents attempt, with varying degrees of effort and success, to enroll additional sales agents in their respective direct marketing networks.

Our Company policies and procedures establish the rules that independent sales agents must follow in each market. Independent sales agents’ presentations to customers must be consistent with, and limited to, the product claims and representations made in our literature. Independent sales agents are not entitled to use our trademarks or other intellectual property without our prior consent. If we are made aware of unapproved materials being used, we notify and direct the relevant independent sales agents to cease using such materials. We provide training materials to our independent sales agents to ensure compliance with our Company policies and to prevent unauthorized publications and/or sales practices from independent sales agents. An example of such a training and compliance presentation for independent sales agents was included in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K/A, filed on June 9, 2020, as Exhibits 99.1 (“The Importance of Optimization and Compliance”) and 99.2 (“A country we have national laws, at home we have house rules”).
 
In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate that Eostre Bhd.’s independent sales agents will primarily use e-commerce as their main sales channel. We intend to pursue paid marketing opportunities, such as Facebook ads with targeting marketing, and hiring product ambassadors to promote our products. In addition, we intend to pursue organic marketing strategies such as using social media accounts and search engine optimization to promote the products.
 
Target Market
 
Independent sales agents sell our products to wellness-minded consumers, typically adults between the ages of 20 and 80 years old, within their sales network. These consumers include both men and women, located in urban centers throughout Asia, including in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Competition
 
We purchase white labeled products and brand them with the “Eostre” trademark. We then produce sales and marketing materials for such products. Because we own the Eostre brand, we have no competitors selling identically branded products without our authorization. However, we do not own the underlying intellectual property to the products that we sell, nor do we have exclusive rights to sell such products. We have competition risk in that we cannot ensure that we will continue to be able to source our products from our third-party suppliers, at competitive prices.
 
In addition, we are aware that those third-party suppliers sell the same white labeled products to other companies (with different branding applied), who compete directly or indirectly with us in our principal markets. Except for the “Eostre” product branding and marketing, we are aware of one such competitor who sells identical products (with the competitor’s own marketing and branding applied to the underlying product) to the Eostre Energy Crystal Pendant, Eostre Vitality Pendant, Eostre Quantum Disc, Eostre Ohrus, Eostre Life Force Diffuser, Essential Young Serum, and Perfect Hydrating Spray. This provides additional direct sales competition with respect to those products and provides competition for talent for those independent sales agents who may want to sell these or similar wellness products through a direct marketing network.
 
Furthermore, we have competition in each jurisdiction in which we operate with the entire market of other companies and individuals who sell health and wellness products, especially those that are in the business of selling natural products (including crystals, topical sprays, serums and cremes, home goods, supplements, and similar items) based on traditional, eastern wellness principles.

Manufacturing
 
The Eostre products are manufactured by unaffiliated third-party companies, who ship finished products containing our Eostre branding. We receive fully manufactured products from the manufacturers, which we sell through wholesale distribution to independent sales agents who have their own respective direct marketing networks for selling the products.
Collaboration Agreements
 
From time to time, TOGL Technology enters into collaboration agreements with third parties to allow such parties to provide their services or sell their products on the Yippi App or in connection with Eostre products or the E-Booster App.
 
On May 1, 2020, we entered into a Supplier Agreement (the “Subtle Supplier Agreement”) with Subtle Energy Sciences, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (“Subtle”), where Subtle agreed to provide us with an “Immunity” app developed by Subtle which included digital files, videos, audio files and images.

Redbox may also promote its product, including providing discounts or promotions within the Yippi App. Both parties also have agreed to collaborate to expand each party’s respective business. The Redbox Collaboration Agreement grants a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable right to use our Yippi trademarks, and we have a reciprocal right to use Redbox’s trademarks. The trademarks are not to be used for any purpose other than the purpose of the Redbox Agreement without our, or Redbox’s, prior written consent, as applicable. Only Yipps can be used for paying for Redbox services or products, such as paying for karaoke rooms. Redbox pays TOGL Technology a portion of each transaction that utilized Yipps as the payment form. Each unit of Yipps is equivalent to RM 0.60, however, the value of each unit may be changed from time to time in the discretion of TOGL Technology. The initial term of the Redbox Collaboration Agreement expires on June 1, 2021 and automatically renews for an additional one-year term, unless either party provides notice to the other of its intention not to renew at least 30 days prior to the end of the initial term. Pursuant to the Redbox App Development Agreement, TOGL Technology provides development and servicing of a social karaoke app for Redbox, and, in exchange, Redbox will pay TOGL Technology RM 1,000,000.00 for such services, payable in installments upon completion of certain milestones as set forth in the Redbox App Development Agreement.

Advertising Agreements
 
During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, we entered into agreements with six different companies to provide advertising services for them on our Yippi app. Pursuant to these agreements, we generated an aggregate of approximately $100,000 per month. As of January 29, 2021, five of these agreements are still in effect.
Intellectual Property
 
“Toga” Name
 
Historically, we have not sought any intellectual property protection with respect to “Toga,” nor have we attempted to stop third-parties from using the word “Toga” in their names. We are currently pursuing a trademark for our Company name in connection with our slogan, “TOGA We Build The Next Generation,” in Malaysia and the Philippines.
Yippi App
 
We are the registered owner of certain trademarks in Malaysia, Indonesia, and China, including, but not limited to the trademark “Yippi,” and the Yippi App “Duck” logo, and we are pursuing trademark registrations in additional jurisdictions. We have registered trademark for “TogaGo” in Malaysia and are pursuing trademark registrations in additional jurisdictions. We regard our marks as important to our business due to name recognition. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our marks.

17

Eostre
 
The product branding “Eostre” is owned by us. We have a registered trademark for “Eostre” in Malaysia and are pursuing trademark registrations in additional jurisdictions. Until May 31, 2020, we licensed the brand “Eostre” to third-party companies with direct marketing networks in Malaysia and Japan (as described above), while we sold branded products directly to independent sales agents to sell within the agents’ own networks in Taiwan and Indonesia. Since June 1, 2020, the Company only sells branded products directly to independent sales agents to sell within the agents’ own networks located throughout Asia, including in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
 
On June 1, 2020, we entered into an intercompany agreement granting a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferrable license to our trademarks to our partially-owned subsidiary, Eostre Bhd. (the “Eostre Bhd. Intercompany Agreement”). Pursuant to the Eostre Bhd. Intercompany Agreement, Eostre Bhd. may use our trademarks on products that will be manufactured, sold, and/or distributed by Eostre Bhd., on marketing materials, and for events organized by Eostre Bhd. The term of the Eostre Bhd. Intercompany Agreement is one year, with the agreement automatically renewing for additional one-year terms, unless either party provides notice to the other of its intention to terminate the license agreement within 60 days before the beginning of the next term. In consideration for the license, Eostre Bhd. will pay us a fee of $20,000 on a monthly basis.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries that involves matters central to our business, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export, and national security. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted or applied in ways that could limit our business or require us to make certain fundamental and potentially detrimental changes to the products and services we offer. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third-parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright, and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. Furthermore, the introduction of new products or services in our existing markets and the expansion of our business to other countries may subject us to additional laws and regulations, among others resulting from the need to obtain additional licenses and approvals to conduct our businesses as envisioned. 
 
Our Eostre and TRT products are not currently offered in the United States. Should we choose to do so, we will have to comply with all rules and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The processes by which regulatory approvals are obtained from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to market and sell a new product are complex, require a number of years, depend upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources for research, development, and testing. In addition, if we were to market our products in additional foreign jurisdictions, we may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals in each country. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.

On January 4, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued “Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing” a non-binding guidance in question-and-answer format clarifying the FTC’s enforcement position regarding multi-level marketing. The guidance focuses on the characteristics of multi-level marketing and delineates the factors that the FTC staff is likely to consider in assessing whether or not a compensation structure is unlawful. The FTC has broad enforcement authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) to prohibit “unfair and deceptive” acts and practices. While the FTC’s guidance regarding multi-level marketing does not have the force of law and is not binding on the FTC or a court, the FTC will rely on such guidance in order to determine whether a compensation structure is unfair or deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. As a result, the FTC could decide to investigate or bring an enforcement action regarding practices that we interpret to be in line with applicable law and/or FTC guidance. For example, the FTC has challenged the distributor compensation plans used by other multi-level-marketing companies over the last few years. The FTC obtained consent decrees with those companies requiring those companies to (i) discontinue using all, or certain components of, their compensation plans; and (ii) implement a compensation plan that received prior approval from the FTC. 
 
In 2019, the FTC continued to challenge compensation plans and structures within the direct selling channel. In October 2019, following ongoing discussions with the FTC pertaining to an enforcement action, one of our competitors changed its business model from multi-level-marketing to direct-to-consumer as part of a stipulated order for permanent injunction. While consent decrees and orders entered into by our competitors are not binding on us, it does provide an insight into the FTC’s priorities regarding its interpretation and enforcement of regulations pertaining to the multi-level-marketing business model. 
 
The FTC also scrutinizes and has challenged false and misleading claims made by multi-level-marketing programs about the health benefits of the products being sold and about the earnings people who participate in a multi-level marketing program have made under its broad Section 5 authority. Since March 2020, the FTC has sent numerous warning letters to multi-level marketers about health claims and income earning claims that the FTC believes are false and deceptive. We do not believe our Eostre business is subject to the laws of the United States; however, it is possible that our interpretation of the laws is incorrect.
 
Concentration of Customer Risk
 
In fiscal 2019, we had sales to one customer that comprised an aggregate of approximately 23% of our annual revenue. In fiscal 2018, we had sales to two customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 88% of our annual revenue, with one customer at 45% of our sales and another customer at 43% of our sales.
 
In fiscal 2019, 96% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 51% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Malaysia and 45% in Indonesia. In fiscal 2018, 100% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 100% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Malaysia.
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2021, we had 158 employees, all full-time equivalent, with 2 in the United States, 153 located in Malaysia, 4 located in Indonesia, and 1 located in Vietnam. We also maintain a team of independent sales agents to sell Eostre branded products. Any employee additions or terminations over the next twelve months will be dependent upon our need during fiscal 2021. We have used and will continue utilizing part-time help, including interns, temporary employment agencies, and outside consultants, where appropriate, as required from time to time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
