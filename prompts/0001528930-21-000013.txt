Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are an owner and operator of franchised and franchisable businesses that continually looks to grow our portfolio of brands while utilizing our operating and capital allocation philosophies to generate strong cash flows. We have a diversified and growing portfolio of highly recognized brands that compete in the U.S. and Canada. Our asset-light business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and strong operating margins and requires limited maintenance capital expenditures. As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are highly cash flow generative with compelling unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise and company owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. We strive to create value for our stockholders by generating free cash flow and capital-efficient growth across economic cycles.
Our business lines include American Freight, The Vitamin Shoppe ("Vitamin Shoppe"), Liberty Tax Service ("Liberty Tax"), and Buddy’s Home Furnishings ("Buddy's"). As of the year ended December 26, 2020, on a combined basis, we operated 4,023 locations predominantly located in the U.S. and Canada, consisting of 2,743 franchised locations and 1,280 company run locations. Each of our companies has its own management team with significant experience in its respective industry. Additionally, we offer each of our brands a shared services platform that allows us to drive economies of scale and efficiencies. We believe our platform enables our portfolio of brands to be stronger together than they are apart. 
We believe our financial performance and business model have been resilient across economic cycles and recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our franchised business model is designed to generate consistent, recurring revenue and predictable free cash flow in order to insulate us from the operating cost variability of our franchised locations. The operating costs of franchised locations are borne by the franchisees themselves.
We believe our success is driven in large part by our mutually beneficial relationships with our individual franchisees. Our franchise programs are designed to promote consistency and we are selective in granting franchises. We are focused on partnering with franchisees who have the commitment, capability and capitalization to grow our brands. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning just one location to publicly-traded companies. 
While the specific terms of our franchise agreements vary between brands, we utilize both store-level franchise and master franchise programs. Under both types of franchise programs, franchisees supply capital by purchasing or leasing the land, building, equipment, signs, inventory and supplies. Store-level franchise agreements typically require payment to us of certain upfront fees such as initial fees paid upon opening a store, fees paid to renew the term of the franchise agreement and fees paid in the event the franchise agreement is transferred to another franchisee. Franchisees also pay monthly continuing fees based on a percentage of their store sales and are required to spend a certain amount to advertise and promote the brand. Under master franchise arrangements, we enter into agreements that allow master franchisees to operate stores as well as sub-franchise stores within certain geographic territories. Master franchisees are typically responsible for overseeing development within their territories and performing certain other administrative duties with regard to the oversight of sub-franchisees. In exchange, master franchisees retain a certain percentage of fees payable by the sub-franchisees under their franchise agreements and typically pay lower fees for the stores they operate. 
We seek to maintain healthy relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. We invest a significant amount of time working with the franchisee community on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements, standards and management techniques.
Our Brands
Our Vitamin Shoppe segment is an omni-channel specialty retailer of vitamins, minerals, herbs, specialty supplements, sports nutrition and other health and wellness products. We market approximately 700 nationally recognized brands as well as our own brands, which include The Vitamin Shoppe®, BodyTech®, True Athlete®, plnt®, ProBioCare®, Fitfactor Weight Management System® and Vthrive The Vitamin Shoppe®. We believe we offer one of the largest varieties of products among vitamin, mineral and supplement retailers, and we continue to refine our assortment with approximately 6,800 stock keeping units ("SKUs") offered in our typical store and approximately 7,200 additional SKUs available through e-commerce. Our broad product offering enables us to provide our customers with a depth of selection of products that may not be readily available at other specialty retailers or mass merchants, such as discount stores, supermarkets, drug stores and wholesale clubs. We believe our product offering and emphasis on product knowledge and customer service helps us meet the needs of our target customer and serves as a foundation for enhancing strong customer loyalty. We continue to focus on improving the customer experience through the roll-out of initiatives including increasing customer engagement and personalization, redesigning the omni-channel experience (including in stores as well as through the internet and mobile devices), growing our private brands and improving 
the effectiveness of pricing and promotions. At December 26, 2020, Vitamin Shoppe operated 719 stores in the U.S. under The Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements banners and is headquartered in Secaucus, New Jersey.
Our American Freight segment is a retail chain offering in-store and online access to furniture, mattresses, new and out-of-box home appliances and home accessories at discount prices. American Freight buys direct from manufacturers and sells direct in warehouse-style stores. By cutting out the middleman and keeping its overhead costs low, American Freight can offer quality products at low prices. American Freight provides customers with multiple payment options providing access to high-quality products and brand name appliances that may otherwise remain aspirational to some of its customers. 
American Freight also serves as a liquidation channel for major appliance vendors. American Freight operates specialty distribution centers that test every out-of-carton appliance before it is offered for sale to customers. Customers typically are covered by the original manufacturer's warranty and are offered the opportunity to purchase a full suite of extended-service plans and services. At December 26, 2020, American Freight operated 318 stores in 40 states and Puerto Rico, of which 6 locations are operated by franchisees. American Freight is headquartered in Delaware, Ohio.
Our Liberty Tax segment is one of the leading providers of tax preparation services in the United States and Canada. Our tax preparation services and related tax settlement products are offered through approximately 2,490 franchised locations and approximately 204 Company-owned offices. The majority of our offices are operated under the Liberty Tax Service brand. We also provide an online digital Do-It-Yourself tax program in the U.S. In addition to tax preparation services, we offer related financial products to our tax customers. The services and products are designed to provide streamlined tax preparation services for taxpayers who, for reasons of complexity, convenience, or the need for prompt tax refunds, seek assisted tax preparation services. 
Liberty Tax expends considerable effort to ensure that our franchisees are able to offer a complete range of tax settlement products to our customers, and to provide our customers choices in these products. We offer these products because we believe that a substantial portion of our prospective customers place significant value on the ability to monetize their expected income tax refund quicker than filing their tax return without utilizing the services of a paid tax preparer. We offer two types of tax settlement products - refund transfer products and refund-based loans to fulfill this customer need. The percentage of our customers in our U.S. offices receiving our refund transfer products was 46% for the 2020 tax season. During the 2020 tax season, we and our franchisees accounted for 1.6 million tax returns filed through our retail offices, and 0.1 million through our online tax programs.
Our Buddy's segment is a specialty retailer of high quality, name brand consumer electronic, residential furniture, appliances and household accessories through rent-to-own agreements. The rental transaction allows our customers the opportunity to benefit from the use of high-quality products under flexible rental purchase agreements without long-term obligations. At December 26, 2020, Buddy’s operated 292 locations in the United States and Guam, of which 247 locations are operated by franchisees. Buddy's is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.
Competition
Each of our brands competes in the U.S. with many well-established companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. Vitamin Shoppe competes in the highly competitive U.S. nutritional supplements retail industry. Competition is based primarily on quality, product assortment, price, customer service, convenience, marketing support and availability of new products. American Freight primarily competes with discount retailers of furniture and mattresses and with big box retailers and locally-owned appliance retailers that sell new-in-box and liquidations of their out-of-box or as-is appliances. Liberty Tax competes with tens of thousands of paid tax return preparers, including national, regional and local tax return preparation companies, regional and national accounting firms, financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as part of their businesses and online preparation services. Buddy’s competes with other national, regional and local rent-to-own businesses, including online only competitors, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. 
Business Strategy 
Our strategy is to focus on the operation and acquisition of franchise and franchisable businesses. We strive to assemble a mix of businesses that we believe provide us balance and overall economic resiliency, while also benefiting from the scale of a single franchising platform.
As a multi-brand operator, we continually look to diversify and grow our portfolio of brands either through acquisition or organic brand development. Our acquisition strategy typically targets businesses that are highly cash flow generative with compelling unit economics that can be scaled by adding franchise and company owned units, or that can be restructured to enhance performance and value to Franchise Group. 
We have established a corporate platform that enables us to deploy capital to acquire assets that may have few natural buyers but become more valuable as part of our Company. Across all businesses, we look to create operating efficiencies in order to drive incremental free cash flow while allowing the management teams of each brand to focus on growing their businesses. Furthermore, our aggregated platform of multiple brands and increased scale provides cost of capital advantages relative to financing each business alone. 
We believe our portfolio of brands will allow us to offer franchisees a variety of platforms that will allow them to diversify their investment portfolio in a local area, optimize their geographic penetration and grow their businesses. We believe our investors will benefit from sustainable franchise royalties and opportunistic franchise sales. Furthermore, we expect our refranchising strategy to create significant cash inflows to opportunistically de-lever and acquire additional brands.
Recent Developments
On December 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Furniture Factory Ultimate Holding, L.P. (“FFO”), a regional retailer of furniture and mattresses, for an all cash purchase price of $13.8 million (the "FFO Acquisition"). In connection with the FFO Acquisition, we acquired 31 operating locations which we intend to rebrand to our American Freight brand during the first quarter of 2021. 
On January 15, 2021, we completed a public offering of approximately 3.3 million shares of our 7.50% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share and liquidation preference of $25.00 per share ("Series A Preferred Stock") with net cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $79.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, an advisory fee and estimated offering expenses totaling approximately $3.2 million.
On January 25, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pet Supplies Plus (“PSP”), a leading omnichannel retail chain and franchisor of pet supplies and services, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $700.0 million from affiliates of Sentinel Capital Partners (the "PSP Acquisition"). Additionally, we estimate that the net present value of the tax benefits related to the PSP acquisition are expected to be approximately $100.0 million. In connection with the signing of the definitive acquisition agreement, we entered into commitments with our lenders for $1.3 billion in new term loan credit facilities to refinance our existing term loan and provide PSP acquisition financing. The PSP Acquisition closed on March 10, 2021.
On February 21, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement with NextPoint Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia ("Purchaser") to sell our Liberty Tax segment for a total preliminary purchase price of at least $243.0 million, consisting of approximately $182.0 million in cash and an equity interest in the Purchaser worth an estimated $61 million at the time of signing. In connection with the transaction, we are expecting to enter into a transition service agreement with the Purchaser, pursuant to which each party will provide certain transition services to each other. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021. 
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected, and likely will continue to affect, our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future. In most states, during 2020, our businesses were deemed essential and, therefore, the majority of our stores remained open during the pandemic. The highest number of temporary store closures we experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately 240 stores during the second quarter of 2020. As of December 26, 2020, and March 5, 2021, none of our stores were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we cannot predict whether our stores will remain open if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens and states and localities issue new restrictions.
While too early to fully quantify, we have not experienced a significant negative impact on our sales and profitability due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business and financial results by weakening demand for our products and services, interfering with our ability and our franchisees’ ability to operate store locations, disrupting our supply chain or affecting our ability to raise capital from financial institutions. As events are rapidly changing, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations due to uncertainties including, but not limited to, the duration of shutdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and the public’s response to the outbreak; however, we are actively managing our business to respond to the impact.
Change of Year-End
On October 1, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year-end from April 30th to the Saturday closest to December 31st of each year. The decision to change the fiscal year-end was related to our recent acquisitions to more 
closely align our operations and internal controls with that of our subsidiaries. We refer to our financial results for the period from May 1, 2019 through December 28, 2019, as the "Transition Period" in this report. 
Human Capital Resources
General
As of December 26, 2020, we employed 4,758 full-time and 3,325 part-time employees. Part-time employees work an average of fewer than 30 hours per work. The number of part-time employees fluctuates based on seasonal needs.
The success of our business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we strive to create an inclusive, diverse and supportive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to develop and grow in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs.
Corporate Culture
We are focused on creating a corporate culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be innovative and competitive. We operate in a performance-based environment where results matter and financial discipline is enforced. We strive to create a highly collaborative culture in which employees feel that their input is sought after and valued. At the same time, we believe in holding individuals accountable and endeavor to create a culture in which employees do what they say they are going to do. We believe that our culture is a long-term competitive advantage for us, fuels our ability to execute our business strategy and is a critical component of our employee talent strategy. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our goal is to cultivate an inclusive environment where human differences are valued, respected, supported and amplified. We have taken actions to recruit, retain, develop and advance a diverse and talented workforce. We are an equal opportunity employer. We respect diversity and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex, gender, gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws. Our management is dedicated to ensuring the fulfillment of this policy with respect to hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, separation, recruitment, pay and equity, access to facilities and programs, training and general treatment during employment.
Health Safety and Wellness 
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including programs that support their physical and mental health.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we consider to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, business partners and communities in which we operate. We implemented changes from all federal, state and local government mandates and regulations, including providing all of our employees personal protective equipment if they chose to work on-site, adding extensive cleaning regiments to our stores and distribution centers, and encouraging the majority of our corporate employees to work from home. Additionally, for any employee that participates in our health insurance programs, we waived all premiums if they were furloughed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. In addition to competitive salaries, these programs include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, health and wellness programs, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
