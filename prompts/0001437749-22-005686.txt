Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Blueknight is a publicly traded master limited partnership with operations in 26 states. We have the largest independent asphalt facility footprint in the nation, and through that we provide integrated terminalling services for companies engaged in the production, distribution, and handling of liquid asphalt that are providing the basic materials for the infrastructure and construction needed to maintain and expand the U.S. economy. We manage our operations through a single segment, asphalt terminalling services.
 
We previously provided integrated terminalling, gathering, and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution, and marketing of crude oil in three different operating segments: (i) crude oil terminalling services, (ii) crude oil pipeline services, and (iii) crude oil trucking services. On December 21, 2020, we announced we had entered into multiple definitive agreements to sell these segments, and these segments are presented as discontinued operations. The transaction related to the crude oil pipeline services segment closed on February 1, 2021, and the transactions relating to the crude oil trucking services segment closed on December 15, 2020, and February 2, 2021. The transaction related to the crude oil terminalling services segment closed on March 1, 2021.
 
Our Operations
 
We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in 2007. Our operating assets are owned by, and our operations are conducted through, our subsidiaries. Our General Partner has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations. Ergon owns 100% of the outstanding membership interest of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the membership interest of our General Partner.
 
Our General Partner has no business or operations other than managing our business. In addition, outside of its investment in us, our General Partner owns no assets or property. Our partnership agreement imposes no additional material liabilities upon our General Partner or obligations to contribute to us other than those liabilities and obligations imposed on general partners under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

Our Strengths and Strategies
 
Business strategy. Our strategy is to be a downstream terminalling solutions provider focused on infrastructure and transportation end-markets. During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the transformational divestitures of our three crude oil business segments. Through these divestitures, we have improved our balance sheet and achieved financial flexibility to pursue accretive growth investments. We have refocused expansion activities on core competencies and inherent competitive advantages in specialty terminalling markets. We plan to redeploy capital and maximize risk-adjusted returns in both organic and non-organic growth projects.
 
Strategically placed assets. We own 54 asphalt terminalling facilities in 26 states, consisting of approximately 9.0 million barrels of liquid asphalt storage, which we believe are well positioned to provide services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. In addition, we have a focus on leveraging this existing site footprint to increase utilization for other complementary specialty products.
 
Growth opportunities. We evaluate growth opportunities from multiple angles, including growth through third-party acquisitions and optimizing our existing asset base.
 
Experienced management team. Our General Partner has an experienced and knowledgeable management team with extensive experience as a service provider in the product handling and construction materials industries. We expect to directly benefit from this management team’s strengths, including significant relationships throughout these industries with customers of our terminalling services.

Our relationship with Ergon. Ergon owns our General Partner and therefore controls our operations. Ergon is a privately held company formed in 1954 and is based in Jackson, Mississippi, with over 3,000 employees globally. Ergon and its subsidiaries are engaged in a wide range of operations that are categorized into six primary business segments: Refining & Marketing, Specialty Chemicals, Asphalt & Emulsions, Midstream & Logistics, Oil & Gas, and Construction & Real Estate. This relationship may provide us with additional capital sources for future growth as well as increased opportunities to provide terminalling services. While this relationship may benefit us, it may also be a source of potential conflicts. Ergon is not restricted from competing with us and may acquire, construct or dispose of additional assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct those assets.
 
Asphalt Industry Overview
 
Liquid asphalt is one of the oldest engineering materials. Liquid asphalt’s adhesive and waterproofing properties have been used for building structures, waterproofing ships, and numerous other applications.
 
Production of liquid asphalt begins with the refining of crude oil. When crude oil is separated in distillation towers at a refinery, the heaviest hydrocarbons with the highest boiling points settle at the bottom. These tar-like fractions, called residuum, require relatively little additional processing to become products such as liquid asphalt. Liquid asphalt production typically represents only a small portion of the total product production in the crude oil refining process. The liquid asphalt produced by petroleum distillation can be sold by the refinery either directly into the wholesale or retail liquid asphalt markets.
 
In its normal state, liquid asphalt cement is too viscous to be used at ambient temperatures. For paving and roofing applications, asphalt cement is heated for handling and transporting to markets. Asphalt cement is generally used as straight-run asphalt cement (asphalt straight from refineries), polymer modified asphalt (PMA) or emulsified in a water base with emulsifying chemicals by a colloid mill (asphalt emulsions) and handled and transported at lower temperatures.
 
Hot mix asphalt is produced by mixing asphalt cement and heated with aggregate (stone, sand and/or gravel). The hot mix asphalt is loaded into trucks for transport to the paving site, where it is placed on the road surface by paving machines and compacted by rollers. Hot mix asphalt is used for roofing applications, new construction, reconstruction, and for thin maintenance overlay on existing roads.
 
Polymer modified asphalt is produced by mixing asphalt cement and heated with various qualities of polymers and chemicals to produce a higher quality of finished material that provides greater durability and elasticity for various markets. Polymer modified asphalt can also be included in asphalt emulsions. The polymer modified asphalt is loaded into trucks for transport to the paving site, or the hot mix facility, where it is then placed on the road surface by paving machines and compacted by rollers. Polymer modified asphalt is used for roofing applications, new construction, reconstruction, and for thin maintenance overlay on existing roads. 
 
Asphalt emulsions are used for a variety of applications, including spraying as a tack coat between an old pavement and a new hot mix asphalt overlay, cold mix pothole patching material, and preventive maintenance surface applications such as chip seals. Asphalt emulsions are also used for fog seal, slurry seal, scrub seal, sand seal and microsurfacing maintenance treatments, warm mix emulsion/aggregate mixtures, base stabilization, and in-place recycling.
 
The asphalt industry in the United States is characterized by a high degree of seasonality. Much of this seasonality is due to the impact that weather conditions have on road construction schedules, particularly in cold weather states. Refineries produce liquid asphalt year-round, but the peak asphalt demand season is during the warm weather months when most of the road construction activity in the United States takes place. Liquid asphalt marketers and finished asphalt product producers with access to storage capacity possess the inherent advantage of being able to purchase supply from refineries on a year-round basis and then sell finished asphalt products in the peak summer demand season.
 
Asphalt Terminalling Services
 
We provide asphalt terminalling services to marketers and distributors of liquid asphalt and asphalt-related products. We do not take title to the product. With approximately 9.0 million barrels of liquid asphalt cement storage capacity, we are able to provide our customers the ability to effectively manage their liquid asphalt inventories while allowing significant flexibility in their processing and marketing activities. As of March 1, 2022, we have 54 terminals located in 26 states and, as such, are well-positioned to provide asphalt terminalling services in the market areas we serve throughout the continental United States. 
 
We serve the asphalt industry by providing our customers access to their market areas through a combination of leasing our liquid asphalt facilities and providing terminalling services at certain facilities. We generate revenues by charging a fee for the lease of a facility or for services provided as asphalt products are terminalled at our facilities.
 
As of March 1, 2022, we have leases and terminalling agreements relating to all of our asphalt facilities, including 28 under contract with Ergon. Our agreements have, based on a weighted average of remaining fixed revenue, approximately 5.3 years remaining under their terms. Based on tank capacity, approximately 13% of capacity, all with third parties, expire in late 2022 if not renewed with the current customer or a new customer, and the remaining capacity expires at varying times thereafter, through 2035. We may not be able to extend, renegotiate or replace these contracts when they expire, and the terms of any renegotiated contracts may not be as favorable as the contracts they replace.

 At facilities where we have terminalling agreements, we receive, store and/or process our customers’ asphalt products until those products are ready to be delivered to our customers or other third parties. Our asphalt assets include the logistics assets, such as docks and rail spurs and the piping and pumping equipment necessary to facilitate the unloading of liquid asphalt into our terminalling and storage facilities, as well as the processing and manufacturing equipment required for the processing of asphalt emulsions, polymer modified asphalt cement, and other related finished asphalt products. After initial unloading, the liquid asphalt is moved via heat-traced pipe into storage tanks. Those tanks are insulated and contain heating elements that allow the liquid asphalt to be stored in a heated state. The liquid asphalt can then be directly sold by our customers to end users or used as a raw material for the processing of asphalt emulsions, polymer modified asphalt cement, and related finished asphalt products that we process in accordance with the formulations and specifications provided by our customers. Depending on the product, the processing of asphalt entails combining asphalt cement and various other products such as emulsifying chemicals and polymers to achieve the desired specification and application requirements. 
 
At leased facilities, our customers conduct the operations at the asphalt facility, including the storage and processing of asphalt products, and we collect a monthly rental fee relating to the lease of such facility. Generally, under the terms of those leases, (i) title to the asphalt, raw materials or finished asphalt products received, unloaded, stored, or otherwise handled at such asphalt facility is in the name of the lessee; (ii) the lessee is responsible for complying with environmental, health, safety, transportation and security laws; (iii) the lessee is required to obtain and maintain necessary permits, licenses, plans, approvals, or other such authorizations and is required to provide insurance for such asphalt facility; and (iv) most routine maintenance and repairs of such asphalt facility are the responsibility of the lessee.
 
We do not take title to or have marketing responsibility for the liquid asphalt product at terminals we operate. As a result, our asphalt operations have minimal direct exposure to changes in commodity prices, but the volumes of liquid asphalt we terminal are indirectly affected by commodity prices. 
 
The following table provides an overview of our asphalt facilities as of March 1, 2022:

Our asphalt assets range in age from one year to over 50 years, and we expect that our storage tanks and related assets will have an average remaining life in excess of 20 years.
 
Significant Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Ergon accounted for at least 40% but not more than 45% of our total asphalt terminalling services revenue. Two third-party customers each accounted for at least 10% but not more than 15% of asphalt terminalling services revenue in 2021. The loss of any of those customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during 2021. As of March 1, 2022, we have terminalling agreements or operating leases with Ergon for 28 of our asphalt facilities. For more information regarding the Ergon agreements, please see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
Competition
 
We compete with regional and local terminalling companies of widely varying sizes, financial resources, and experience. Participants range in size from major companies to small family-owned businesses. We are subject to competition from other terminalling operations that may be able to supply our customers with the same or comparable services on a more competitive basis. Our ability to compete could be harmed by factors we cannot control, including the perception that another company can provide better service or a decision by our competitors to acquire or construct asphalt terminalling assets and provide terminalling services in geographic areas, or to customers, served by our assets and services. Competition we are subject to is mitigated by our long-term contracts, the fact that we do not market products, and high barriers to entry from new construction. If we are unable to compete effectively with services offered by other asphalt terminalling companies, our financial results and ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. Additionally, we also compete with regional and local companies for asset acquisitions and expansion opportunities. Some of these competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do.
Environmental, Health and Safety Risk
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use, air emissions (including greenhouse gases), water discharges, waste management and disposal, noise, odor and dust control, and other environmental, health and safety and security matters govern our operations. Some of our operations require permits or other government-issued authorizations, which may impose additional operating standards, and are subject to modification renewal and revocation. We commit resources to achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, however the risk of liabilities, particularly environmental liabilities, is inherent in the operation of our businesses. These potential liabilities could result in material costs, including for fines or personal injury or damages claims, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.
 
Future events, including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of the products handled or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs. We could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action, like control equipment, which could be substantial, or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals.
 
Our operations are subject to manufacturing, operating, and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations, including the related storage of finished products, hazardous substances, and wastes. We are exposed to potential hazards including storage tank leaks, explosions, discharges or releases of hazardous substances, health hazard exposure, documentation and reporting failures and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery. These risks can subject us to potential liabilities relating to personal injury or death, or property damage, and may result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our productivity or profitability. We may be called upon to investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations, as well as operations we have acquired from others, or we may be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties.

Operational Hazards and Insurance
 
Terminals and similar facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance of various types and varying levels of coverage which we consider adequate under the circumstances to cover our operations and properties, including coverage for pollution-related events. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating terminals and other facilities. In 2020, we experienced increased costs as insurers are increasing premiums to ameliorate recent losses. Through the utilization of deductibles and retentions, where appropriate and efficient, we self-insure the “working layer” of loss activity to create a more efficient and cost-effective program. The working layer consists of high-frequency/low-severity losses that are best retained and managed in-house. We continue to monitor our retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 130 full-time employees. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. 
 
Financial Information about Segments
 
We operate our asphalt terminalling facilities under a single operating segment.
