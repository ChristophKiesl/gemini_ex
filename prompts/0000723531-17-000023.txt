  Services and Products
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and HR needs.  Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles.  Our payroll-related ancillary services and Human Resource Service (“HRS”) offerings often leverage the information gathered in the base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum. We were recently certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act (“SBEA”) related to our PEO offering.  We provide insurance offerings through the Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. (“PIA”) that allow employers to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services.
 Paychex Flex® is our proprietary HCM software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform through which we provide an integrated product suite that covers the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement. Paychex Flex streamlines workforce management through innovative technology and flexible choice of service. It uses a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records, and single sign-on, including self-service options and mobility applications. The HCM product suite integrates recruiting and applicant tracking, employee onboarding, payroll, employee benefits and human resource administration, time and attendance, and retirement services. In addition, Paychex Flex presents function-focused analytics throughout the platform, assisting HR leaders with making more informed business decisions.  Paychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service, with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via the multi-product service center.  In addition, large clients can utilize a relationship manager for more personalized service.  This flexible platform services our small-business clients, mid-market clients, and our PEO business.
 The integration of flexible service options and leading-edge technology allows us to meet our clients' diverse needs by providing them with information and products when, where, and how they want it.  Our Paychex mobile applications add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access and increased productivity.  Paychex Flex uses a mobile-first design throughout our HCM suite, which allows full functionality of all application components, regardless of device or screen size.  Enabling our clients and their employees to have full access to our products offers diverse capabilities and flexibility for both the employer and employee.

Small-Business Clients
 For our small-business clients, which we define as typically less than 50 employees, Paychex supports the client in reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our dynamic products and customer service for a quick and easy pay day. Small-business payroll is provided via our core payroll, utilizing our robust Paychex Flex processing platform, or SurePayroll® products.  Our core payroll clients can opt for our full-service customer service model through our branch operations or use Paychex Online Payroll®, our secure Internet portal. Paychex Online Payroll offers a suite of self-service and interactive services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Both service models offer payroll processing, employee access online, general ledger service to provide payroll information to the client’s general ledger accounting software, and access to our industry-leading, web-based report center and robust report writer. Our SurePayroll SaaS solution offers “do-it-yourself,” self-service and mobile applications for small businesses.
 With an environment of increasing regulations, the need for HR outsourcing services is moving down-market.  In particular, our small-business clients benefit from our time and attendance products, which allow them to accurately and efficiently manage the gathering and recording of employee hours worked.  Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, assist companies with the scheduling, tracking, and reporting of time.  Other Paychex solutions, such as our comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions, are also available for our small-business clients.
 Mid-Market Clients
 Our mid-market clients are typically defined as more than 50 employees with more complex payroll and employee benefit needs.  Our mid-market clients are serviced through our Paychex Flex Enterprise solution set, which offers an integrated suite of HCM solutions on the Paychex Flex platform, or through our legacy platform.  All new clients are sold on the Paychex Flex platform.  Clients using Paychex Flex Enterprise are offered a SaaS solution that integrates payroll processing with HR management, employee benefits administration, time and labor management, applicant tracking, and onboarding solutions.  Paychex Flex Enterprise allows our mid-market clients to choose the services and software they need to meet the complexity of the business and have them integrated through one HCM solution.
 Mid-market clients also have the option to select the HCM modules they need with the ability to easily add services as they grow.  They can also opt for our comprehensive HR and payroll outsourcing solutions, Paychex HR Services. This flexibility allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their particular needs.
 Description of Services
 Payroll processing:  For both our small-business and mid-market clients, payroll processing is the foundation of our portfolio of HCM services.  Payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.  Along with payroll processing, clients can also select from the following payroll-related ancillary services:
· | Payroll tax administration services: Our payroll tax administration services provide accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.

· | Employee payment services: Our employee payment services provide an employer with the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.

· | Regulatory compliance services: We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Human Resource Services: We offer complementary services for outsourcing of various HR functions to our payroll clients.  In addition, some of these services can be provided to clients who do not opt for payroll processing.  Our services are categorized as follows:

· | Paychex HR Services: We offer comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions that provide businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and employee administrative needs. Our Paychex HR Services offering is available through Paychex HR Solutions, an administrative services organization (“ASO”), or Paychex PEO. Both options offer businesses a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits package equal to that of larger companies. Our PEO differs from the ASO in that we serve as a co-employer of the clients’ employees, offer health care coverage to PEO client employees, and assume the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. PEO services are sold through our registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC, subsidiaries of which are certified to provide PEO services under the SBEA. We also offer Paychex HR Essentials, which is an ASO product that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics. As of May 31, 2017, Paychex HR Services was utilized by approximately 37,000 clients with approximately 1,021,000 client worksite employees.

· | Retirement services administration: Our retirement services product line offers a variety of options to clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These services provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services clients include relationships with financial advisors. As of May 31, 2017, retirement services covered approximately 78,000 plans and the asset value of participants' funds externally managed totaled approximately $27.4 billion.

· | Insurance services: Our licensed insurance agency, PIA, provides insurance through a variety of carriers. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet.  Our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility (“ESR”) Service is aimed at helping clients: 1) determine if the ACA’s ESR provision applies to them; 2) provide ongoing ACA analysis and monitoring, along with automatic alerts, of their employees and hours worked; 3) evaluate if their health care offering meets the minimum coverage requirement; and 4) prepare end-of-year reporting.
 PIA has a website, www.paychexinsurance.com, with information and interactive tools to help educate visitors on insurance and aid in making business insurance decisions.   A section on this website is designed to provide answers, information, and solutions that employers can use to prepare for and take action to comply with health care reform.

· | HR administration services: We offer cloud-based HR administration software products for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance solutions, and recruiting. Paychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits, personnel information, and HR compliance and reporting. Our BeneTrac service manages the employee-benefit enrollment process. Our time and attendance products, including our integrated FlexTime® software, provides timekeeping, scheduling, and workforce analytics. These services allow the employer to handle multiple payroll scenarios, improving productivity, accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. Our expense reporting solution is a web-based solution that provides clients with tools to manage and control the expense reporting process. The applicant tracking suite provides technology that streamlines, simplifies, and drives the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes.

· | Other human resource services and products: We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other HRS products include employee handbooks, management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms. These products are designed to simplify clients’ office processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

  Accounting and Financial Services:  We offer various accounting and financial services to small- to medium-sized businesses.  These services offer additional value-added benefits for small-business owners. Paychex Advance, LLC was established in December 2015 with the acquisition of Advance Partners and offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation.  In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for services such as payment processing services, financial fitness programs, and a small-business loan resource center.    Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve.  Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services. Within payroll, we differentiate the markets we serve between small-business and mid-market companies.  Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs.  We utilize a virtual sales force to service geographical areas where we may not have a local presence, cover inbound leads for certain small-business clients, or for products for which we do not have a local sales force.  We sell HRS products to both new clients and our existing client base.
 In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client referrals.  Approximately 55% of our new  small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources.  Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services.
 We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business SolutionsTM Program.  Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2021.  We also partner with various state CPA society organizations.
 Our website, which is available at www.paychex.com, includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information.  It also serves as a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct sales force. This online tool allows us to market to clients and prospective clients in other geographical areas where we do not have a direct sales presence. In addition, our insurance services website, which is available at www.paychexinsurance.com,  provides information to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact with one of our professional insurance agents.

Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impacts of regulatory change. We track current regulatory issues that impact the small business community and provide a monthly regulatory update. Our  Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals.  The BuildMyBiz® website, which is available at www.BuildMyBiz.com, provides convenient collections of information, tools, and services on challenges facing entrepreneurs.
 Markets and Competition
 We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 12 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the U.S. Of those businesses, approximately 99% have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market. The average client size within our existing client base is approximately 16.0 employees.  We believe that there is opportunity for us in the HCM market as the demand is moving down-market to smaller businesses.
 We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the U.S. and in Germany.  Revenue from operations in Germany and long-lived assets in Germany are not material. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), client retention was approximately 81% of our beginning of the year client base, a slight decrease from the prior fiscal year’s near-record-high level. No single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations.
 The market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of which we believe have significantly fewer clients than us. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. HRS products also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, and HR and benefits consulting firms.
 Competition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas.  We believe that our excellent customer service, together with our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, distinguishes us from our competitors.
 Software Maintenance and Development
 The ever-changing mandates of Federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience.  Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. Employees
 As of May 31, 2017, we employed approximately 13,700 people.  None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
 Intellectual Property
 We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.

Seasonality
 There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new Paychex HR Services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors, our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter.
