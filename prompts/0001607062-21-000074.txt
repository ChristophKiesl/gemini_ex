OUR COMPANY
 
Introduction
 
The Company is a technology-enabled, risk-bearing population health management company that manages provider networks. Our primary focus has been on the medical technology markets and the growth of our subsidiary Clinigence Health Inc. (“Clinigence Health”). With the recent acquisitions of Accountable Healthcare Americas, Inc. (“AHA”) and AHP Management, Inc. (“AHP”) the Company’s focus is expanding to the seeking additional acquisitions of risk-bearing organizations, including Management Service Organizations (MSO), Independent Practice Associations (IPA) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) that are principally serving Medicare Advantage Plans or CMS Primary Care initiatives.
Clinigence Health’s Platform Services
 
Clinigence Health is a healthcare information technology company providing a cloud-based platform that enables healthcare organizations to provide value-based care and population health management (PHM). Our proprietary cloud-based PHM platform extracts claims and clinical data from multiple claims and EHR systems, which it then uses to report clinical quality measures (GPRO, MIPS, etc.), gaps in care, risk-stratification of patients, generates a utilization dashboard on every provider, has predictive analytics and a provider scorecard. The Clinigence Health platform provides turnkey SaaS solutions that enable connected intelligence across the care continuum by transforming massive amounts of data into actionable insights. Clinigence Health’s solutions help healthcare organizations improve the quality and cost effectiveness of care, enhance population health management and optimize provider networks.

The Company’s solutions help healthcare organizations improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of care, enhance population health management and optimize provider networks. The Company enables risk-bearing healthcare organizations to achieve their objectives on the path to value-based care.
 
Competitive Comparison
 
Clinigence Health has a pending patent application for its technology (U.S. Patent Application No. 15/882,688). Clinigence Health believes its technology is unique in two critical ways: (1) it efficiently integrates data from any EHR and claims sources; and (2) it enables clinicians to target any patient population and measure any clinical key performance indicator in real time with no dependence on EHR vendors, information technology or informatics staff.
Customers
 
Clinigence Health’s services have been utilized by more than 1,000 health care practices, including some 14 accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), 7 Managed Services Organizations (“MSOs”), 5 health plans, 35 hospitals, and over 8,000 individual providers, and hosting more than 9 million patient records. In 2020, the largest three customers of the Company represented 36.83% of revenues during that period and in 2021 we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from these same three customers.
Expansion Summary

Lauderdale, Florida and founded in 2017 by industry veterans with a combined 125 years of experience in the Medicare managed care space, AHA is a medical management platform company that currently has an investment in an accountable care organization with approximately 16,000 Medicare members through a network of over 65 providers.

AHP Acquisition
 
Based in Los Angeles, California and founded in 2000, AHP Management, Inc.’s affiliated medical group, AHP IPA, currently provides care for 22,065 patients, including approximately 1800 Medicare Advantage patients, through a network of 141 primary care physicians and 660 specialists. AHP Management’s affiliated medical group, AHP IPA, has become a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of Clinigence in order to be compliant with California’s corporate practice of medicine regulations.
 
Expansion of Platform
 
Clinigence Health’s objective is to be a market leader in providing a world class software application as well as expand our offering to current and new customers, including healthcare practitioners, ACOs, MSOs.
Summary
 
The combination of the three companies fuses a healthcare information technology company with medical management companies to form a unique, scalable operating platform that we believe is well positioned for the ongoing transition of U.S. healthcare from fee-for-service payments to value-based reimbursements, including full-risk, global capitation models. The platform also addresses another major theme in U.S. healthcare: faced with mounting costs, shifting regulations and burdensome billing, reporting and technology requirements, many physicians and medical groups have been selling their practices to larger hospital systems. The strategy of the combined company is to be one of the few, technology-enabled national medical groups by acquiring and/or operating medical groups, independent practice associations (“IPAs”), accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), management services organizations (“MSOs”) and individual practices, allowing providers to focus on providing the best quality of care to their patients.
Regulatory Environment
 
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:

• | the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Anti-Kickback Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;

Our revenue will be dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.
 
HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which includes us.
 
Because of the extreme sensitivity of the PII we store and transmit, the security features of our technology platform are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive client and patient data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI.

We presently have 14 total employees all of whom are full-time for operations.
