three segments: Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Illinois Transmission. 
An illustration of Ameren and Ameren Illinois' reporting structures is provided below. For additional information on 


reporting segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 – Segment Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report. 


(a) Ameren Transmission segment includes associated Ameren (parent) interest charges. It also includes Ameren Transmission Company, LLC, ATX East, LLC and ATX Southwest, LLC. 
RATES AND REGULATION
Rates
The rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in the process of getting new rates approved, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for 


each of Ameren's electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution businesses experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including the use of a future test year, the implementation of trackers and riders, the level and timing of expenditures, and regulatory frameworks that include annual revenue requirement reconciliations. 
The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois, as well as non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the ICC does not have authority to regulate ATXI's rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri's, Ameren Illinois', and ATXI's cost-based rates for the wholesale transmission and distribution of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.


The following table summarizes, by rate jurisdiction, the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren's rate-regulated utilities as of January 1, 2017:

 | Rate Regulator | AllowedReturn on Equity | Percent ofCommon Equity | Rate Base(in billions) | Portion of Ameren's 2016 Operating Revenues(a)
Ameren Missouri | | | | | 
Electric service(b)(c) | MoPSC | 9.53% | 51.8% | $7.0 | 55% 
Natural gas delivery service(d) | MoPSC | (d) | 52.9% | $0.2 | 2% 
Ameren Illinois | | | | |

Electric transmission service(g) | FERC | 10.82% | 56.3% | $1.1 | 2% 


(a) | Includes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and natural gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations.


(b) | Ameren Missouri's electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate.


(c) | Based on the MoPSC's April 2015 rate order. Pending MoPSC approval of a stipulation and agreement filed in February 2017, Ameren Missouri may have new electric service rates effective on or before March 20, 2017. The February 2017 stipulation and agreement did not specify the common equity percentage, the rate base, or the allowed return on common equity.


(d) | Based on the MoPSC's January 2011 rate order. This rate order did not specify the allowed return on equity. It includes the impacts on rate base and operating revenues relating to the ISRS for investments after the January 2011 rate order.


(e) | Based on the ICC's December 2016 rate order. Ameren Illinois electric distribution delivery service rates are updated annually and become effective each January. The December 2016 rate order was based on 2015 recoverable costs, expected net plant additions for 2016, and the monthly yields during 2015 of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Ameren Illinois' 2017 electric distribution delivery service revenues will be based on its 2017 actual recoverable costs, rate base, common equity percentage, and return on common equity, as calculated under the IEIMA's performance-based formula ratemaking framework.


(f) | Based on the ICC's December 2015 rate order. The rate order was based on a 2016 future test year and established the VBA.


(g) | Transmission rates are updated annually and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking rate formula based on each year's forecasted information. The 10.82% return, which includes the 50 basis points incentive adder for participation in an RTO, could be lowered by a FERC complaint proceeding that is challenging the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners and will require customer refunds if the FERC approves the administrative law judge's decision in the February 2015 complaint case.

Ameren Missouri
Ameren Missouri’s electric operating revenues are subject to regulation by the MoPSC. If certain criteria are met, Ameren Missouri’s electric rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. For example, Ameren Missouri's MEEIA customer energy efficiency program costs, net shared benefits or throughput disincentive, and any performance incentive are recoverable through a rider that may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding, subject to MoPSC prudence reviews. Likewise, the FAC permits Ameren Missouri to recover or refund, through customer rates, 95% of changes in net energy costs greater than or less than the amount set in base rates without a traditional rate proceeding, subject to MoPSC prudence reviews. Net energy costs, as defined in the FAC, include fuel and purchased power costs, including transportation, net of off-system sales. Under certain conditions, a provision of the FAC allows Ameren Missouri to retain a portion of the revenues from any off-system sales it makes as a result of reduced sales to the New Madrid Smelter. 
In addition to the FAC and the MEEIA recovery mechanisms, Ameren Missouri employs other cost recovery mechanisms, including a pension and postretirement benefit cost tracker, an uncertain tax position tracker, a renewable energy standards cost tracker, and a solar rebate program tracker. Each of these trackers allows Ameren Missouri to record the difference between the level of incurred costs under GAAP and the level of such costs included in rates as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, which will be included in base rates in a subsequent MoPSC rate order. 


Ameren Missouri is a member of MISO, and its transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission service. The transmission rate update each June is based on Ameren Missouri’s filings with the FERC. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers because, in Missouri, bundled retail rates include an amount for transmission-related costs and revenues. 
Ameren Missouri’s natural gas operating revenues are subject to regulation by the MoPSC. If certain criteria are met, Ameren Missouri’s natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas supply costs to be passed directly to customers. The ISRS also permits certain prudently incurred natural gas infrastructure replacement costs to be recovered from customers on a more timely basis between rate cases. The return on equity currently used by Ameren Missouri for purposes of the ISRS tariff is 10%. 
Ameren Illinois
Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution
Ameren Illinois' electric distribution delivery service operating revenues are regulated by the ICC. In 2016, Ameren Illinois' electric distribution delivery service revenues accounted for 89% of Ameren Illinois' total electric operating revenues. 
Ameren Illinois participates in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA. 


7

The IEIMA was designed to provide for the recovery of actual costs of electric delivery service that are prudently incurred and to reflect the utility's actual regulated capital structure through a formula for calculating the return on equity component of the cost of capital. The return on equity component of the formula rate is equal to the calendar year average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The IEIMA provides for an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement necessary to reflect the actual costs incurred in a given year with the revenue requirement included in customer rates for that year, including an allowed return on equity. This annual revenue requirement reconciliation adjustment will be collected from or refunded to customers within two years. 
The FEJA revised certain portions of the IEIMA, including extending the IEIMA formula ratemaking process through 2022, and clarifying that a common equity ratio of up to and including 50% is prudent. Also, beginning in 2017, the FEJA decouples electric distribution revenues established in a rate proceeding from actual sales volumes by providing that any revenue changes driven by actual electric distribution sales volumes differing from sales volumes reflected in that year's rates will be collected from or refunded to customers within two years. This portion of the law extends beyond the end of the IEIMA in 2022. Through 2022, revenue differences will be included in the annual IEIMA revenue requirement reconciliation. Additionally, this law creates a customer surcharge relating to certain nuclear energy centers located in Illinois that, like the cost of power purchased by Ameren Illinois on behalf of its customers, will be passed through to electric distribution customers with no effect on Ameren Illinois' earnings.
Ameren Illinois is also subject to performance standards under the IEIMA. Failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company's allowed return on equity calculated under the formula. The performance standards include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, a reduction in the number of estimated bills, a reduction of consumption on inactive meters, and a reduction in uncollectible accounts expense. The IEIMA provides for return on equity penalties totaling up to 34 basis points through 2018 and up to 38 basis points in 2019 through 2022 if the performance standards are not met. 
Under the IEIMA, Ameren Illinois is also subject to capital spending levels. Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren Illinois is required to invest a total of $625 million in capital projects to modernize its distribution system incremental to its average annual electric distribution service capital projects of $228 million for calendar years 2008 through 2010. Through 2016, Ameren Illinois has invested $383 million in IEIMA capital projects toward its $625 million requirement. 
Ameren Illinois employs cost recovery mechanisms for power procurement, customer energy efficiency program costs, certain environmental costs, and bad debt expense not recovered in base rates. Ameren Illinois also has a tariff rider to recover the costs of certain asbestos-related claims. 


Ameren Illinois Natural Gas
Ameren Illinois’ natural gas operating revenues are regulated by the ICC. In December 2015, the ICC issued a rate order that approved an increase in revenues for Ameren Illinois' natural gas delivery service based on a 2016 future test year. The rate order also approved the VBA for residential and small nonresidential customers. If certain criteria are met, Ameren Illinois’ natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding as PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to customers. Also, Ameren Illinois employs cost recovery mechanisms for customer energy efficiency program costs, certain environmental costs, and bad debt expenses not recovered in base rates.
Illinois has a law that encourages natural gas utilities to accelerate modernization of the state's natural gas infrastructure through a QIP rider. Ameren Illinois' QIP rider allows a surcharge to be added to customers' bills to recover depreciation expenses and to earn a return on qualifying natural gas investments that were not previously included in base rates. Recovery begins two months after the natural gas investments are placed in service and continues until the investments are included in base rates in a future natural gas rate order. 
Ameren Illinois Transmission
Ameren Illinois' transmission operating revenues are regulated by the FERC. In 2016, Ameren Illinois' transmission service revenues accounted for 11% of Ameren Illinois' electric operating revenues. See Ameren Transmission below for additional information regarding Ameren Illinois' transmission business.
Ameren Transmission
Ameren Transmission is primarily composed of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Both Ameren Illinois and ATXI are members of MISO; their transmission rates are calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The FERC-allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners of 12.38% was challenged by customer groups in two complaint cases filed in November 2013 and in February 2015. In September 2016, the FERC issued a final order in the November 2013 complaint case, which lowered the allowed base return on common equity to 10.32%, or a 10.82% total return on common equity with the inclusion of the 50 basis point adder for participation in an RTO. This September 2016 order required the issuance of customer refunds, with interest, for the 15-month period ended February 2015. The refunds are expected to be issued in the first half of 2017. The new allowed return on common equity is reflected in rates prospectively from the September 2016 effective date of the order. In June 2016, an administrative law judge issued an initial decision in the February 2015 complaint case, which if approved by FERC, would lower the allowed base return on common equity to 9.70%, or a 10.20% total return on equity with the inclusion of the 50 basis point incentive adder for participation in an RTO. It would also require the issuance of customer refunds, with interest, for the 15-month period ended May 2016. The FERC is 


8

expected to issue a final order in the February 2015 complaint case in the second quarter of 2017. That final order will determine the allowed return on common equity for the 15-month period ended May 2016. That final order will also establish the allowed return on common equity that will apply prospectively from its expected second quarter 2017 effective date, replacing the current 10.82% total return on common equity, which became effective in September 2016.
Ameren Illinois and ATXI have received FERC approval to use a company-specific, forward-looking rate formula framework in setting their transmission rates. These forward-looking rates are updated each January with forecasted information. A reconciliation during the year, which adjusts for the actual revenue requirement and actual sales volumes, is used to adjust billing rates in a subsequent year. Ameren Illinois Transmission earns revenue from transmission service provided to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. The transmission expense for Illinois customers who have elected to purchase their power from Ameren Illinois is recovered through a cost recovery mechanism with no net effect on Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings, as costs are offset by corresponding revenues. Transmission revenues from these transactions are reflected at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Transmission. 
The FERC has approved transmission rate incentives relating to the three MISO-approved multi-value projects discussed below, which allow construction work in progress to be included in rate base, thereby improving the timeliness of cash recovery.
The three MISO-approved multi-value projects are primarily being developed by ATXI and are referred to as the Illinois Rivers, Spoon River, and Mark Twain projects. The Illinois Rivers project involves the construction of a 345-kilovolt line from western Indiana across Illinois to eastern Missouri. ATXI has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity and project approvals from the ICC and the MoPSC for each state's portion of the Illinois Rivers project. The last section of this project is expected to be completed in 2019. The Spoon River project is located in northwest Illinois. The Mark Twain project is located in northeast Missouri. In 2015, ATXI obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity and project approval from the ICC for the Spoon River project and construction activities are continuing on schedule. In April 2016, the MoPSC granted ATXI a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Mark Twain project. Before starting construction, ATXI must obtain assents for road crossings from the five counties where the line will be constructed. None of the five county commissions have approved ATXI’s requests for the assents. In October 2016, ATXI filed suit in each of the five county circuit courts to obtain the assents. A decision in each of the five lawsuits is expected in 2017. ATXI plans to complete the Spoon River project in 2018 and the Mark Twain project in 2019; however, further delays in obtaining the consents could delay the completion date of the Mark Twain project. ATXI's total investment in the three projects is expected to be more than $1.6 billion. 
For additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren 


Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, including the FERC complaint case challenging the allowed return on common equity for MISO transmission owners, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
General Regulatory Matters
Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities. 
Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk power electric system. These standards are developed and enforced by NERC pursuant to authority delegated to it by the FERC. If Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, or ATXI are determined not to be in compliance with any of these mandatory reliability standards, they could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.
Under PUHCA 2005, the FERC and any state public utility regulatory agency may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.
Operation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center is subject to regulation by the NRC. The license for the Callaway energy center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center and Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for the Osage hydroelectric energy center expires in 2047. The license for the Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk energy center and its dam in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.
For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Environmental Matters


9

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes and regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment. These environmental statutes and regulations include requirements relating to identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials; safety and health standards; and environmental protection requirements, including standards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants and the management of waste and byproduct materials. Failure to comply with these statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subject to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies, or we could be ordered by the courts to pay private parties. Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and regulations that currently apply to our operations.
The EPA has promulgated environmental regulations that have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. Over time, compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. As of December 31, 2016, Ameren Missouri’s fossil-fueled energy centers represented 18% and 34% of Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s rate base, respectively. Regulations impacting the electric utility industry include the regulation of CO2 emissions from existing power plants through the Clean Power Plan and from new power plants through the revised NSPS; the CSAPR, which requires further reductions of SO2 emissions and NOx emissions from power plants; a regulation governing management and storage of CCR; the MATS, which requires reduction of emissions of mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases from power plants; revised NSPS for particulate matter, SO2, and NOx emissions from new sources; effluent standards applicable to wastewater discharges from power plants; and regulations under the Clean Water Act that could require significant capital expenditures, such as modifications to water intake structures at Ameren Missouri’s energy centers. The EPA also periodically reviews and revises national ambient air quality standards, including those standards associated with emissions from power plants, such as particulate matter, ozone, SO2 and NOx. Certain of these regulations are being or are likely to be challenged through litigation, so their ultimate implementation, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. Although many details of future regulations are unknown, the individual or combined effects of recent environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures and increased operating costs for Ameren and Ameren Missouri. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive, result in the closure or alteration of the operation of some of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers, or require further capital investment. Ameren and Ameren Missouri expect that these costs would be recoverable through rates, subject to MoPSC prudence review, but the nature and timing of costs and their recovery could result in regulatory lag. These environmental regulations could also affect the availability of, the cost of, and the demand for power and natural gas that is acquired for Ameren Missouri's natural gas customers and Ameren Illinois' electric and natural gas customers.


For additional discussion of environmental matters, including NOx and SO2 emission reduction requirements, reductions to CO2 emissions, wastewater discharge standards, remediation efforts, CCR management regulations, and a discussion of the EPA’s allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri's Rush Island energy center, see Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
TRANSMISSION
Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that is composed of the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also operates two balancing authority areas: AMMO and AMIL. During 2016, the peak demand was 7,681 megawatts in AMMO and 8,868 megawatts in AMIL. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.
Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are transmission-owning members of MISO. Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in MISO through May 2018. In 2017, Ameren Missouri expects to file a study required by MoPSC, as it has done periodically since it joined MISO, that evaluates the costs and benefits of Ameren Missouri's continued participation in MISO beyond May 2018.
Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are members of the SERC. The SERC is responsible for ensuring the reliable operation of the bulk electric power system in all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states. Owners and operators, including the Ameren Companies, of the bulk electric power system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and its regional entities, such as the SERC, which are all enforced by the FERC. 
SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER
Ameren Missouri
Ameren Missouri’s electric supply is primarily generated from its energy centers. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy portfolio requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, the availability of power at a cost lower than its generation cost, and absence of sufficient owned generation.
Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new generating capacity. The potential need for new energy center construction is dependent on several key factors, including continuation of, and customer participation in, energy efficiency programs and distributed generation, load growth, technological advancements, costs of generation alternatives, environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants, and state renewable portfolio standards, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets or alterations in the manner in which those assets operate. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload energy center, 


10

Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives and to take steps to preserve options to meet future demand. Steps include evaluating the potential for additional customer energy efficiency programs and options for renewable energy generation, and maintaining options for natural-gas-fired generation to further diversify Ameren Missouri's generation portfolio. 
Ameren Missouri files a nonbinding integrated resource plan with the MoPSC every three years and will file its next plan in 2017. Ameren Missouri's integrated resource plan filed with the MoPSC in October 2014, prior to the issuance of the Clean Power Plan, was a 20-year plan that supported a more diverse energy portfolio in Missouri, including coal, solar, wind, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear power. The plan involves expanding renewable generation, retiring coal-fired generation as those energy centers reach the end of their useful lives, expanding customer energy efficiency programs, and adding natural-gas-fired combined cycle generation. 
See also Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
Ameren Illinois
In Illinois, electric transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, but power supply prices are not regulated. Although electric customers are allowed to purchase power from an alternative retail electric supplier, Ameren Illinois is required to serve as the provider of last resort for its electric distribution customers. In 2016, Ameren Illinois supplied power for 23% of its kilowatthour sales. Power purchased by Ameren Illinois for its electric distribution customers who do not elect to purchase their power from an alternative retail electric supplier comes either through procurement processes conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by MISO. The IPA administers an RFP process through which Ameren Illinois procures its expected supply obligation. The power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its electric distribution customers through a cost recovery mechanism and are reflected in the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's results of operations, but do not affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's earnings as any cost is offset by a corresponding revenue. Ameren Illinois charges transmission and distribution service rates to electric distribution customers who purchase electricity from alternative retail electric suppliers, which does affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution's earnings.
See Note 14 – Related Party Transactions and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on power procurement in Illinois. 
POWER GENERATION
Ameren Missouri owns energy centers that rely on a diverse fuel portfolio, including coal (Ameren Missouri's primary fuel source), nuclear, and natural gas, as well as renewable sources of generation, which include hydroelectric, methane gas, and 


solar. All of Ameren Missouri's coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978. The Callaway nuclear energy center began operation in 1984. As of December 31, 2016, Ameren Missouri's fossil-fueled energy centers represented 18% and 34% of Ameren's and Ameren Missouri's rate base, respectively. See Item 2 – Properties under Part I of this report for information regarding Ameren Missouri's electric generation energy centers.
Coal
Ameren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal as fuel for generation, so it pursues a price-hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Ameren Missouri has agreements in place to purchase and transport coal to its energy centers. As of December 31, 2016, Ameren Missouri had price-hedged its expected coal supply and coal transportation requirements for generation in 2017. Ameren Missouri has additional coal supply under contract through 2020. The coal transport agreements that Ameren Missouri has with Union Pacific Railroad and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway are currently set to expire at the end of 2019. Ameren Missouri burned 17 million tons of coal in 2016. 
About 98% of Ameren Missouri’s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Inventories may be adjusted because of generation levels or uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion and maintenance, derailments, and weather. As of December 31, 2016, coal inventories for Ameren Missouri were near targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren Missouri to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.
Nuclear
The production of nuclear fuel involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, the conversion of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium dioxide fuel pellets, and the fabrication into fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway nuclear energy center.
The Callaway energy center requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in May 2016. The next refueling will be in fall 2017.

Natural Gas Supply for Generation
To maintain deliveries to natural-gas-fired energy centers throughout the year, especially during the summer peak demand, Ameren Missouri’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines. Ameren Missouri primarily uses the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation to transport natural gas to energy centers. In addition to physical transactions, Ameren Missouri uses financial instruments, including some in the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural gas.
Ameren Missouri’s natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to its energy centers. This strategy is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage options and by minimizing cost and price risk through various supply and price-hedging agreements that allow access to multiple natural gas pools, supply basins, and storage services. As of December 31, 2016, Ameren Missouri had price-hedged about 21% of its expected natural gas supply requirements for generation in 2017.
Renewable Energy
The states of Illinois and Missouri have enacted laws requiring electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. 
Illinois required renewable energy resources to equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that Ameren Illinois supplied to its eligible retail customers as of June 1, 2008, with that percentage increasing to 13% by June 1, 2017. For the 2016 plan year, Ameren Illinois met its requirement that 11.5% of its total electricity for eligible retail customers be procured from renewable energy resources. Starting June 1, 2017, after a transition period, Ameren Illinois will be required to procure renewable energy resources for all of its electric distribution customers, regardless if Ameren Illinois or an alternative retail electric supplier provides power to customers. This requirement will be satisfied through future IPA procurement events.
The FEJA requires Ameren Illinois to offer distributed generation rebates for all classes of customers, including customers who share common solar facilities through a subscription arrangement. The cost of the rebates will be recorded as a regulatory asset, which will be included in rate base and earn a return based on the utility’s weighted average cost of capital. Customers with distributed generation will also be eligible for net metering provisions, subject to certain customer participation levels. Beginning in 2017, the FEJA decouples electric distribution revenues established in a rate proceeding from actual sales volumes, which ensures that Ameren Illinois’ earnings will not be harmed by a reduction in sales volumes. 
In Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate electricity equal to at least 2% of native load sales from 


renewable sources beginning in 2011, with that percentage increasing to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% annual limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each renewable energy portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. In 2016, Ameren Missouri met its requirement to purchase or generate at least 5% of its native load sales from renewable energy resources. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement into 2018 with its Keokuk energy center, and its Maryland Heights energy center and through a 102-megawatt power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator. The Maryland Heights energy center generates electricity by burning methane gas collected from a landfill. Ameren Missouri is meeting the solar energy requirement by purchasing solar-generated renewable energy credits from customer-installed systems and by generating its own solar energy at the O'Fallon energy center and at its headquarters building. 
Energy Efficiency
Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have implemented energy efficiency programs to educate and help their customers become more efficient users of energy. In Missouri, the MEEIA established a regulatory framework that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs related to MoPSC-approved customer energy efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utility’s financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy efficiency programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy efficiency standards.
From 2013 through 2015, Ameren Missouri invested $134 million in customer energy efficiency programs and realized $174 million of net shared benefits under the MEEIA 2013 performance plan approved in August 2012.
In February 2016, the MoPSC issued an order approving Ameren Missouri's MEEIA 2016 plan, which included a portfolio of customer energy efficiency programs along with a rider to collect the program costs, the throughput disincentive, and any performance incentive earned from customers. The throughput disincentive recovery will replace the net shared benefits that were collected under the MEEIA 2013 plan. The MEEIA rider will allow Ameren Missouri to collect the throughput disincentive without a traditional rate proceeding, until lower volumes resulting from the MEEIA programs are reflected in base rates. Customer rates, based upon both forecasted program costs and throughput disincentive, will be reconciled annually to actual results. Ameren Missouri intends to invest $158 million in MEEIA 2016 customer energy efficiency programs. In addition, similar to the MEEIA 2013 plan that ended in December 2015, the MoPSC's order approved a performance incentive that would provide Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn additional revenues by achieving certain MEEIA 2016 customer energy efficiency goals, including $27 million if 100% of the goals are achieved during the three-year period. Ameren Missouri can earn more if its energy savings exceed those goals. Ameren Missouri must achieve at least 25% 


12

of its energy efficiency goals before it earns a MEEIA 2016 performance incentive. 
State law requires Ameren Illinois to offer customer energy efficiency programs. The ICC has issued orders approving Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas energy efficiency plans, as well as mechanisms by which program costs can be recovered from customers. For the 12-month period ending May 31, 2016, the ICC authorized electric and natural gas energy efficiency program expenditures of $87 million and $16 million, respectively. Additionally, as part of its IEIMA capital project investments, Ameren Illinois expects to invest $438 million in smart-grid infrastructure from 2012 to 2021, including smart meters that enable customers to improve their energy efficiency. 
Historically, Ameren Illinois has recovered the cost of its energy efficiency programs as they were incurred. Beginning as early as June 2017, the FEJA will allow Ameren Illinois to earn a return on its electric energy efficiency program investments. Ameren Illinois electric energy efficiency investments will be deferred as a regulatory asset and will earn a return at the company’s weighted average cost of capital, with the equity return based on the monthly average yield of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The equity portion of Ameren Illinois’ return on electric energy efficiency investments can also be increased or decreased by 200 basis points based on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. The FEJA increased the level of electric energy efficiency saving targets through 2030. Based on a formula provided in the act, Ameren Illinois estimates it can annually invest up to $100 million from 2018 through 2021, up to $107 million annually from 2022 through 2025, and up to $114 million annually from 2026 through 2030. The ICC has the ability to lower the electric energy efficiency saving goals if there are insufficient cost effective measures available. The electric energy efficiency program investments and the return on those investments will be recovered through a rider, and will not be included in the IEIMA formula rate process. 
NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION
Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each develop and manage a portfolio of natural gas supply resources. These resources include firm natural gas supply under term agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation capacity, firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain natural gas deliveries to customers throughout the year, and especially during peak demand periods. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois primarily use Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, Northern Border Pipeline Company, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to transactions requiring physical delivery, certain financial instruments, including those entered into in the NYMEX futures market and in the OTC financial markets, are 


used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Natural gas purchase costs are passed on to customers of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under PGA clauses, subject to prudence reviews by the MoPSC and the ICC. As of December 31, 2016, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois had price-hedged 73% and 77%, respectively, of their expected 2017 natural gas supply requirements.

INDUSTRY ISSUES
We are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry. These issues include:

• | political, regulatory, and customer resistance to higher rates;


• | the potential for changes in laws, regulations, enforcement efforts, and policies at the state and federal levels;


• | potential changes to corporate income tax law including any federal income tax reform;


• | cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of energy centers and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems and/or loss of data, such as utility customer data and account information;


• | the potential for more intense competition in generation, supply, and distribution, including new technologies and their declining costs;


• | net metering rules and other changes in existing regulatory frameworks and recovery mechanisms to address the allocation of costs to customers who own generation resources that enable them both to sell power to us and to purchase power from us through the use of our transmission and distribution assets;


• | legislation or programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency and renewable sources of power, such as solar, and the lack of consensus as to who should pay for those programs;


• | pressure on customer growth and usage in light of economic conditions and energy efficiency initiatives;


• | changes in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and state laws, including the formation and growth of independent transmission entities;


• | a further expected reduction in the allowed return on common equity on FERC-regulated electric transmission assets;


• | the availability of fuel and fluctuations in fuel prices;


• | the availability of a skilled workforce, including retaining the specialized skills of those who are nearing retirement;


• | regulatory lag;


• | the influence of macroeconomic factors, such as yields on United States Treasury securities and allowed rates of return

13

on equity provided by regulators;

• | higher levels of infrastructure investments that are expected to result in negative or decreased free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities and dividends paid;


• | public concerns about the siting of new facilities;


• | complex new and proposed environmental laws, regulations, and requirements, including air and water quality standards, mercury emissions standards, CCR management requirements, and CO2 limitations, which may reduce the frequency at which electric generating units are dispatched based upon their CO2 emissions;


• | public concerns about the potential environmental impacts from the combustion of fossil fuels and some investors' concerns about investing in energy companies that have fossil-fueled generation assets;


• | aging infrastructure and the need to construct new power


generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, which have long time frames for completion, with limited long-term ability to predict power and commodity prices and regulatory requirements;

• | public concerns about nuclear generation, decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste; and


• | consolidation of electric and natural gas utility companies.

We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in this report, we are unable to predict what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
