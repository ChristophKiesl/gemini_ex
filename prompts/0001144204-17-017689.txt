Introduction
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all of the indium from our stockpile. As a result, we are no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. We have begun evaluating strategic options including the acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company. In connection therewith, we have engaged Brack Advisors LLC (Brack), a company owned by Richard A. Biele, one of our directors, to assist in identifying, evaluating and negotiating strategic transactions. We paid Brack $50 thousand in 2016 under a consulting agreement with Brack (the Brack Agreement) and agreed to pay $25 thousand in 2017 under the Brack Agreement, as amended (Amended Brack Agreement). However, there can be no assurance that we will enter into any such transaction, and if so, on terms favorable to us.
 
In December 2015, our Board approved a cash distribution to stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per share of common stock (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution was classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid-in capital for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2015, our board of directors (Board) approved a program to repurchase up to $650 thousand in shares of our common stock. In connection therewith, we repurchased 139,070 shares of our common stock in September 2015 for approximately $0.2 million, or $1.40 per share. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, 1,744,569 shares of our common stock were outstanding.
 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our annual cash operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $0.3 million while we review our strategic options. We believe that we have sufficient funds to sustain operations until at least March 31, 2018.
 
 In 2015, management services were provided under an agreement (2015 Nano Agreement) with Nano-Cap Advisors LLC (Nano) in which Ailon Z. Grushkin, Chairman of our Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole shareholder. Under the arrangement, which was approved by our Board, we paid Nano $90 thousand in 2015 to provide management services and office space. During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement (2016 Nano Agreement) with Nano under which Nano continued to provide such services in 2016 for a fee of $70 thousand. We have agreed to pay Nano $35 thousand in 2017 under the 2016 Nano Agreement, as amended (Amended 2016 Nano Agreement).
 
We are not legally prohibited from pursuing other business strategies pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or any other corporate document. We will promptly notify stockholders of any modifications to our stated business plan. Our operations have been limited to purchasing, stockpiling, lending or leasing the metal indium. Prior to December 31, 2014, we sold our entire indium stockpile. We have begun evaluating strategic options including the merger or acquisition of a new line of business or the sale or full liquidation of the Company, which would require approval of our Board and will require stockholder approval.
 
Employees
 
We have no full-time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer and President provides services to us on a part time basis under an agreement with Nano. Our Chief Financial Officer is a part-time employee and our administrative assistant is a part-time independent contractor.
