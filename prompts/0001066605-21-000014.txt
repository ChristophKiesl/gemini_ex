ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. (“Heidrick & Struggles”) is a leadership advisory firm providing executive search and consulting services to businesses and business leaders worldwide. When we use the terms “Heidrick & Struggles,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” in this Form 10-K, we mean Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. We provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 425 consultants located in major cities around the world. Heidrick & Struggles and its predecessors have been a leadership advisor for more than 60 years. Heidrick & Struggles was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1999 when two of our predecessors merged to form Heidrick & Struggles.
Our service offerings include the following:
Executive Search. We partner with respected organizations globally to build and sustain the best leadership teams in the world, with a specialized focus on the placement of top-level senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level senior executives provides the opportunity for several competitive advantages including access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search and consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint. Working at the top of client organizations also facilitates the attraction and retention of high-caliber consultants who desire to serve top industry executives and their leadership needs. Our executive search services derive revenue through the fees generated for each search engagement, which generally are based on the annual compensation for the placed executive. We provide our executive search services primarily on a retained basis, recruiting senior executives whose first-year base salary and bonus averaged approximately $370,000 in 2020 on a worldwide basis.
The executive search industry is highly fragmented, consisting of several thousand executive search firms worldwide. Executive search firms are generally separated into two broad categories: retained search and contingency search. Retained executive search firms fulfill their clients’ senior leadership needs by identifying potentially qualified candidates and assisting clients in evaluating and assessing these candidates. Retained executive search firms generally are compensated for their services regardless of whether the client employs a candidate identified by the search firm and are generally retained on an exclusive basis. Typically, retained executive search firms are paid a retainer for their services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, executive search firms often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. In contrast, contingency search firms are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate.
We are a retained executive search firm. Our search process typically consists of the following steps:

•Analyzing the client’s business needs in order to understand its organizational structure, relationships and culture, advising the client as to the required set of skills and experiences for the position, and identifying with the client the other characteristics desired of the successful candidate;
•Selecting, contacting, interviewing and evaluating candidates on the basis of experience and potential cultural fit with the client organization;
•Presenting confidential written reports on the candidates who potentially fit the position specification;
•Scheduling a mutually convenient meeting between the client and each candidate;
•Completing reference checks on the final candidate selected by the client; and
•Assisting the client in structuring compensation packages and supporting the successful candidate’s integration into the client team.
Heidrick Consulting. In 2018, we combined our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses to create Heidrick Consulting, a comprehensive offering of the firm's leadership advisory services. Our consulting services include leadership assessment and development, executive coaching and on-boarding, succession planning, team and board effectiveness, organizational performance acceleration, workforce planning and culture shaping. Our consulting services generate revenue 
primarily through the professional fees generated for each engagement which are generally based on the size of the project and scope of services. Heidrick Consulting represented less than 10% of our net revenue in 2020.
Organization
Our organizational structure, which is arranged by geography, service offering and industry and functional practices, is designed to enable us to better understand our clients’ cultures, operations, business strategies, industries and regional markets for leadership talent.
Geographic Structure. We provide senior-level executive search and consulting services to our clients worldwide through a network of 51 offices in 28 countries including our affiliates. Each office size varies; however, major locations are staffed with consultants, research associates, administrative assistants and other support staff. Administrative functions are centralized where possible, although certain support and research functions are situated regionally because of variations in local requirements. We face risks associated with political instability, legal requirements and currency fluctuations in our international operations. Examples of such risks include difficulties in managing global operations, social and political instability, regulations and potential adverse tax consequences. For a more complete description of the risks associated with our business see the Section in this Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors”.
In addition to our wholly owned subsidiaries, our worldwide network includes affiliate relationships in Finland, South Africa and Turkey. We have no financial investment in these affiliates but receive licensing fees from them for the use of our name and our databases. Licensing fees are less than 1% of our net revenue.
Information by Geography. We operate our Executive Search services in three geographic regions, each of which is reported as a separate reporting segment: the Americas (which includes the countries in North and South America); Europe (which includes the continents of Europe and Africa); and Asia Pacific (which includes Asia and the region generally known as the Middle East). Our Heidrick Consulting reporting segment operates globally.
Americas Executive Search. As of December 31, 2020, we had 190 consultants in our Americas segment. The largest offices in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are located in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.
Europe Executive Search. As of December 31, 2020, we had 102 consultants in our Europe segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.
Asia Pacific Executive Search. As of December 31, 2020, we had 69 consultants in our Asia Pacific segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Japan.
Heidrick Consulting. As of December 31, 2020, we had 65 consultants in our Heidrick Consulting segment. The largest countries in this segment, as defined by net revenue, are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Dubai.
The relative percentages of net revenue attributable to each segment were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Executive Search | | | | | 
Americas | 58 | % | | 58 | % | 57 | %
Europe | 20 | % | | 19 | % | 20 | %
Asia Pacific | 13 | % | | 14 | % | 14 | %
Heidrick Consulting | 9 | % | | 9 | % | 9 | %

For financial information relating to each segment, see Note 17, Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Global Industry Practices. Our executive search and consulting businesses operate in six broad industry groups listed below. These industry categories and their relative sizes, as measured by billings for 2020, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:

 | Percentage of Billings
Global Industry Practices | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Financial Services | 25 | % | | 26 | % | 28 | %
Global Technology & Services | 21 | | | 21 | | 20 | 
Industrial | 20 | | | 21 | | 21 | 
Consumer Markets | 17 | | | 17 | | 16 | 
Healthcare & Life Sciences | 14 | | | 12 | | 11 | 
Social Impact | 3 | | | 3 | | 4 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Within each broad industry group are a number of industry sub-sectors. Consultants often specialize in one or more sub-sectors to provide clients with market intelligence and candidate knowledge specific to their industry. For example, within the Financial Services sector, our business is diversified amongst a number of industry sub-sectors including Asset & Wealth Management, Consumer & Commercial Finance, Commodities, Corporate and Transaction Banking, Global Markets, Hedge Fund, Infrastructure, Investment Banking, Insurance, Private Equity Investment Professionals and Real Estate.
We service our clients with global industry interests and needs through unified global executive search teams who specialize in industry practices. This go-to-market strategy allows us to leverage our global diversity and market intelligence and is designed to provide better client service. Each client is served by one global account team, which we believe is a key differentiator from our competition.
Global Functional Practices. Our Executive Search consultants also specialize in searches for specific “C-level” functional positions, which are roles that generally report directly to the chief executive officer.
Our Global Functional Practices include Chief Executive Officer & Board of Directors; Human Resources Officers, Financial Officers; Information and Technology Officers, Legal, Risk, Compliance & Government Affairs, Marketing, Sales and Strategy Officers and Supply Chain and Operations.
Our team of Executive Search consultants may service clients from any one of our offices around the world. For example, an executive search for a chief financial officer of an industrial company located in the United Kingdom may involve an executive search consultant in the United Kingdom with an existing relationship with the client, another executive search consultant in the United States with expertise in our Industrial practice and a third executive search consultant with expertise in recruiting chief financial officers. This same industrial client may also engage us to perform skill-based assessments for each of its senior managers, which could require the expertise of one of our leadership advisory consultants trained in this service.
Client Base
For many of our clients, our global access to and knowledge of regional and functional markets and candidate talent is an important differentiator of our business. Our clients generally fall into one of the following categories:

•Fortune 1000 companies;
•Major U.S. and non-U.S. companies;
•Middle market and emerging growth companies;
•Governmental, higher education and not-for-profit organizations; and
•Other leading private and public entities.
Clients and Marketing
Our consultants market the firm’s executive search and consulting services through two principal means: targeted client calling and industry networking with clients and referral sources. These efforts are supported by proprietary databases, which provide our consultants with information as to contacts made by their colleagues with particular referral sources, candidates and 
clients. In addition, we benefit from a significant number of referrals generated by our reputation for high quality service and successfully completed assignments, as well as repeat business resulting from our ongoing client relationships.
In support of client calling and networking, the practice teams as well as individual consultants also author and publish articles and white papers on a variety of leadership and talent topics and trends around the world. Our consultants often present research findings and talent insights at notable conferences and events as well. Our insights are sometimes acknowledged by major media outlets and trade journalists. These efforts aid in the marketing of our services as well.
Either by agreement with the clients or to maintain strong client relationships, we may refrain from recruiting employees of a client, or possibly other entities affiliated with that client, for a specified period of time but typically not more than one year from the commencement of a search. We seek to mitigate any adverse effects of these off-limits arrangements by strengthening our long-term relationships, allowing us to communicate our belief to prospective clients that we can conduct searches effectively notwithstanding certain off-limits arrangements.
No single client accounted for more than 1% of our net revenue in 2020, and no more than 2% in 2019 or 2018. As a percentage of total revenue, our top ten clients in aggregate accounted for approximately 6% in 2020, 7% in 2019, and 6% in 2018.
Information Management Systems
We rely on technology to support our consultants and staff in the search process. We employ a global approach to executive search built on better insights, more data and faster decision making facilitated by the use of our proprietary Infinity Framework and Heidrick Connect. Our Infinity Framework allows clients to holistically evaluate a candidate's pivotal experience and expertise, leadership capabilities, agility and potential, and culture fit and impact, thereby allowing our clients to find the right person for the role. We supplement our Infinity Framework through a series of additional online tools including our Leadership Accelerator, Leadership Signature and Culture Signature assessments. Heidrick Connect, a completely digital, always available, client experience portal allows our clients to access talent insights for each engagement, including the Infinity Framework and other proprietary assessment tools. In response to working remotely, our Executive Search teams employed Heidrick Connect to operate effectively and efficiently while engaging virtually with our clients. Additionally, we have introduced upgrades to Heidrick Connect, resulting in greater flexibility, increased productivity and the ability to deliver more insights to our clients. 
Our consulting business’ proprietary Web-based system, Culture Connect, is integral to the culture-shaping process. This technology platform enables our consultants to administer, analyze and interpret online Corporate Culture Profiles™ surveys to develop clarity around team and organizational need and desired outcomes. In addition, we gather data using our online Culture Impact Survey™ to determine which culture-shaping concepts are being utilized by individuals and the team as a whole. Our Heidrick Consulting teams have pivoted to create new digital solutions for Leadership Assessments, Team Acceleration, and Organization and Culture Acceleration that can be delivered virtually in response to required social distancing practices.
Competition
The executive search industry is highly competitive. While we face competition to some degree from all firms in the industry, we believe our most direct competition comes from four established global retained executive search firms that conduct searches primarily for the most senior-level positions within an organization. In particular, our competitors include Egon Zehnder International, Korn Ferry, Russell Reynolds Associates, and Spencer Stuart. To a lesser extent, we also face competition from smaller boutique firms that specialize in certain regional markets or industry segments and Internet-based firms. Each firm with which we compete is also a competitor in the marketplace for effective search consultants.
Overall, the search industry has relatively few barriers to entry; however, there are higher barriers to entry to compete with global retained executive search firms that can provide leadership consulting services at the senior executive level. At this level, clients rely more heavily on a search firm’s reputation, global access and the experience level of its consultants. We believe that the segment of executive search in which we compete is more quality-sensitive than price-sensitive. As a result, we compete on the level of service we offer, reflected by our client services specialties and, ultimately, by the quality of our search results. We believe that our emphasis on senior-level executive search, the depth of experience of our search consultants and our global presence enable us to compete favorably with other executive search firms.
Competition in the leadership consulting markets in which we operate is highly fragmented, with no universally recognized market leaders.
Seasonality
There is no discernible seasonality in our business, although as a percentage of total annual net revenue, the first quarter typically generates less revenue than the other three quarters. Revenue and operating income have historically varied by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter. In addition, the volatility in the global economy and business cycles can impact our quarterly revenue and operating income.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Summary. As of December 31, 2020, Heidrick & Struggles employed 1,563 employees, which includes 856 in the Americas, 442 in Europe, and 265 in Asia Pacific. Our headcount included of 426 consultants (361 related to Executive Search and 65 related to Heidrick Consulting), 480 associates and 657 other search, support and Global Operations Support staff.
Within Executive Search and Heidrick Consulting, our professionals are generally categorized either as consultants or associates. Associates assist consultants by providing research support, coordinating candidate contact and performing other engagement-related functions. We promote our associates to consultants during the annual consultant promotion process, and we recruit our consultants from other executive search or human capital firms, or in the case of executive search, consultants new to search who have worked in industries or functions represented by our practices. In the latter case, these are often seasoned executives with extensive contacts and outstanding reputations who are entering the search profession as a second career and whom we train in our techniques and methodologies. Our Heidrick Consulting consultants are recruited for their executive business experience as well as their skills in consulting and leadership advisory and often are former clients who are familiar with our consulting methodology. We are not a party to any U.S.-based collective bargaining agreement, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Our Values. We believe that our success is grounded in how we operate each and every day as individual professionals and, collectively, as a firm. In 2015, we formalized our long-held beliefs into defined values to guide our employees – Grow with our clients; Win as one firm; Always act with Integrity; and Own the results. These values still represent who we are and who we want to be. With the unique circumstances brought on by the pandemic and the renewed urgency to address racial inequality, over the last year we reflected further on how our employees, our connections with one another, and the communities we build together shape our identity and aspirations as a firm. Importantly, we saw an opportunity to directly underscore the importance of our employees in our values.
With this in mind, we have introduced an additional, important new value – Respect and value each individual – to more clearly articulate our commitment to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive environment, one where all individual voices and backgrounds are welcomed, listened to and valued. Our values serve to guide us in how we approach our business and how we treat our colleagues and clients, and also help us build trust and a common understanding of what we stand for and believe in as a firm. 
In 2020, we demonstrated the strength of our culture and the positive results we could achieve as we worked together to drive our transformation in the midst of an unprecedented year. We strive to build on these efforts as we continue to grow our business with our new, expanded and explicitly more inclusive values. 
Diversity and Inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is imperative for our internal culture, as we believe it drives innovation and future growth. We have committed substantial time and resources to advance diversity in our workforce, and we continue to support a culture where diversity is celebrated. We also work to create a culture of inclusion, where everyone feels valued and supported, and is encouraged to contribute to our success through authentic participation. Collaboration and inclusion are among our greatest strengths. By cultivating a culture that brings the maximum range of ideas and experience to our work with clients around the world, we believe we increase our innovation, create better solutions to our clients’ business challenges and win as one firm.
Our diversity and inclusion efforts are comprised of many initiatives including:
•Creating an Advancing Black Leaders Action Group.
•Commitment to the “Paradigm for Parity”, a movement that is a coalition of business leaders dedicated to addressing the leadership gender gap in corporate America. We created and launched the Accelerating Women’s Excellence initiative to develop high-potential women for promotion into leadership positions. In 2021, we launched the third cohort of this program. 
•Holding “Courageous Conversations” around race and intersectionality.
•Development and signing of the Association of Executive Search Consultants Diversity Pledge.
•Establishing employee resource groups including: Women’s Inclusion Network, Professionals of Color, Ethnic Diversity Engagement Network, Pride@Heidrick, and Honor Equality and Inclusion for Disability
•Diverse office, practice and executive leaders within the firm.
In 2020, we reaffirmed our commitment to diversity and inclusion with the appointment of our Chief Inclusion Officer and the establishment of our diversity and inclusion aspirations - “We Create, We Invest, We Build.” These aspirations are explained below:
•We create a culture of inclusion where everyone is valued and respected. We create a culture that embraces differences and encourages authenticity. We create innovation by maximizing the contributions of our diverse populations. We offer services to our clients to help them do the same.
•We invest in the advancement, experience and success of diverse talent within our organization. We invest in leaders both internally and externally who are inclusive and empathetic and champion diversity. We invest in our communities, specifically targeting those groups who have been historically underrepresented and disadvantaged.
•We build talent pipelines for our clients and ourselves that intentionally target and develop diverse talent. We build diverse and inclusive teams to best represent our clients and their interests. We build innovative solutions to enhance the success of diverse individuals. We build quantifiable measures that define and track diversity statistics to create accountability.
We believe that diversity and inclusion are key elements of an organization’s ability to mobilize, execute and transform with agility.
Employee Engagement. We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback through our proprietary Organization Accelerator Questionnaire (“OAQ”) every two years. The OAQ provides an accurate Acceleration Profile based on assessment of the 13 Drive Factors of organizational performance. The OAQ captures an individual’s perception of the organization, as well as their own personal experience within the organization, and tracks progress from period to period, while also benchmarking teams within the same organization. The insights it provides enable focused action planning. Results of the questionnaire are measured, analyzed and discussed in live sessions in each office to enhance the employee experience, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization. On a global basis, 92% of our employees participated in the OAQ in 2020.
Learning and Development. We are committed to the professional development of our employees and promoting a continuous learning culture within our firm. Our learning and development programs have been created with the goal of building leadership, business development, account management, client service, and change leadership skills among our employees. In addition to building personal and professional capabilities, these programs set a standard for the behaviors that will help us realize our business goals and strategies.
In 2020, our Learning & Development team re-imagined our programs to adapt to a virtual environment, and we will continue to deliver programs virtually in 2021. Our learning catalog outlines dozens of live, virtual programs and thousands of eLearning courses designed to help build and enhance employee leadership, business acumen and business development skills. These programs are continually updated to reflect best practices and feedback received from employees. 
Over 1,200 of our employees participated in almost 11,000 hours of virtual learning during 2020.
Participation in our Communities. We are proud members and eager participants in communities where we work. We know first-hand from our client work the positive eﬀects that strong leaders can bring to both organizations and communities, and to encourage employees to contribute to our communities as well. 
The Company formed a Global Philanthropic Committee in 2019 to establish a coordinated, global approach to supporting the charitable causes and philanthropic endeavors that impact our employees, clients and communities. We also respect the right 
of our employees to independently engage in charitable causes and encourage the same. We collaborate to find appropriate charitable and community causes by promoting suggestions to the Global Philanthropic Committee. 
In 2019, employees participated in our first ever Global Day of Service where we, as a firm, gave back to our communities by raising awareness, volunteering and raising funds for non-profits and organizations focused on education, training, development and other local causes. In 2020, participation in the Global Day of Service increased to over 600 employees in 26 offices benefiting over 45 organizations and non-profits.
Compensation and Benefits. Our goal is not only to challenge our employees to reach their potential professionally, and reward them for great work, but also to understand and consider their need to be simultaneously healthy, balanced and focused. We believe in fair compensation, based upon demonstrated capabilities and achievement, experience, and superior performance. We place great importance on incentivizing, recognizing, and rewarding performance and behaviors aligned with our values in the form of discretionary bonus awards. Through our benefits program, we demonstrate commitment to fostering an environment in which employees are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and in which the best talent wants to work and thrive. Our benefits are administered on a country-by-country basis, so that benefits are comparable to other employers within each jurisdiction and our industry. We use several measures to ensure that our benefits offerings are up-to-date, competitive in the marketplace, and in line with employee needs, including employee surveys, benchmarking exercises, and other benefits measurement tools. Benefits offered to our employees may include annual leave and other paid time off, medical, dental and vision benefits, prescription drug benefits, flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs, 401(k) and deferred compensation retirement programs, short and long-term disability insurance, critical illness insurance and life insurance.
Employee Safety. As we continue to navigate through these extraordinary times, our top priority has been ensuring the health and safety of our employees, clients and the communities where we live and work around the globe. To minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and in line with guidance and mandates from local and national governments and health authorities, we have suspended all business travel and instituted a work-from-home policy across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. As a digital-focused, tech-enabled firm, we have been able to adapt quickly to having so many of our employees work from home, and have also expanded the support provided to our employees and their families, including flexible work times and telemedicine options. In addition, we have been reviewing our business continuity plans on an ongoing basis to ensure our operations continue to run smoothly.
Ethics. Employees are encouraged to speak to their colleagues and representatives in Legal and Human Resources whenever an ethical question or situation arises. We also have established the Heidrick & Struggles EthicsLine, a service that provides a mechanism for reporting alleged breaches of any legal or regulatory obligations, financial fraud, including accounting, internal controls and auditing, or any alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or corporate policies to the Company. The EthicsLine is a web-based and telephonic reporting hotline available to all company employees, contractors, vendors, stockholders, clients, or other interested parties. The EthicsLine is administered by an independent third party that is separate from the Company and specializes in running whistleblower hotline programs for companies throughout the U.S. Calls are not recorded and callers may remain anonymous. The EthicsLine is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To contact the EthicsLine, you may dial 800-735-0589 toll-free in the U.S. or 704-731-7242 outside the U.S. or by visiting https://heidrickandstruggles.alertline.com.

In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data.
