ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Vectrus, Inc. (Vectrus, the Company, our company, we, us or our) is a leading provider of services to the United States (U.S.) government worldwide. Leveraging a history of more than 70 years, we provide global service solutions in 143 locations and 18 countries across three continents in both stable and unstable political and economic environments. We have a proven history of deploying resources rapidly and with precision to support the mission success of our customers. 
 We operate our business based on three core values of Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We operate in one segment and offer the following services: facility and logistics services and information technology and network communications services. 
Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) with a high concentration in the U.S. Army. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had total revenue of $1.2 billion, all of which was derived from U.S. government customers. 
We employ approximately 5,600 people and engage approximately 7,000 subcontractor personnel around the world. This includes an experienced management team with an average of 27 years of experience in the military, industry, and a wide range of U.S. government agencies. Our management team has experience winning new contracts, driving premier operating efficiency, and managing all aspects of the demanding compliance culture required to do business with the U.S. government worldwide. We are also a leading employer of veterans with more than 35% of our employees reporting a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer. 
Vectrus was incorporated as an Indiana corporation on February 4, 2014. On September 27, 2014, Exelis Inc. (Exelis) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off) of Vectrus. Prior to the Spin-off, we were a subsidiary of Exelis that constituted Exelis' Mission Systems business, which was part of Exelis' Information and Technical Services segment. As a result of the Spin-off, Vectrus became an independent, publicly traded company. Exelis was acquired by Harris Corporation in May 2015. 
Our Business Strategy 
We recently initiated a strategic process that will leverage the capabilities of our facility and logistics service offerings with our information technology and network communications service offerings. 
Vectrus will drive growth through strategic imperatives aligned to the following three core strategies: Enhance the Foundation, Expand the Portfolio and Add More Value. These strategies will evolve to include more innovative, technology-enabled methods, capabilities and business models. Key components of our core strategies include: 

• | Enhance the Foundation. We will enhance our business by strengthening our existing approaches to deliver high value, high impact services to our clients. We cultivate a global Vectrus Improvement Project (VIP) culture that encourages every Vectrus employee to implement measurable improvements. The VIPs align with our business objectives, benefiting our clients, employees, and overall performance. We support this VIP culture with an internal reward and recognition program and a robust internal training program, equipping our leaders with the tools to sustain our daily approach to continuous improvement. We will expand our VIP program to become an enterprise-wide program and infuse new technologies and enhanced operational capabilities into our current operations and programs wherever possible.


• | Expand the Portfolio. We are focused on creating a higher-value, technology-enabled and differentiated platform through strengthening our IT competencies and fusing the physical and digital aspects of our client’s facility and logistics missions. We will package our capabilities by leveraging our strong foundation in facilities, logistics and IT. In addition, we will seek to partner with highly innovative third parties. The result will be a more technology-enabled, differentiated and higher value portfolio.


• | Add More Value. The convergence of our clients' physical and digital infrastructure and supply chains represents an opportunity to improve the outcomes of our clients' missions while creating a higher value, growth oriented platform. We are evolving our long-term strategy in order to take advantage of this opportunity and to shape our future. While we are in the early stages of this strategic journey, the essence of these imperatives will be to, with our clients, create more predictive, agile and responsive infrastructures and supply chains to create a significantly differentiated, growth oriented business.

Customers
We attribute the strength of our relationship with the DoD and other branches of the U.S. government to our focus on program performance, global responsiveness and operational excellence, as well as our core values of Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We treat sales to our U.S. government customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. Our revenue from the U.S. government for the periods presented below was as follows: 
 | Year Ending December 31,
(In thousands) | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014

Competition 
Our competition varies depending on our service offerings. In facility and logistics services, our primary competitors are PAE Facilities Management (PAE), Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. (DynCorp), KBR Inc., Fluor Corporation and AECOM. Our principal competitors in information technology and network communications services include divisions of Leidos, Harris Corporation (which acquired Exelis in May 2015), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), CSRA, Inc. and General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT). 
The U.S. government has implemented policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. Certain U.S. government work in the U.S. has been restricted to small businesses, including Alaska native companies, from time to time. We participate with these small businesses as a subcontractor for select opportunities, as appropriate. In addition, we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services will help us to win and perform the contract. Our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs. 
Competitive bids for the work that Vectrus pursues are based on technical qualifications and corporate experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope, and are highly price sensitive. While not every contract is procured via selection of the lowest priced bidder, customers are sensitive to cost based on their budget allocations. Acquisition cycles are long (generally 12 to 24 months), and contracts are typically multi-year contracts that include an initial period of one year or less with annual one year (or less) option periods for the remaining contract period. 
Some U.S. government customers have shown a strong preference for multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These contracts offer awards to a pool of contractors, followed by competition within the pool for individual programs via task orders under each IDIQ over the period of performance. Period of performance under IDIQ contracts follows a traditional three-to-ten-year performance cycle. The governing IDIQ contracts often have multi-billion dollar ceiling values. 
There are typically fewer competitors in the overseas market for each of our services capabilities. We believe that a primary strength of our company is our expeditionary nature that is grounded in our ability to recruit U.S. and international personnel with appropriate expertise, as well as navigate the logistical, legal, and other challenges of operating in multiple, challenging overseas locations.
Our company closely monitors costs to foster highly competitive pricing and uses an in-house business development model both to manage the cost of revenue and capture opportunities for future bids. 
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of awards, product deliveries, customer acceptance of products and services, contract phase-in durations, contract completions, and the availability of customer funding. 
Regulatory Environment
The U.S. government markets in which we serve are highly regulated. We market our services to the DoD and equivalent foreign agencies, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and intelligence and other civilian agencies. When working with U.S. agencies and entities, we comply with laws and regulations relating to the creation, administration and performance of contracts. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 
8


• | Require compliance with government standards for contract administration, accounting and management internal control systems;


• | Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced U.S. government contracts;


• | Require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;


• | Require us not to compete for, or to divest ourselves of, work if an organizational conflict of interest exists related to such work that cannot be appropriately mitigated; and


• | Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.

U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various rules regarding procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, allowable costs, contract performance, contract termination and adjustment, audits, and IT system security and privacy controls. In addition, as government contractors, we are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance, cost structure, incurred costs, forward pricing rates and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards under our contracts. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, and related business systems. 
The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new or revised contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance training relevant to their respective positions. 
We are subject to other U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the False Claims Act. When working overseas, we must comply not only with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, but also with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. laws, including regulations relating to import-export control, foreign tax considerations, foreign labor and environmental law, and anti-corruption. 
Contracts
U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts to a prime contractor, which may utilize one or more subcontractors. We were the prime contractor on contracts representing 95%, 90% and 86% of our revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Our company usually is a prime contractor on long-term contracts that are of a finite duration of between three and ten years. The U.S. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or if they change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract price for additions to or reductions in scope or other changes that it directs. 
Generally, the sales price elements for our contracts are cost-plus, cost-reimbursable or firm-fixed-price. We commonly have elements of cost-plus, cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed price contracts on a single contract. 
On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement, up to funding levels predetermined by our customers. On cost-plus type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts. Most of our cost-plus contracts also contain a firm-fixed-price element. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship between total allowable and target cost. 
On most of our contracts, a cost-reimbursable element captures consumable materials required for the program. Typically these costs do not bear fees. 
9

A firm-fixed-price type contract typically offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type contract, which is commensurate with the greater levels of risk we assume on a firm-fixed-price type contract. On a firm-fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined contract price. Although a firm-fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Accounting for revenue on a firm-fixed-price type contract is covered by contract accounting standards, which require the preparation of estimates of (1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract’s statement of work, and (3) the measurement of progress towards completion. Adjustments to original estimates for a firm-fixed-price type contract’s revenue are often required as work progresses under a contract. Although the overall scope of work required under the contract may not change, profit may be adjusted as experience is gained and as efficiencies are realized or costs are incurred.
The percentage of our total revenue generated from each contract type for the periods presented was as follows: 

 | Year Ending December 31,
Contract type | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Cost-Plus and Cost-Reimbursable | 75 | % | | 73 | % | 76 | %
Firm-Fixed-Price | 25 | % | | 27 | % | 24 | %
Total Revenue | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Backlog
Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer) and represents firm orders and potential options on multi-year contracts. Total backlog excludes potential orders under IDIQ contracts. The value of the backlog is based on anticipated revenue levels over the anticipated life of the contract. Actual volumes may be greater or less than anticipated. Total backlog is converted into revenue as work is performed. The level of order activity related to programs can be affected by the timing of government funding authorizations and their project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others.
We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenue within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for convenience. Most of our contracts have terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed in the event of a termination for convenience.
Total backlog decreased by $56.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, total backlog (funded and unfunded) was $2.4 billion. 

 | As of December 31,
(In millions) | 2016 | | 2015
Funded backlog | $ | 665 | | | $ | 685 
Unfunded backlog | 1,691 | | | 1,727 | 
Total backlog | $ | 2,356 | | | $ | 2,412

Funded orders, which are different from funded backlog, represent orders for which funding was received during the period. We received funded orders of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of $118.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the timing of funded orders for some of our contracts. 
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and visitors. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, the nature of which is inherently unpredictable, and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Environmental, health and safety requirements are significant factors affecting all of our operations and we have established a comprehensive program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements. 
10

Employees
Integrity, Respect and Responsibility are our core values. We maintain rigorous compliance and other corporate responsibility programs that are intended to ensure a safe and secure work environment and compliance with government regulations, and allow employees to voice any concerns while knowing that matters raised will be appropriately addressed. Our company employs people of diverse backgrounds and we believe that our diversity enhances our creativity and enriches our work culture. We are committed to good corporate citizenship and intend to always seek to maintain the trust and support of the communities in which our employees work and live. 
As of December 31, 2016, our global workforce was comprised of approximately 5,600 employees and approximately 7,000 subcontracted workers, spanning 143 locations in 18 countries. Approximately 1,800 of our employees are represented under five collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Three of the five collective bargaining agreements are due to be negotiated in 2017. Our Turkey Collective Labor Agreement on our TSBMC contract is presently being negotiated by the U.S. Air Force. This negotiation is now with the Turkish High Arbitration Board and we expect will be concluded during 2017. The TSBMC Spanish labor agreement and the Tariff Agreement on our K-TOWN contract will likely be negotiated during 2017. We believe that relations with our employees are positive.
