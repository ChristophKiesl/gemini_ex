Overview 
 We are a genetic medicines company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for genetically defined diseases. Nucleic acid therapeutics are a growing and innovative class of drugs that have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. We are initially developing oligonucleotides that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins. 
 The nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure. A stereopure oligonucleotide is comprised of molecules with atoms precisely arranged in three-dimensional orientations at each linkage. We believe controlling the position of the sulfur atom following phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification, as described below, will optimize the pharmacological profile of our therapeutics by maximizing therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. The stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others. In nucleic acid therapeutics, the modification of the PS backbone of oligonucleotides is a common alteration, where non-bridging oxygens are replaced with a sulfur atom at each phosphate linkage. Each linkage creates a chiral center that has three-dimensional properties that can either have an “Sp” orientation or an “Rp” orientation. A chiral center is an atom that is bonded to a defined set of pendant groups arranged in a three-dimensional space in a way that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Those chiral configurations are not purposefully designed or controlled, creating mixtures of many thousands of molecules, each having varying three-dimensional atomic arrangements. Such variations may lead to potentially differing pharmacologic properties, with some constituent molecules producing therapeutic effects and others being less beneficial or even contributing to undesirable side effects.
 Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior pharmacologic properties as compared to mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. Our platform is designed to enable us to rationally design, optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics, which were previously thought to be too difficult to make and too expensive to manufacture. Through proprietary rational design, we are also able to develop phosphodiester / phosphorothioate (“PO/PS”) modified combinations in our nucleic acids, allowing for judicious and specific use of PS modifications, with the ability to reduce the number of PS in a molecule. We believe this ability to selectively employ PS modification where desired may provide further control over pharmacodynamics and may improve the safety of our drugs. Further, our platform has the potential to design therapies that use any of the major molecular mechanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics, including antisense, ribonucleic acid interference (“RNAi”), splicing, and exon skipping, as described below. 
 Our goal is to develop disease-modifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. We are focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. In addition to our current programs in development, we are also leveraging our platform to explore the next generation of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics that have the potential to selectively target certain cell types. We believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals, because our team is comprised of leaders in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics, including world renowned scientists, leading researchers in the field and executives with a proven track record in drug discovery development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics.

Hepatic | Undisclosed | Pfizer 
Note: Pfizer is entitled to nominate two additional targets by November 2017. 

 Our core focus for our wholly-owned proprietary programs is neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the central nervous system (the “CNS”) and neuromuscular system.  We expect to initiate six development programs by the end of 2018. These programs include our three most advanced programs, which are in Huntington’s disease (“HD”), and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), and three additional development candidates which we expect to select by the end of 2017.  Further details regarding our programs are set forth below. 
  
• | In HD, we have two separate programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, each targeting two disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (“SNPs”), within the huntingtin gene: rs362307 (“HTT SNP-1”) and rs362331 (“HTT SNP-2”). SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing production of a defective protein which causes disease. It has been shown that by targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with HD can be reduced. We expect to initiate clinical development of both WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 in mid-2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In DMD, we have developed WVE-210201, which targets exon 51, a region within the ribonucleic acid, (“RNA”), transcribed from the dystrophin gene. DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that results in dysfunctional dystrophin protein. We expect to initiate clinical development of WVE-210201 in the second half of 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Pfizer focused on the advancement of genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, bringing together our proprietary drug development platform, across antisense and single-stranded RNAi modalities, along with GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver. The collaboration seeks to leverage our stereochemistry platform across antisense and RNAi modalities and incorporates GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will select, and we will advance, up to five targets from discovery through to the selection of clinical candidates, at which point Pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization. Two targets were declared upon initiation of the agreement, including Apolipoprotein C-III. In the third quarter of 2016, Pfizer nominated its third target. Per the terms of the agreement, Pfizer is entitled to nominate the remaining two targets by November 2017.

Our R&D Platform and Proprietary Technology 
 We believe that our proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform is an engine for nucleic acid development and places us in a unique position to deliver drugs to underserved patient populations. We believe that, based on our candidate design and selection process, our platform technology can potentially be applied to treat a significant number of target indications. These targets span multiple therapeutic areas and may be addressed with various modalities best suited for a given indication.   
 Our novel platform technology enables the development of PO/PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize therapeutically optimized stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to create stereopure PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics, meaning drugs where the configuration of each chiral PS linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis. Our unique approach also enables us to use rational drug design, whereby we employ the conventional wisdom of small molecule drug 
 4

discovery and apply these insights to nucleic acid therapeutic development. After identifying the target sequence, we are able to precisely control the oligonucleotide stereochemistry and determine the most suitable modality, such as antisense or exon skipping.  We believe that our rational and methodical approach enables the optimization of several key elements of drug design, including stability, specificity, activity, and immunogenicity.  We believe our platform technology has broad application as it does not rely upon a particular chemistry or particular nucleotide sequence, thereby creating opportunities to optimize across a larger number of therapeutic areas. 
 We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological activity). Our portfolio also includes filings for both proprietary methods and reagents, as well as various chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. In addition, our portfolio includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside and/or backbone modification, pattern of backbone linkages and/or pattern of backbone chiral centers. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are leveraging our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform to design, develop and commercialize optimized disease-modifying nucleic acid therapeutics for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. We are focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. 
 The key components of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | Maintain and extend our leadership in oligonucleotide stereochemistry. We intend to establish a dominant position in the field of oligonucleotide stereochemistry, advancing basic research and pharmacology across multiple therapeutic modalities and target classes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our development candidates. We currently have three development programs in neurology: WVE-120101, WVE-120102 and WVE-210201. These programs in Huntington’s disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are our most advanced therapeutic programs. In HD, we have programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2; in DMD, we are targeting exon 51. We expect to advance all three programs into clinical development in 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain our focus on neurology. We are committed to maintaining our focus on rare genetic diseases in neurology, which we broadly define as CNS and the neuromuscular system. We believe there are several areas within neurology that we can uniquely address with our stereopure nucleic acid chemistry to reach underserved patient populations who may potentially benefit from our technology. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further invest to broaden our platform. We remain focused and disciplined with investments in our platform that we believe will enable a sustainable engine for future growth. We believe our platform will drive the discovery and advancement of stereopure therapeutic candidates in both our core focus area of neurology and additional therapeutic areas. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deepen our pipeline. We continue to leverage our platform and plan to identify three additional candidates in 2017 that will enable us to potentially broaden our pipeline to six wholly-owned development programs by the end of 2018, as well as additional partnerships and collaborations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish manufacturing leadership in oligonucleotides. To provide internal current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) manufacturing capabilities and increase our control and visibility of our drug product supply chain, we signed a lease in 2016 for a manufacturing facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, Massachusetts that we plan to occupy late in the second quarter of 2017. We expect that our internal expertise in cGMP manufacturing will better facilitate our growth and secure availability of drug product for current and future development activities and, potentially, commercial-scale manufacturing. In addition, we believe we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the design, development and commercialization of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. We intend to file new patent applications and take other steps to leverage, expand and enforce our intellectual property position.

Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 The majority of traditional therapeutics, such as small molecule drugs and biologics, work by interacting with proteins that contribute to the disease. However, there are thought to be a limited number of “druggable” proteins; it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of human protein targets cannot be addressed by these conventional approaches. By contrast, we believe that directing medicines 
 5

to the ribonucleic acid (“RNA”), which is critical to the production of proteins, rather than to the proteins themselves, has the potential to significantly increase the number of druggable targets. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics is an innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target RNAs to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins. Nucleic acid therapeutics employ a number of different molecular mechanisms to regulate protein production. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized as silencing, those that promote degradation of the target RNA, including antisense and RNAi, and splicing, those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function by promoting exon skipping and RNA-guided gene editing. 
 The unique capability of nucleic acid therapeutics to address a wide range of genomic targets across multiple therapeutic areas has the potential to create potentially significant market opportunities to develop drugs to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases, including diseases where no medicines currently exist or for which existing treatments are not optimal. 
 The nucleic acid therapeutics we are currently developing employ the following molecular mechanisms: 
  
• | Antisense, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA strand that encodes a disease-associated protein. The resulting two-stranded molecule (“duplex”) is then recognized by a cellular enzyme called RNase H, which cleaves, or cuts, the target RNA in the duplex, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA interference (“RNAi”) which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to recognize a specific sequence and engages RNA interference machinery known as RISC complex to silence target RNA that encodes a disease-associated protein, thereby preventing the protein from being made.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Splicing, which is the processing of the nascent precursor messenger RNA (“pre-mRNA”) transcript into messenger RNA (“mRNA”). After splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together, or ligated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exon skipping, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a particular sequence within a target RNA and direct the cellular machinery to delete, or splice, certain specific regions out of that RNA. Often, the underlying mutation in the target RNA leads to a “stop” instruction, so that, absent the therapeutic oligonucleotide, non-productive mRNA is produced. Use of the exon skipping oligonucleotide permits the cellular machinery to correct the “stop” instruction and assemble a partially functional protein, thereby mitigating or alleviating the disease that would otherwise result from the genetic mutation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 A large subset of nucleic acid therapeutics is comprised of chemically modified, short-length RNA or deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) strands, commonly known as oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA and DNA—that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester (PO) bonds, as shown below. 
 
Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics because they are rapidly degraded by enzymes called nucleases that are widely present in the human body, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and have poor uptake into targeted cells. The industry has employed chemical modifications of the nucleotides and phosphodiester bonds to improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of nucleic acid therapeutics. 
 Phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification was one of the earliest and remains one of the most common backbone modifications used in nucleic acid therapeutics. In PS modification, one of the nonbridging oxygen (O) atoms bonded to a phosphorus (P) atom is replaced with a sulfur (S) atom. PS modification has been shown to improve the stability of oligonucleotides by making them less susceptible 
 6

to enzymatic degradation. Further, PS bond-containing oligonucleotides increase binding to plasma proteins, which improves biodistribution by preventing rapid renal excretion of these molecules. 
 Whereas traditional modifications require full replacement of the naturally occurring phosophodiester (PO) with phosphorothioate (PS), we are able to judiciously use a combination of PO and PS in our steropure nucleic acids. We believe this ability to selectively employ PS modification where desired may provide further control over pharmacodynamics and may improve the safety of our drugs. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics are a relatively “new” class of drugs from the perspective of regulatory approvals. The first approval of a nucleic acid therapeutic by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), occurred in 1998, and the most recent FDA approval of a nucleic acid therapeutic occurred in 2016.  Nucleic acid therapeutic candidates that employ PS modification are being developed by several different companies. PS modification is accepted as state-of-the-art advancement in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe that PS modification will remain a key component of nucleic acid therapeutic development.  
 PS Modification Results in Complex Drug Mixtures 
 A consequence of using PS modification in oligonucleotide synthesis is that it creates a chiral center at each phosphorus, each of which is designated as either an “Sp” or “Rp” configuration. This chirality creates stereoisomers, which, as shown below, have identical chemical composition but different three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms and consequently different chemical and biological properties. 
 

The configuration of each PS modification occurs randomly during conventional nucleic acid synthesis. Because oligonucleotides are comprised of numerous nucleotides and associated PS modifications—with each PS modification having a random chiral configuration—the synthesis process generates an exponentially large number of stereoisomers of the synthesized oligonucleotide. Specifically, each linkage of an additional nucleotide residue doubles the number of stereoisomers of the product, so that a conventional preparation of a PS-containing oligonucleotide is in fact a highly heterogeneous mixtures of 2N stereoisomers, where N represents the number of PS modifications. For instance, as shown below, a conventional fully PS modified oligonucleotide (20 nucleotides in length, 19 PS modifications) in fact is a mixture of over 500,000 stereoisomers, each having the same nucleotide sequence but differing in the stereochemistry along their backbones. 
 
7

Stereoisomers often possess different chemical and pharmacologic properties. For example, certain stereoisomers can drive the therapeutic effects of a drug while others can be less beneficial or can even contribute to undesirable side effects. The greater the variation among a drug’s constituent stereoisomers, the greater the potential to diminish the drug’s efficacy and safety. 
 Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to create stereopure PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics, meaning drugs where the configuration of each chiral PS linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis. Moreover, because of the sheer number of stereoisomers present in a mixture, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to physically isolate the most therapeutically optimal stereoisomer from within a mixture. For these reasons, all of the PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others are mixtures of many stereoisomers, which we believe are not optimized for stability, catalytic activity, efficacy or toxicity. 
 In small molecule therapeutics, U.S. regulators have long sought to eliminate the risks potentially posed by drug mixtures containing multiple stereoisomers. Since 1992, the FDA has recommended full molecular characterization of stereoisomers within small molecule drug mixtures. Historically, it has not been possible to achieve such characterization of nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures, which can contain tens of thousands to millions of distinct pharmacologic entities. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe we have the ability to design and synthesize stereopure PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics, which in preclinical models have shown superior drug properties compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe our drug development platform has the potential to set a new industry standard for the molecular characterization of complex nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures. 
 Our Solution: Controlling Stereochemistry and Employing Rational Design in Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 We have developed proprietary chemistry that, for the first time, enables the development of PO/PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize therapeutically optimized stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. 
 In addition, our rational drug design process of stereopure oligonucleotides employs selective and judicious use of PS modifications, which allows us to retain naturally occurring PO nucleic acids in our therapeutics. We believe the inclusion of phosphodiesters in our nucleic acid designs may contribute to increased safety and reduced renal accumulation. 
 
We have discovered and expect to continue to identify fundamental relationships between pharmacology and the three-dimensional orientation or arrangement of atoms within an oligonucleotide, including stability, catalytic activity, specificity, safety and immunogenicity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. We have rationally designed and synthesized stereopure PO/PS modified drugs that, in preclinical studies, have demonstrated superior stability or potency, or both, as compared to their respective parent drug mixtures, which may result in increased durability of effect, as well as increased specificity and decreased immune activity. Therefore, we expect our stereopure PO/PS modified drugs to have improved safety profiles and to be dosed at lower concentrations or less frequently, or both, compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. We are using these discoveries to guide our drug development activities. 
 Advantages of Our Approach 
 We believe that our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform is a significant advance in the development of nucleic acid therapeutics. The advantages of our approach include: 

• | Ability to rationally design drugs with optimized pharmacological properties. Our platform reduces susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and renal clearance and optimizes interactions with proteins that mediate activity as well as those that affect safety and tolerability. Our ability to improve pharmacologic stability and reduce clearance can enhance the biodistribution of single-stranded oligonucleotides to multiple tissues following systemic administration without the need for additional delivery technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applicability. Our platform is applicable to multiple RNA-targeting approaches, including antisense, RNAi, exon skipping, splicing, RNA-guided gene editing, microRNA and others, and is compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications and targeting moieties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary production of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. Our scientists have developed expertise in the techniques required to produce adequate supplies of PS modified stereopure nucleic acid therapeutic materials for our preclinical and planned clinical activities. In addition, we believe we have the intellectual property position and know-how necessary to protect, advance and scale these production processes to support our clinical trials and potential future commercial supply.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

 
• | Scalability and Manufacturing. Our manufacturing process and technical expertise in designing stereopure oligonucleotides is unique in nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe that our scalable synthesis processes will allow us to meet demand for cGMP-qualified clinical trial supply, as well as the potential for commercial manufacturing at a cost of goods and potential cost-per-patient that are comparable to traditional methods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Chemistry – Proof of Concept 
 We have demonstrated in preclinical models, predictive of human biology, that direct relationships exist between stereochemistry and pharmacology, and that these relationships can be used to rationally design and construct nucleic acid therapeutics. In proof-of-concept studies, we examined diverse sets of oligonucleotides designed and synthesized using our platform, which allowed us to characterize and compare the behavior of various stereoisomers. These preclinical studies have demonstrated that by controlling stereochemistry, we can optimize multiple aspects of pharmacology, including stability, catalytic activity, specificity, safety and immunogenicity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. As with any drug under development, we cannot be certain that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics will demonstrate in humans the same favorable pharmacologic properties we have observed in the preclinical studies we have conducted to date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Discovery, Manufacturing, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates” for a discussion of the risks associated with the development of pharmaceuticals, and nucleic acid therapeutics in particular. 
 To assess the relationship between stereochemistry and pharmacology, we conducted studies of mipomersen using a diverse set of stereoisomers alongside the parent mixture. We chose to study mipomersen because at the time it was the only systemically administered nucleic acid therapeutic approved for commercialization and because of the public availability of documents from the regulatory bodies that have evaluated mipomersen for marketing approval. Mipomersen, which is currently marketed by Kastle Therapeutics and was marketed by Genzyme Corporation, a Sanofi Company, under the brand name KYNAMRO, is approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and is designed to silence production of apolipoprotein B (“ApoB”). While mipomersen received marketing authorization in the United States, concerns about the drug’s tolerability and liver and cardio-vascular safety led the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in 2012 to refuse to grant marketing authorization for mipomersen in the European Union. One of the EMA’s central concerns about mipomersen was that a high proportion of patients stopped taking the drug within two years, mainly due to side effects such as flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions and liver toxicity. The EMA considered these side effects important because mipomersen is intended for long-term treatment in order to maintain its cholesterol-lowering effect. 
 Mipomersen is an oligonucleotide that contains 20 nucleotides and 19 PS modifications. The chirality of each PS modification has the effect of doubling the number of stereoisomers at each phosphorus and, therefore, mipomersen is actually a mixture of over 500,000 different stereoisomers (219 = 524,288), or a stereomixture. We rationally designed and synthesized individual stereoisomers of mipomersen, each having specific and different stereochemistry, and conducted studies comparing the stereoisomers with the mipomersen stereomixture. 
 Stability 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and stability by exposing our panel of individual mipomersen stereoisomers and the mipomersen stereomixture to metabolic enzymes, including nucleases, in homogenate rat liver and rat serum. Each stereoisomer and the mipomersen stereomixture were incubated separately in rat whole-liver homogenate for five days at physiological temperature and the percentage of each full-length stereoisomer and the mipomersen stereomixture remaining was measured daily. 
 9

As shown in the graph below, by day five, less than 15% of the stereomixture remained. In contrast, at day five, over 50% of our stereopure isomers 1 and 2 remained, indicating that these individual stereoisomers have greater stability than the stereomixture. However, the mipomersen stereomixture was more stable than stereoisomers 4, 5, 6 and 7. 
 
Similar results were observed when the stability of the stereomixture and selected stereoisomers were compared in rat serum. 
 Catalytic Activity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and catalytic activity, which, in the case of antisense, is a measure of the efficiency with which the drug can knockdown the target. Efficient catalytic activity is critical for optimized pharmacology of drugs like mipomersen. 
 In the body, mipomersen uses a cellular enzyme called RNase H to degrade or knockdown ApoB mRNA. Using in vitro assays of human RNase H, we evaluated the catalytic activity of the same panel of stereoisomers described above compared with the stereomixture. Stereoisomers or stereomixtures were bound to target ApoB mRNA and incubated with human RNase H to initiate the catalytic reaction. The reaction was stopped at various time-points and the amount of full-length target ApoB mRNA remaining was measured. 
 As shown below, stereoisomers and the stereomixture exhibited large differences in their catalytic activity, as demonstrated by their efficiency in reducing the amount of the full-length target remaining over time. Certain stereoisomers, most notably stereoisomer 2, demonstrated catalytic activity at levels far superior to that of the stereomixture. Also, importantly, we identified stereoisomers that exhibited lower efficiency levels, most notably isomer 4. 
 
Based on these and other data, we have established key design principles relating stereochemistry and catalytic efficiency using RNase H-mediated antisense. These principles can be applied across antisense therapeutics and are compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications to the drug molecule. 
 10

We believe that, based on these studies and others we have conducted, it is possible to synthesize stereopure nucleic acid therapies possessing increased stability and catalytic activity for any PS modified nucleic acid therapeutic independent of nucleotide sequence composition. 
 Efficacy 
 We assessed whether improved stability and catalytic activity of our stereoisomers will translate into greater efficacy in an in vivo pharmacological study. We administered our panel of stereoisomers and the stereomixture to transgenic mice that express human ApoB. This validated animal model was included in the preclinical package used for the regulatory approval of mipomersen in the United States. 
 Mice were injected twice weekly with 10 milligrams per kilogram of our stereoisomer 2, our stereoisomer 5 or the stereomixture over a four-week period. ApoB protein levels in the mice’s serum were measured on a weekly basis. This treatment protocol and study design replicates the preclinical in vivo pharmacology study for mipomersen included in the regulatory submission for mipomersen. 
 As shown in the graph below, during the treatment period (up to day 28), stereoisomers 2 and 5, which as described above demonstrated increased catalytic activity in vitro compared with the stereomixture, also achieved greater reduction in serum ApoB compared with the stereomixture. In the graph below, levels of ApoB in serum are expressed as a percentage of ApoB at baseline, which was 100%. Knockdown of ApoB by the stereomixture decreased dramatically following final dose. This effect was also observed for stereoisomer 5, which had increased catalytic activity compared with the stereomixture but lowered stability. In comparison, stereoisomer 2, which had superior catalytic activity and stability, demonstrated durable knockdown of serum ApoB for over two weeks after the final dose. 
 
These results demonstrate our ability to rationally design PS modified nucleic acid therapeutics that, in a preclinical setting, have greater stability and catalytic activity, which we believe have the potential to lead to improved efficacy and durability of effect. 
 11

Specificity 
 By controlling stereochemistry, we have discovered that the pattern of cleavage caused by PS modified antisense, within the target RNA, can be changed, including directing cleavage toward specific sites within the target. This unique capability enables the cleavage of target RNA to be sensitive to small differences between similar targets, where cleavage may be undesirable or potentially unsafe. 
 For example, Huntington’s disease is caused by mutations in one allele (which is one of two or more versions of a gene) of the huntingtin gene, resulting in the production of a disease-causing protein, while the other allele encodes a healthy protein. By optimizing stereochemistry, we are able to direct cleavage towards single-nucleotide differences between these alleles and silence the disease-causing huntingtin RNA while leaving the healthy huntingtin RNA intact. 
 Stereoisomers or stereomixtures were bound to mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA and incubated with human RNase H to initiate the catalytic reaction. The reaction was stopped at various time-points and the amount of full-length mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA remaining was measured. 
 Using these in vitro assays of human RNase H, we observed that the stereomixture (left figure) caused substantial reductions in both the mutant and healthy huntingtin RNA, while the optimized stereoisomers (right figure) preferentially cleaved mutant huntingtin RNA while sparing the healthy huntingtin RNA. 
 

We believe our unique ability to change the cleavage pattern of PS modified nucleic acid therapies with stereochemistry will create opportunities to mitigate unwanted cleavage and also open allele-specific targeting (meaning the preferential interaction of an oligonucleotide with target RNA transcribed from one allele of a given gene) involving causative or associated non-causative genetic variations. 
 Through these studies, we have demonstrated an ability to use stereochemistry in the preclinical setting to control cleavage and reduce off-target cleavage. We believe these findings can be applied in the design of nucleic acid therapies that target a range of variation-specific disease targets. 
 12

Immunogenicity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and immunogenicity, which is the ability of a substance to activate an immune response. Immune activation has been observed with PS modified oligonucleotides in preclinical toxicology studies, and flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions in clinical studies are believed to be immune mediated. 
 Using non-human primate serum we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to our panel of individual stereoisomers and the parent stereomixtures. Each isomer and parent stereomixture were incubated at physiological temperature in non-human primate serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times and complement activation was measured by measuring the increase in the amount of protein C3a. Protein C3a is formed by the cleavage of complement component 3 upon activation of the complement system, and its levels in serum increase in direct proportion to the amount of activation. Such measurements were taken using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) analytical method, a technique used to determine the amount of a specific protein present in a biological sample and which requires an antibody that is specific to the protein of interest, which is linked to an enzyme whose activity can be used to quantify the amount of protein present. 
 As shown below, equal concentrations of stereoisomers and the stereomixture exhibited differences in the levels of C3a. Certain stereoisomers showed greater than twice the reduction in C3a compared to the stereomixture. We believe that, based on these studies, it is possible to modulate complement activation and potentially reduce immunogenicity of PS modified oligonucleotides by controlling stereochemistry.

In addition, human TLR9 reporter assay and human PBMC cytokine panel (IL-6 and MIP-1b are key cytokines in B-cell and macrophage activation, respectively) provide further validation of stereochemistry impact on immunogenicity. Conventional wisdom states that 5-methyl C (5mC) and 2’ modification are sufficient to avoid immune activation. However, substantial immune activation exists within highly stable compounds despite the incorporation of these modifications, as seen below. The WAVE chemistry platform enables reduced activation of the immune system.

Our Pipeline 
 We are developing nucleic acid therapeutics for genetically defined diseases that we believe are capable of targeting a wide range of organ systems and tissues. Based on our design principles, we have demonstrated in preclinical studies our ability to rapidly design and select lead therapeutic candidates with optimized pharmacological properties. We believe that our platform can potentially be used in the near-term to develop treatments for several other target indications.  Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in Huntington’s disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In HD, we have programs targeting HTT SNP-1 and HTT SNP-2; in DMD, we are targeting exon 51. We anticipate initiating clinical development of all three programs in 2017. See “Our Initial Therapeutic Candidates” for more information about these targets. We also have early-stage discovery programs in which we are focused on screening activities and lead optimization for potential drug candidates targeting various areas, including eye, hepatic and neuromuscular and central nervous system diseases. 
 Our current programs in development and our exploratory portfolio are summarized in the table below:
 

Our Initial Therapeutic Candidates 
 Our lead development programs target Huntington’s disease (WVE-120101 and WVE-120102) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (WVE-210201).  
 
Huntington’s Disease 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 Huntington’s disease (“HD”), is an orphan hereditary neurodegenerative disease that is fatal and for which there is no cure. HD results from the accumulation of the defective gene product mutant huntingtin (“mHTT”), which promotes the degeneration of neurons. This accumulation is caused by an expanded CAG triplet repeat in the HTT gene, which results in production of mutant HTT (mHTT) protein. Accumulation of mHTT causes progressive loss of neurons in the brain, and can lead to neuronal cell death, causing motor, cognitive and psychiatric disability. HD patients still possess wild type (healthy) HTT protein, which is believed to be critical for neuronal function, and suppression may have detrimental long-term consequences. Absence of healthy huntingtin protein has been shown to be embryonic lethal. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and worsen over the next 10 to 20 years. 
 15

Many describe the symptoms of HD as having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease simultaneously. Patients experience a reduction in motor function and psychological disturbances. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 20 years. In the later stages, often lasting over ten years, movements become increasingly difficult to control. Affected persons become fully dependent upon others for assistance with activities of daily living (“ADLs”), lose the ability to walk, and often require placement in a long-term care facility. We estimate that approximately 30,000 people in the United States have symptomatic HD and more than 200,000 others have a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder from their affected parent.
Current Treatments 
 Currently, there are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow down the course of HD. Some of the symptoms of HD can be managed with medication and therapies. Antipsychotics and other drugs affecting the dopamine pathways are used for symptom control. Lowering the levels of mHTT protein has demonstrated therapeutic effects in animal models. Roche and Ionis Pharmaceuticals have antisense oligonucleotides that are non allele specific to silence the huntingtin gene in Phase 1/2a clinical development, with human trials having commenced in July 2015. 
Our Programs
 We are advancing two therapeutic candidates, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (“SNPs”), associated with the mutant alleles of the huntingtin gene. The precise targeting of mutant alleles by stereochemically controlled (“stereopure”) oligonucleotides should allow discrimination and selective silencing of the mutant huntingtin messenger RNA transcripts that lead to the production of the mutant protein associated with manifestations of the disease while leaving normal huntingtin transcripts and protein relatively intact. Each SNP has a particular demographic distribution, and defines a subpopulation of patients suited for allele-specific interventions. More than two-thirds of the HD patient population possess one of the two most common SNPs. Therefore, we are attempting to develop oligonucleotides targeting these two SNPs. If approved, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 would be the first allele-specific therapies for HD patients. If approved, our allele-specific approach may also enable us to address the pre-manifest HD patient population.
 We have completed our initial preclinical studies intended to establish the safety and distribution of our stereopure antisense oligonucleotides. The Phase 1b/2a clinical trials are designed to conduct two simultaneous multi-ascending-dose (“MAD”) trials targeting SNP-1 and SNP-2, respectively, to establish the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects, and potentially preliminary evidence of therapeutic effect in patients with early manifest HD. Key inclusion criteria is expected to be stage I or II patients between the ages of 25-65. The route of administration will be intrathecal by lumbar puncture. We expect to dose on a monthly basis or potentially less frequently. We believe that the ability to selectively reduce mutant huntingtin, as demonstrated in our preclinical studies, may enable us to proceed rapidly to clinical proof-of-concept studies to assess target engagement in SNP-1 and SNP-2 positive patients. cGMP-manufactured supplies of WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 have been completed to conduct the Phase 1b/2a clinical trials. As part of our HD global development strategy, we expect to initiate clinical development of both allele-specific HD programs in mid-2017. 
 16

In our preclinical studies, as shown below, huntingtin targeted stereoisomer 1 (circles) or stereomixture (triangles) drugs were bound to healthy and mutant huntingtin mRNA and incubated with human RNase H (left figure). Catalysis mediated by the stereopure drug increased the degree of knockdown while also discriminating between healthy versus mutant huntingtin, compared with the stereomixture. 
 

Using non-human primate serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to a panel of huntingtin targeted stereoisomers and the parent stereomixture. Each isomer and parent stereomixture was incubated at physiological temperature in non-human primate serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times and complement activation was measured by the increase in C3a levels using the ELISA analytical method. As shown above (right figure), certain stereoisomers and the stereomixture demonstrated increased production of C3a, notably stereoisomer 3, however there was no production of C3a following exposure to stereoisomer 1, which showed discrimination between heathy and mutant huntingtin. 
 
17

Our HD SNP-1 candidate, WVE-120101, was tested for potency and selectivity of knocking down U-variant HTT/mutant HTT (mHTT), or the mutant disease-causing allele. As shown in above, WVE-120101 potently reduced mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein, and exhibited great selectivity for mHTT at all the doses tested. WVE-120101 targeting U-variant HTT was co-transfected into HEK293 cells with two reporter plasmids: a plasmid with V5-tagged full-length HTT containing the U-variant SNP-1 and a plasmid with FLAG-tagged full-length HTT containing the C-variant SNP-1. The knockdown of mHTT mRNA and mHTT protein was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. All results were normalized to a non-specific stereorandom control. The preclinical data demonstrate the ability to knock down the mutant allele while leaving the wild type, healthy allele intact. 
 


Following promising preclinical data, we have also investigated distribution characteristics of our lead HD candidate. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe stereochemistry enables improved protein binding and distribution, as evidenced by the NHP distribution data seen above. The figure above demonstrates meaningful distribution in a non-human primate (“NHP”) study of WVE-120101. In this preclinical study, we employed an in situ hybridization (“ISH”) ViewRNA assay. The ViewRNA assay provides the ability to stain oligonucleotides, allowing increased visibility and understanding of distribution of WVE-120101 in the brain. As shown above, our lead HD SNP-1 candidate, WVE-120101, is stained in red.  Results demonstrated perinuclear and nuclear distribution of WVE-120101 (red) in NHP gray matter structures following intrathecal administration. The NHP viewRNA assay demonstrated broad tissue distribution, including the cortex and striatum. These findings are encouraging as we believe distribution and penetration into several areas of the brain will be beneficial for the treatment of HD.    
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (“DMD”), is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome that affects approximately one in 3,500 newborn boys around the world. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, the dystrophin protein is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex that acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell’s structural framework with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell through the muscle cell membrane. The dystrophin-associated protein complex protects the muscle from injury during contraction and relaxation. DMD patients typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, DMD patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20 and few individuals with DMD live beyond their 30’s.  
 18

Current Treatments 
 There is currently one FDA-approved exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic in the United States, Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 (eteplirsen), which was approved in September 2016. Exon skipping allows for the production of shortened, but functional, dystrophin protein instead of dysfunctional dystrophin. In September 2016, the FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.  According to U.S. accelerated approval guidelines, no clinical benefit needs to be established at the time of FDA approval, and no clinical benefit of eteplirsen has yet been established. Thus, consistent with the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, eteplirsen is the subject of a post-marketing approval clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required clinical trial is designed to assess whether eteplirsen improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.  
 In Europe, conditional market authorization has been granted to PTC Therapeutics’ TRANSLARNA (ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients who are 5 years or older. The FDA has also granted a standard review and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of October, 24, 2017. Another exon-skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD is BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s drisapersen, for which the FDA issued a complete response letter in January 2016 indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the application was not ready for approval in its present form. In addition, treatments aimed to address the symptoms of DMD include corticosteroids and physical and respiratory therapy to slow the decline in muscle strength and to prolong ambulation and respiratory function. In addition, in February 2017, the FDA approved Emflaza (deflazacort), the first corticosteroid approved as a treatment in the United States for DMD patients older than 5 years of age. 
 Our Program 
 Based on our interactions with the DMD patient community and DMD patient advocacy groups, despite the availability of eteplirsen in the U.S. and ataluren in the EU, we believe that there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in DMD patients.  We are developing stereochemically optimized oligonucleotides that we believe have superior pharmacology attributes as compared to stereomixtures. Using a variety of preclinical in vitro assays, we will advance WVE-210201, our stereopure exon skipping candidate that targets exon 51, to clinical trials because we believe it has the potential to benefit the estimated 13% of the DMD patient population that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. 
 As described below, preclinical quantitative western blot studies of WVE-210201 demonstrated 52% dystrophin protein restoration as compared with normal skeletal muscle tissue lysates, versus approximately 1% when testing other exon skipping therapies in vitro. We are developing our clinical trial protocol for our clinical trial for WVE-210201 and intend to include both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients in our clinical trial, as well as patients previously treated with other exon skipping therapies after appropriate washout. Preclinical toxicology studies are currently underway. Our internal cGMP manufacturing is ongoing to support our planned clinical trials. We plan to initiate our global clinical development program for WVE-210201 in the second half of 2017.
 19

WVE-210201 was selected for further development, in part, based on its ability to demonstrate efficient restoration of dystrophin production in patient-derived muscle cells. Efficiency at skipping exon 51 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR following exposure to equal concentrations of oligonucleotides. As shown below, our stereoisomers demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in exon skipping efficiency compared to eteplirsen and drisapersen.  
 

20

Using patient-derived muscle cells, we analyzed protein restoration by western blot with gymnotic uptake, meaning delivery of drug candidate to the cell in the absence of any carriers or conjugation, at 10µM concentration of each compound. The extent of dystrophin protein restoration in vitro was quantified to be between 50% - 100% of normal skeletal lysates, as compared to about 1% by drisapersen or eteplirsen at this concentration. 
 


We believe that the use of a stereochemically-optimized compound (in contrast to a stereomixture) has the potential to reduce the frequency and severity of significant adverse events incident to stereomixtures, such as injection site reactions, renal toxicity and thrombocytopenia. Our Phase 1b/2a clinical trials in WVE-210201 will seek to establish safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficiency of exon skipping. The efficiency of exon skipping will be determined through measurement of restored production of shortened dystrophin protein in muscle biopsies.  Such a positive effect over time would be expected to lead to improvement in muscle function, which is an anticipated clinical endpoint of our clinical trials. 
 We have selected WAVE isomer-1 as our lead DMD candidate, WVE-210201. Preclinical quantitative Western blot studies of WAVE’s DMD exon 51 candidate demonstrated 52% dystrophin protein restoration as compared with normal skeletal muscle tissue lysates, versus approximately 1% when testing other exon skipping therapies, as shown above. WAVE isomer-1 was selected due to its more favorable profile, including potency, stability and safety.  
 Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations 
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of nucleic acid therapies. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, license and research collaboration agreements as a means of seeking to advance our own nucleic acid therapeutic programs in neurology, investing in third party technologies to further strengthen our drug development platform and leveraging external partnerships to extend the reach of our drug development platform in therapeutic areas outside of neurology where our technology demonstrates a competitive advantage.

Our Partnerships 
 Pfizer
 In May 2016, we entered into a research, license and option agreement with Pfizer Inc. (the “Collaboration Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Pfizer agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of stereopure oligonucleotide therapeutics for up to five programs (“the Pfizer Programs”), each directed at a genetically-defined hepatic target selected by Pfizer (the “Collaboration”). Under the terms of the agreements we entered into with Pfizer and its affiliate, Pfizer paid us $40.0 million upfront, $30.0 million of which took the form of an equity investment in our ordinary shares, as described below. Subject to option exercises by Pfizer, assuming five potential products are successfully developed and commercialized, we may earn up to $871.0 million in potential research, development and commercial milestone payments, plus royalties, tiered up to low double-digits, on sales of any products that may result from the Collaboration. 
 
Under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties agreed to collaborate during the four-year research term. During the research term, we are responsible to use our commercially reasonable efforts to advance up to five programs through to the selection of clinical candidates. At that stage, Pfizer may elect to license any of these programs exclusively and to have exclusive rights to undertake the clinical development of the clinical candidates into products and the potential commercialization of any such products thereafter. In addition, under the Collaboration, we receive a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicenseable license to use Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology in any of our own hepatic programs that are outside the scope of the collaboration (the “WAVE Programs”). If we use Pfizer’s technology on our programs, Pfizer is eligible to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments from us. Pfizer is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of any products that include Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology.
 As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Pfizer had declared three hepatic targets, including our Apolipoprotein C-III program and two undisclosed programs, with the remaining two hepatic targets to be declared by November 2017.  Also in connection with the Collaboration, Pfizer agreed that it will be subject to a standstill such that,  for a certain period of time, neither Pfizer nor its controlled affiliates, except as we expressly approve in writing, will, subject to certain conditions, directly or indirectly, acquire our outstanding ordinary shares, seek to call any meeting of our shareholders, solicit proxies or consents in opposition to the recommendation of a majority of our board of directors with respect to any matter or undertake other specified actions related to the potential acquisition of additional equity interests in the Company. The term of the Collaboration Agreement runs from the effective date until the date of the last to expire payment obligations with respect to each Pfizer Program and with respect to each WAVE Program, and expires on a program-by-program basis accordingly. 
 
Simultaneously with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we entered into a share purchase agreement with C.P. Pharmaceuticals International C.V., an affiliate of Pfizer (the “Pfizer affiliate”). Pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Pfizer affiliate purchased 1,875,000 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $30.0 million. The shares purchased by the Pfizer affiliate are subject to lock-up restrictions and carry certain registration rights outlined in the share purchase agreement.  
 Our Technology Licenses 
 Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH 
 In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH (“MI”), pursuant to which we obtained a co-exclusive royalty-bearing, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products in all fields of use under certain patent rights owned by Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (“MPG”), and patent rights owned by University of Massachusetts Medical School (“UMMS”), which has been granted to us by MI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPG, acting as MPG’s technology transfer agency and UMMS’s authorized licensing agency for such patents. MPG and MI are collectively referred to herein as Max-Planck. 
 Our patent rights under this license are to patent filings that relate to certain sequence and structural features of single-stranded RNA molecules that mediate target-specific RNA interference, and include both filings that are owned by Max-Planck and arose from research conducted by Thomas Tuschl, Ph.D. and his colleagues at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and also an issued U.S. patent owned by the University of Massachusetts (“UMASS”), that prevailed in an interference with one of the Max-Planck filings and was subsequently included, through a separate agreement between Max-Planck and UMASS, within the portfolio that Max-Planck is authorized to license. The Max-Planck licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. and Canadian patents, and pending U.S. and European patent applications, each of which has a projected 20-year term that extends into 2023. We intend to develop and commercialize diagnostic and therapeutic products based on our patent rights under this license, although currently we do not rely on the patent rights under this license for any of our drug candidates under development in our therapeutic or discovery programs. Max-Planck retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for non-commercial purposes. 
 22

Our license is one of two maximum allowable co-exclusive licenses for these patents, the other of which is currently held by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ionis”). If either we terminate our or Ionis terminates its respective co-exclusive portion of the license, Max-Planck is obligated to grant the other party an exclusive license on substantially the same terms and conditions previously applicable to the terminated co-exclusive licensee. 
 Under certain conditions, we are permitted to sublicense our rights under the license. The license requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products under the agreement, whether solely or through our affiliates and sublicensees. In order to secure the license, we made an upfront payment of less than $0.1 million to Max-Planck. Additionally, starting on the first anniversary of the agreement, we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees of less than $0.1 million to Max-Planck which are to be credited against any royalties payable for the applicable calendar year. We will be required to make payments based upon regulatory milestones, including the initiation of clinical trials, and product approval milestones totaling up to $1.6 million for each licensed product reaching such clinical stage, provided that such milestone payments will only be payable once per target irrespective of the number of licensed products targeting such target to achieve such milestones. In addition to milestone payments, we will be required to pay royalties of a percentage of cumulative annual net sales of a licensed product commercialized by us, our affiliates and sublicensees. The percentage is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Max-Planck are subject to reduction for any third party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. If we grant a sublicense of our rights under this license, we will be obligated to pay Max-Planck a percentage of specified sublicensing consideration received from such sublicensee attributable to the sublicense granted under the licensed patents, ranging from the mid-single digits to the low thirties depending on the stage of development at the time the sublicense is executed. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice and payment of all accrued amounts owing to Max-Planck. Max-Planck may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we challenge the validity of its patents, upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo a change of control and cannot demonstrate that we will maintain a development and commercialization program that is substantially similar or greater in scope than the program prior to the change of control event, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach (or 45 days in the case of nonpayment). Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the later of the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications with the patent rights covered by the agreement or April 28, 2019. 
 Our Research Collaborations 
 University of Oxford; Professor Matthew Wood’s Laboratory 
 Since April 2015, we have been collaborating with Dr. Matthew J.A. Wood, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Oxford and Co-Director of the Oxford Centre for Neuromuscular Science under a translational research collaboration agreement with The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford (“Oxford”). Dr. Wood’s research is in the field of degenerative disorders of the nervous system and muscle. His laboratory’s main focus is the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches using short nucleic acids to target messenger RNA (“mRNA”). His team has been investigating the potential of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides for the modification of mRNA splicing, for example in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In addition, his laboratory’s work includes the potential of double-stranded RNA for gene silencing (“RNAi”), for the silencing of target genes and mutant alleles both in muscle and in the nervous system. In October 2016, we extended our research collaboration for an additional 18 months in order for Oxford to characterize our proprietary isomers in murine models to further improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides using our novel chemistries, and to discover biomarkers associated with disease progression and pharmacological activity for the treatment of DMD. Under this collaboration, we are exploring additional exon targets, including exon 45, exon 53 and exon 44 beyond our lead DMD program, which targets exon 51.
University of Dundee 
 Since September 2015, we have been conducting research in collaboration with the University of Dundee (“Dundee”) that involves characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of keratin disorders. We and Dundee recently submitted a collaborative proposal for funding to the Medical Research Council (“MRC”), to support the project entitled ‘Delivering gene silencing therapy to the epidermic and ocular surface’. MRC has accepted the proposal and has issued an offer of a five-year grant to support this proposed research.
University of Massachusetts Medical School
 In January 2017, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with University of Massachusetts Medical School (“UMMS”), to deepen our knowledge and experience in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). Research under this collaboration is being conducted by Dr. Robert H. Brown, Jr., the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at UMMS, an internationally known researcher and physician in 
 23

the field.  Our research collaboration with UMMS is initially focused on characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of ALS. 
 nLife Therapeutics S.L.
 In October 2016, we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement with nLife Therapeutics S.L., an early-stage biopharmaceutical company developing chemical conjugates technologies, aimed at exploring cell-specific targeting of nucleic acid therapeutics in the CNS. For the two-year term that commenced in October 2016, nLife and WAVE are collaborating to assess the ability of several chemical moieties to direct distribution and uptake of nucleic acid cargo to specific cell-types within the central nervous system, including neurons, glia and astrocytes. As part of the collaboration, nLife is developing conjugates of small molecules and oligonucleotides that direct the delivery to specific cells in a selective manner. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to fund certain research activities being conducted by nLife and have the option to license nLife’s technology for development and commercialization across our portfolio. 
 Manufacturing 
 To provide internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities and increase control and visibility of our drug product supply chain, we signed a lease in September 2016 for a manufacturing facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, MA. This new facility supplements our existing Cambridge, MA headquarters, secures availability of drug product for current and future development activities, and potentially provides commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. The new facility will also provide additional laboratory and office space to support our anticipated growth. We plan to occupy the facility by the end of the second quarter in 2017. 
 We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party contract manufacturers and our internal GLP manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and early-stage commercial needs. We believe that the addition of our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities, together with the supply capacity we have established externally will be sufficient to meet our anticipated manufacturing needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our contract manufactures and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity should the need arise. We also believe that our products can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs.  
 Research and Development 
 Since commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development activities, including the development of our core platform technology and our therapeutic programs. We incurred research and development expenses of $40.8 million, $9.1 million and $2.4 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our therapeutic programs.

Future Filings 
 
We maintain a thoughtful and ambitious program for developing and protecting additional intellectual property, including new synthetic methodologies and reagents. We also intend to prepare and submit patent filings specifically directed to protecting individual product candidates and their uses as we finalize leads and collect relevant data, which is expected to include comparison data confirming novel and/or beneficial attributes of our product candidates. 
Singapore Intellectual Property Law 
 
Section 34 of the Singapore Patents Act provides that a person residing in Singapore is required to obtain written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents before filing an application for a patent for an invention outside of Singapore, unless all of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the person has filed an application for a patent for the same invention in the Singapore Registry of Patents at least two months before the filing of the patent application outside Singapore, and (b) the Singapore Registrar of Patents has not, in respect of this patent application, given directions to prohibit or restrict the publication of information contained in the patent application or its communication to any persons or description of persons pursuant to Section 33 of the Singapore Patents Act, or if the Singapore Registrar of Patents has given any such directions, all such directions have been revoked. A violation of Section 34 is a criminal offense punishable by a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. There have been some instances where we have undertaken filings outside of Singapore without first obtaining written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents. When this has happened in the past, we have notified the Registrar and the Registrar has offered a compound of the offences against payment of a sum of S$50 in each of these cases. Under Singapore law, the Registrar has discretion to offer a compound of such offences against payment of a sum of money of up to S$2,000.

Competition 
 The pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics, scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on nucleic acid therapeutics, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Huntington’s Disease 
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of Huntington’s disease. We believe, based on publicly available information, that Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Roche (Phase 1/2) and Sangamo Biosciences (preclinical) are developing therapies that directly target the huntingtin RNA and that uniQure (preclinical) and Voyager (preclinical) are developing an AAV-delivered gene therapy. A number of other companies are developing drugs to treat symptoms associated with Huntington’s disease, including Auspex Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (which have submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”), to the FDA), Prana Biotechnology (Phase 2), Siena Biotech (Phase 2), Raptor Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Omeros Corporation (Phase 2), Pfizer (Phase 2) and Ipsen (Phase 2), among others. 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 (eteplirsen), an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD in the United States in September 2016. The FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. No clinical benefit of Exondys 51 has been established. Thus, in accordance with the U.S. accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is requiring Sarepta to conduct a clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study is designed to assess whether Exondys 51 improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA could initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug.  
 In addition, we believe, based on publicly available information, that a number of other companies, including Summit Therapeutics (Phase 2) and Catabasis (Phase 2), are developing drugs that can alter the progression of the disease in patients. For PTC Therapeutics, conditional market authorization has been granted in Europe for TRANSLARNA (ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients who are 5 years or older. In March 2017, the FDA acknowledged the filing over protest of PTC’s NDA for TRANSLARNA. FDA granted standard review and assigned a PDUFA date of October 24, 2017.  BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s drisapersen is an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD for which the FDA issued a complete response letter in January 2016 indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the NDA was not ready for approval in its present form.  
 In addition, symptomatic treatments for DMD include corticosteroids and physical and respiratory therapy in DMD patients to slow the decline in muscle strength and to prolong ambulation and respiratory function. In February 2017, the FDA approved Emflaza (deflazacort), the first coticosteriod for the treatment of DMD, in the United States. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, 
 26

a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new molecular or chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice regulations and other requirements (“GLPs”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish safety and substantial evidence of effectiveness of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | thorough characterization of the product candidate and establishment of acceptable standards to assure its purity, identity, strength, quality, and stability in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with cGMPs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of a clinical trial site(s) or contract research organization responsible for conduct of key clinical trials in accordance with GCP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”), which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The manufacturing development, preclinical and clinical testing, and review process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Manufacturing development includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, development of manufacturing and control procedures, evaluation of stability, and the establishment of procedures to ensure continued product quality.
 Preclinical tests include animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product candidate, as well as other important aspects of drug pharmacology. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Preclinical testing will often continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve all outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, or if changes are made in trial design. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an independent IRB at each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must perform an ongoing review of the research on an annual basis until the trial is completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trials are not being conducted in accordance with GCPs, and an IRB may also suspend a clinical trial at its site for similar reasons. 
 27

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website clinicaltrials.gov, key parameters of a clinical trial. For purposes of an NDA submission, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, generally at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for approval of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as programs to communicate risk outside of labeling, prescribing restrictions, or certain restrictions on distribution and use. 
 Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. Any resubmitted application is also subject to 60-day review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the PDUFA the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review for an NDA for a new molecular entity (“NME”) has a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe from FDA filing of the application. A Priority Review designation is given to products intended for serious conditions that provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, such as providing a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review for an NME NDA is six months from filing. 
 The review process may be extended by the FDA by 3 months from the goal date to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the clinical sites where pivotal trials were conducted in order to ensure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the study data.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”), to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 28

The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk- management mechanisms, such as a Boxed Warning, which highlights a serious safety concern that should be mitigated under a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company is generally required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to safety surveillance and adverse event reporting, periodic reporting, continued cGMP compliance and quality oversight, compliance with post-marketing commitments, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, and reporting manufacturing and labeling changes, as applicable. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for assessment of compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction, and sometimes notification of, any deviations from cGMP.  These regulations impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unlisted severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as noncompliance with cGMP or failure to correct previously identified inspection findings, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | issuance of field alerts, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials using the product or other products manufactured at the same facility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may generally prescribe a drug for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote the drug in accordance with the data provided in the approved product label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted false and misleading information about the product may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 The FDA has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA may consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval, or at a later date should significant new risk information come to light. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary to assure the benefits of use of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, often at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 29

Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will have an orphan-exclusive approval and be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be the same drug as a competitor’s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor’s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless our product is demonstrated to be clinically superior to the competitor’s drug. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other countries in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 30

Healthcare Reform 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. We continue to evaluate the effect that ACA has or any potential changes to the ACA could have on our business. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. These and other potential legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. ACA, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues.  
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Limited third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture commercial products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, disgorgement of profits, and other civil and criminal penalties. 
Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 96 full-time employees. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Management considers relations with our employees to be good.
