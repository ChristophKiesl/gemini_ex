ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Retail Properties of America, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates high quality, strategically located open-air shopping centers, including properties with a mixed-use component. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 104 retail operating properties in the United States representing 19,972,000 square feet of gross leasable area (GLA) and had three active expansion and redevelopment projects. Our retail operating portfolio includes (i) neighborhood and community centers, (ii) power centers, and (iii) lifestyle centers and multi-tenant retail-focused mixed-use properties, as well as single-user retail properties.
The following table summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2019:

Operating History
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2003 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements since 2003. We were initially formed as Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. and on March 8, 2012, we changed our name to Retail Properties of America, Inc.
Business Objectives and Strategies
In 2012, we adopted a strategic plan to transform our portfolio, through asset sales and strategic acquisitions, to focus on high quality, multi-tenant retail properties located in targeted markets where demographic trends and expanding employment would result in long-term, structural earnings growth. We completed this transformation and are now a prominent owner of multi-tenant retail properties, many with a mixed-use component, primarily located in the following markets: Dallas, Washington, D.C./Baltimore, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix and Austin.

As a result of these efforts, our portfolio is better focused in markets with improved growth prospects, which we believe will translate into durable earnings growth. Since our inaugural investor day in June 2013, we have (i) improved our retail annualized base rent (ABR) by 35% to $19.52 per square foot as of December 31, 2019 from $14.46 per square foot as of March 31, 2013, (ii) increased our concentration in lifestyle and mixed-use properties based on multi-tenant retail ABR by 1,900 basis points to 35% as of December 31, 2019 from 16% as of March 31, 2013, (iii) reduced our top 20 retail tenant concentration of total ABR by 1,160 basis points to 26.3% as of December 31, 2019 from 37.9% as of March 31, 2013, and (iv) reduced our indebtedness by 37% to $1,632,904 as of December 31, 2019 from $2,601,912 as of March 31, 2013. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 87.7% of our multi-tenant retail ABR was generated in the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), as determined by the United States Census Bureau and ranked based on the most recently available population estimates.
We are primarily focused on growing our portfolio organically through (i) accretive leasing activity and (ii) mixed-use expansion and redevelopment projects. During 2019, we recorded a series of accomplishments in each of these primary areas of focus.
Our 2019 leasing activity was accretive as we signed 498 new and renewal leases across 3,255,000 square feet of GLA for a blended comparable re-leasing spread of 8.1%, achieving positive comparable cash leasing spreads of 19.7% on signed new leases and 5.3% on signed renewal leases. This 2019 signed leasing activity represents approximately 16% of our portfolio GLA, just shy of our record high of approximately 17% achieved in 2018. These signings helped us achieve record highs in a number of leasing, occupancy and ABR statistics as of December 31, 2019, including (i) retail portfolio occupancy of 95.2%, (ii) retail portfolio percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced, of 96.2%, (iii) retail anchor tenant occupancy of 97.6% and (iv) retail anchor tenant percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced, of 98.8%, as well as retail portfolio ABR per occupied square foot of $19.52. During 2019, we also achieved average annual contractual rent increases on signed new leases of approximately 180 basis points.
Our active and near-term expansion and redevelopment projects consist of approximately $372,000 to $407,000 of expected investment through 2022, equivalent to approximately 12% of the net book value of our investment properties as of December 31, 2019. These predominantly mixed use-focused projects include the redevelopments at Circle East and phase one at Carillon, the expansion projects of Pads G & H at One Loudoun Downtown and site and building reconfiguration at The Shoppes at Quarterfield as well as the vacant pad development at Southlake Town Square. Our current portfolio of assets contains numerous additional projects in the longer-term pipeline, including, among others, future phases at Carillon, additional pad developments at One Loudoun Downtown, pad developments and expansions at Main Street Promenade and Downtown Crown, and future projects at Merrifield Town Center, Tysons Corner, Southlake Town Square, Lakewood Towne Center and One Loudoun Uptown.
During 2019, we invested $29,470 in our expansion and redevelopment projects and recorded several milestones. We placed the redevelopment of the multi-family rental units at Plaza del Lago, our first multi-family rental redevelopment, in service. At Carillon, we executed a joint venture agreement for the medical office building component at phase one of the project and completed demolition work on approximately 290,000 square feet of vacant retail GLA. We also broke ground on Pads G & H at One Loudoun Downtown. Lastly, we signed our first lease at the Circle East redevelopment with a prominent fast casual restaurant operator.
Competition
In seeking new investment opportunities, we compete with other real estate investors, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, private equity funds, private individuals and other real estate companies.
From an operational perspective, we compete with other property owners on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, location, visibility, quality and aesthetic value of construction, and strength and name recognition of tenants. These factors combine to determine the level of occupancy and rental rates that we are able to achieve at our properties. Because our revenue potential is linked to the success of retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our retail tenants experience when trying to attract customers. These factors include other forms of retailing, including e-commerce and direct consumer sales, and general competition from other shopping centers. To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include:

• | local consumer demographics;


• | quality, design and location of properties;


• | diversity and perceived quality of retailers within individual shopping centers;


• | management and operational expertise of the landlord; and


• | rental rates.

Based on these factors, we believe that the size and scope of our property portfolio and operating platform, as well as the overall quality and attractiveness of our individual properties, enable us to compete effectively for retail tenants. We believe that our geographically focused strategy enhances our ability to drive revenue growth by more thoroughly understanding the local market dynamics and by increasing our market relevancy.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have one wholly owned consolidated subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is taxed on its net income at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. The income tax expense incurred through the TRS has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Regulation
General
The properties in our portfolio, including common areas, are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to allow access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our existing properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur significant capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding compliance with the ADA.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several.
Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments or similar environmental audits for all of our investment properties. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a written report that identifies existing or potential environmental conditions associated with a particular property. These environmental site assessments generally involve a review of records and visual inspection of the property, but do not include soil sampling or ground water analysis. These environmental site assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding environmental matters.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance coverage inclusive of fire, extended coverage, earthquakes, terrorism and loss of income insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We believe that the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. Terrorism insurance is carried on all properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. The terrorism insurance is 
subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances, pollutants, contaminants and biological and chemical weapons. Insurance coverage is not provided for losses attributable to riots or certain acts of God.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 215 employees.
