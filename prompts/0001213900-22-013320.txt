ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview



Hometown International, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated on May 19, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is the originator of a new Delicatessen concept. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC (“Your Hometown Deli”), we operate a delicatessen store that features “home-style” sandwiches and other entrees in a casual and friendly atmosphere. The store is designed to offer local patrons of all ages with a comfortable community gathering places. Targeted towards smaller towns and communities, the Company’s first unit was built in Paulsboro, New Jersey.



On January 18, 2014, Your Hometown Deli was formed under the laws of State of New Jersey. On May 29, 2014, Your Hometown Deli entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with the Company and, as a result, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.



We introduced our delicatessen concept under the Your Hometown Deli brand name. The Your Hometown Deli model features “home-style” sandwiches, food items, and groceries, in a casual and friendly atmosphere. The plan is for all Your Hometown Delis to be designed to be comfortable community gathering places for customers of all ages. The Company seeks to create an establishment that will appeal to local residents and commuting workers, conveniently offering high-quality products at fair prices. To date, the Company’s first and only location was opened in Paulsboro, New Jersey on October 14, 2015. We began generating revenue from the sales of our food and beverage since our soft opening in mid-October 2015.



During the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to refine our menu and operating hours. We have limited our advertising, mainly using social media and direct mailing to residents in towns around our store. We have incurred losses in the development of our business and expect our losses to continue during 2022.



Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our board of directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.



We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.



The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is a business analyst. Therefore, it is anticipated that outside consultants or advisors may be utilized to assist us in the search for and analysis of qualified target companies.



The Company has identified a potential target company and is currently engaged in discussions regarding a possible business combination. The consummation of the transaction is contingent upon the parties entering into definitive agreements and satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in those agreements, and other conditions, including, but not limited to, satisfactory completion by the Company and the target of all necessary business and legal due diligence. There is no assurance that the Company will consummate a transaction with this potential target company, or successfully identify and evaluate other suitable business opportunities, or that the Company will conclude a business combination at all.



Following any business combination we consummate our management will continue to evaluate and determine the viability of our existing delicatessen business currently operated through Your Hometown Deli.

Recent Developments



Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company



We were forced to temporarily close our delicatessen located in Paulsboro, New Jersey, due to the stay-at-home order issued by the Governor of New Jersey on March 9, 2020, resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19. The delicatessen was re-opened on September 8, 2020, with a “soft opening” to a limited audience, prior to its “Grand Re-Opening” to the public on September 22, 2020. The effects of COVID-19 continued to have a material impact on our business during 2021 by hindering staff availability, limiting the flow of customers into our delicatessen, and restricting our supply chain. Although we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact, it is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business in 2022.
Corporate Developments 



The delicatessen was temporarily closed, beginning on August 1, 2021, while we changed management of Your Hometown Deli and hired a new operations manager for the store in Paulsboro, New Jersey. The delicatessen reopened on September 11, 2021, with increased staff and expanded hours.
The Your Hometown Deli Concept



Your Hometown Deli is a delicatessen concept that focuses on providing high-quality food products not available in local supermarkets or take-out restaurants. The delicatessen concept has a worldwide history with the term first appearing in the English language in 1889. The word “delicatessen” originates in the German language and means “delicacies” or “fine foods.” Delicatessens vary throughout the world, but, in the United States, a delicatessen (or “deli”) is a small retail store that is a blend of a grocery and a fast-food restaurant.



Our Your Hometown Deli concept is patterned after traditional delicatessens, offering a wider and fresher menu than found at fast-food restaurants. Sandwiches and green salads are made fresh to order. Like many delis, Your Hometown Deli also serves some hot foods kept on a steam table, similar to a cafeteria. In addition to ready-to-eat food, the Your Hometown Deli sells cold cuts by weight. A wide variety of beverages are also sold together with potato chips and similar products.



In addition to our food offerings, beverages, ice cream, small snack items, such as candy, cookies and chewing gums, are available for purchase. Your Hometown Deli also provides take-out service, online purchases, and delivery service via Grubhub.com, and limited seating in the store.



We began generating revenue from the sales of our food and beverage since our soft opening in mid-October 2015. We have had minimal revenues as of the date of this annual report, which we have used to fund our operating activities.



Products 



Your Hometown Deli provides sandwiches, soups, salads, deli meats and cheeses, hot and cold drinks, fresh breads and rolls. Salads include made-to-order green salads, and prepared pasta, potato, chicken, or other variety of “wet” salads. Fresh coffee, tea and other hot and cold beverages are also available for purchase. 
Strategy



The Company’s business strategy is to create a food-centered social environment within the local community that offers higher-quality prepared food and ingredients than is typically found locally. The Company’s management believes that broader market trends and certain locality-specific attributes support this strategy. According to the United States Department of Labor, the average American eats out 4-5 times a week. Management of the Company believes the increased popularity of eating out in the United States is a social trend that is likely to continue in the future.

Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan to expand our delicatessen concept into other locations and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to us.  If we cannot obtain financing, or if we determine not to proceed with our business plan, we may decide to exit our existing business and explore potential strategic alternatives, including establishing a new business, or target an existing business for acquisition, without restriction to any specific business, industry or geographical location.



We may also expand our business by combining with private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. The Company has identified a potential target company and is currently engaged in discussions regarding a possible business combination involving the two companies. The consummation of the transaction is contingent upon the parties entering into definitive agreements and satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in those agreements, and other conditions, including, but not limited to, satisfactory completion by the Company and the target of all necessary business and legal due diligence. There is no assurance that the Company will consummate a transaction with this potential target company, or successfully identify and evaluate other suitable business opportunities, or that the Company will conclude a business combination at all.



Location



The Company’s sole location is in Paulsboro, a borough in Gloucester County, New Jersey, that was founded in 1904. Paulsboro is located directly across the Delaware River from the city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia airport. Your Hometown Deli is located on a property in the commercial area of downtown Paulsboro that has two buildings. The front building is the location of the Your Hometown Deli, as well as the local Rutgers University’s School of Public Health offices that are conducting a research study. The rear building is used throughout the week as a practice facility by the local wrestling club and other sports groups.



The borough of Paulsboro is undergoing a redevelopment phase from a petroleum products specialty port into an adaptable “OmniPort” able to handle a diversity of bulk, break bulk cargo and shipping containers. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that the port is well suited to become a center for the manufacturing, assembly, and transport of wind turbines and platforms for the development of Atlantic Wind Connection. The port is located approximately one mile from the site of the Your Hometown Deli. The Company’s management believes that hundreds of employees around the area will eventually pass the Your Hometown Deli, the only food establishment on the main commuter route to the Port.



The Market



The local Paulsboro market is small, but conducive to hosting a Your Hometown Deli. According to the NJ Gazetteer, there were 5862 people and 2198 households residing in the borough as of July 1, 2020. The median household income was $44,250.  The broader Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area is the eight-largest metropolitan area in the United States with a population to 6.1 million people.



The Company’s customers are mainly people living in Paulsboro and the adjacent communities of Greenwich, Clarksboro and West Deptford, New Jersey. Commuting workers also make up a large number of our delicatessen’s customers.



Local students and coaches who frequently use the sports practice facility on the property continue to be another group of customers. The practice facility is also home to the “The Monster Factory,” a professional wrestling training and wrestling match promotions organization. In business more than 30 years, the Monster Factory has become “the world’s most famous wrestling school” and has been featured in the Rolling Stone, NewsWeek, and Wall Street Journal. Attendees of The Monster Factory wrestling events are becoming more consistent customers for Your Hometown Deli.



Local competing delicatessen concept stores include Wawa and Royal Farms. Other dining and grocery options in the area include locally owned pizzerias, seafood, and fine dining restaurants. Fast food options in the vicinity include McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Grocery stores include Dollar General, Heritage’s Dairy Stores and Save A Lot.
