Item 1. | Business

Overview
Farmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “Farmer Bros.”), is a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products. We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products. With a robust product line, including organic, Direct Trade, Direct Trade Verified Sustainable coffees or DTVS and other sustainably-produced coffees, iced and hot teas, cappuccino, spices, and baking/biscuit mixes, among others, we offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value-added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. We operate in one business segment.
Corporate Relocation
In fiscal 2015 we began the process of relocating our corporate headquarters, product development lab, and manufacturing and distribution operations from Torrance, California to a new facility housing these operations in Northlake, Texas (the “New Facility”) (the “Corporate Relocation Plan”). In order to focus on our core product offerings, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold certain assets associated with our manufacture, processing and distribution of raw, processed and blended spices and certain other culinary products (collectively, the “Spice Assets”) to Harris Spice Company Inc. (“Harris”). In fiscal 2017, we completed the construction of, and exercised the purchase option to acquire, the New Facility, relocated our Torrance operations to the New Facility, and sold our facility in Torrance, California (the “Torrance Facility”). We commenced distribution activities at the New Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and initial production activities late in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We completed the Corporate Relocation Plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We began roasting coffee in the New Facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Recent Developments
Acquisitions
In fiscal 2017, we completed two acquisitions. On October 11, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of China Mist Brands, Inc. dba China Mist Tea Company (“China Mist”), a provider of flavored iced teas and iced green teas, and on February 7, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of West Coast Coffee Company, Inc. (“West Coast Coffee”), a coffee roaster and distributor with a focus on the convenience store, grocery and foodservice channels. The China Mist acquisition is expected to extend our tea product offerings and give us a greater presence in the high-growth premium tea industry, while the West Coast Coffee acquisition is expected to broaden our reach in the Northwestern United States.
On August 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Boyd Coffee Company (“Boyd’s”), a privately-held coffee roaster and distributor with a focus on restaurants, hotels and convenience stores on the West Coast of the United States, with a combination of cash and stock. Boyd’s business model is expected to be complementary to the Company across customer channels, product portfolios and distribution networks, including a high-touch service model of direct-store-delivery. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, subject to certain closing conditions.
DSD Restructuring Plan
As a result of an ongoing operational review of various initiatives within our direct-store-delivery or DSD selling organization, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced a restructuring plan to reorganize our DSD operations in an effort to realign functions into a channel-based selling organization, streamline operations, acquire certain channel specific expertise, and improve selling effectiveness and financial results (the “DSD Restructuring Plan”).

Business Strategy
Overview
We develop great tasting products delivered with concierge service with the goal of a positive impact on our customers and the planet. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also insist on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible.
In order to achieve our mission, we have had to grow existing capabilities and develop new ones over the years. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following:

• | develop new products in response to demographic and other trends to better compete in areas such as premium coffees and teas;


• | grow through acquisitions to broaden our geographic reach and to increase our presence in the high-growth premium tea industry;


• | implement a channel-based selling strategy to better address the unique needs of each customer channel, more quickly respond to industry trends, and improve sales growth while maintaining the value-add provided by the DSD delivery and service model;


• | rethink aspects of our Company culture to improve productivity and employee engagement and to attract and retain talent;


• | embrace sustainability across our operations, in the quality of our products, as well as, how we treat our coffee growers; and

2


• | ensure our systems and processes provide the highest quality products at a competitive cost, protection against cyber threats, and a safe environment for our employees and partners.

We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through our product offerings and through our customer service model, with quality and sustainability as the underpinning, which includes:

• | a wide variety of coffee product offerings and packaging options across numerous brands and three quality tiers-value, premium and specialty;


• | consumer-branded coffee and tea products;


• | beverage equipment placement and service;


• | hassle-free inventory and product procurement management;


• | DSD service;


• | merchandising support;


• | product and menu insights; and


• | a robust approach to social, environmental and economic sustainability throughout our business.

Our services provided to DSD customers are conducted primarily in person through Route Sales Representatives, or RSRs, who develop personal relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations. We also provide comprehensive coffee programs to our national account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing and supply chain management. Through China Mist Tea-Loving Care®, we offer our customers an iced tea service that includes a diverse offering of on-trend products, brewing equipment expertly calibrated for extracting optimal flavor from our tea blends, specialized distribution, training and incentives, professional service, quality assurance, and strategic marketing support. 
We distribute our owned brands primarily through our DSD network, and, in some cases, through third-party distributors, while continuing to support and grow our private label and other national account business. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our website and China Mist's website, respectively, and sell certain products such as Un Momento®, Collaborative Coffee™, Cain's™ and McGarvey® coffees and China Mist® teas at retail. 
Strategic Initiatives
We are focused on the following strategies to reduce costs, streamline our supply chain, expand the breadth of products and services we provide to our customers, broaden our geographic reach, increase our presence in high growth industries and product categories, and better position the Company to attract new customers:
Reduce Costs to Compete More Effectively

• | New Facility. In fiscal 2017, we completed construction of and relocation to our state-of-the-art facility in Northlake, Texas. We undertook this endeavor, in part, to pursue improved production efficiency to allow us to provide a more cost-competitive offering of high-quality products. We believe the ongoing improvements in production efficiency will allow us to operate at a lower cost, generally.


• | DSD Restructuring Plan. As a result of an ongoing operational review of various initiatives within our DSD selling organization, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced the DSD Restructuring Plan to reorganize our DSD operations in an effort to realign functions into a channel-based selling organization, streamline operations, acquire certain channel specific expertise, and improve selling effectiveness and financial results. We began recognizing cost benefits associated with the restructuring in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and we anticipate annualized savings from the restructuring plan beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect to complete the DSD Restructuring Plan by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We continue to analyze our DSD organization and evaluate other potential restructuring opportunities in light of our strategic priorities.


• | Third-Party Logistics. During the second half of fiscal 2016, we replaced our long-haul fleet operations with third-party logistics (“3PL“). In fiscal 2017, we experienced a reduction in our fuel consumption and empty

3

trailer miles, while improving our intermodal and trailer cube utilization as compared to the prior fiscal year. Aligning with our 3PL partner has allowed us to more efficiently manage routing thereby reducing diesel pollution in support of our sustainability efforts. Dynamic routing is expected to allow for further reduction of our carbon emissions in fiscal 2018.

• | Vendor Managed Inventory. During the second half of fiscal 2016, we entered into a third-party vendor managed inventory arrangement. The use of vendor managed inventory arrangements has begun to yield benefits in fiscal 2017 by enabling us to reconfigure our packaging methodology, eliminating duplication but resulting in the same strength packaging with less material, thereby reducing waste and contributing to our sustainability efforts.


• | Warehouse Management. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide warehouse management services for our New Facility. We expect the warehouse management services to facilitate cost savings by leveraging the third party's expertise in opening new facilities, implementing lean management practices, improving performance on certain key performance metrics, and standardizing best practices. 

Optimize Sales, Pricing and Portfolio of Products

• | Pricing and Products. In fiscal 2016, we built capability to more strategically optimize our pricing strategy across product, channel, customer and geographic segments, which we continued in fiscal 2017. This process is designed to improve our average margins as well as retention rates. In addition, in fiscal 2017, we continued our prior work optimizing SKU count and identifying opportunities to consolidate suppliers to improve costs and supply chain efficiency.


• | Channel-Based Selling Organization. Changing from a geographic to a channel-based selling strategy as part of the DSD Restructuring Plan is expected to allow us to better serve our customers and improve sales growth while maintaining the value-add provided by the DSD delivery and service model. We believe this new, channel-based sales strategy will empower our sales organization to better address the unique needs of each customer channel thereby deepening our customer relationships, allow us to create a more comprehensive customer support structure, enhance our marketing efforts, and allow us to respond more quickly to industry trends.

Strategic Investment in Assets and Evaluation of Cost Structure

• | Acquisitions. One of our investment priorities is exploring acquisitions that we believe will enhance long-term stockholder value and complement or enhance our product, equipment, service and/or distribution offerings to existing and new customer bases. For example, in fiscal 2017, we completed the China Mist acquisition to extend our tea product offerings and give us a greater presence in the high-growth premium tea industry, and the West Coast Coffee acquisition to broaden our reach in the Northwestern United States. Additionally, on August 18, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire Boyd Coffee Company. The Boyd Coffee Company acquisition is expected to add to our product portfolio, improve our growth potential, broaden our distribution footprint with a deeper penetration on the West Coast of the United States, and increase our capacity utilization at our production facilities. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. See Note 3, Acquisitions, and Note 26, Subsequent Events—Boyd’s Purchase Agreement, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 


• | Asset Utilization. We continue to look for ways to deploy our personnel, systems, assets and infrastructure to create or enhance stockholder value. Areas of focus have included corporate staffing and structure, methods of procurement, logistics, inventory management, supporting technology, and real estate assets.


• | Branch Consolidation and Property Sales. In an effort to streamline our branch operations, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold two Northern California branch properties, with a third Northern California property under contract for sale, and we acquired a new branch facility in Hayward, California. The third Northern California property was sold in fiscal 2017. We evaluate our branch operation structure on an ongoing basis to identify opportunities to streamline the supply chain and reduce costs.

Corporate Capabilities and Alignment to Create Stockholder Value

• | Investment in Human Resources. In February 2017, we hired David G. Robson as our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Ellen D. Iobst as our Chief Operations Officer. We also promoted Scott Siers to our

4

executive management team as Senior Vice President and General Manager—Direct Ship. Each of these individuals brings a proven track record of strategic and operational leadership capabilities in finance and/or manufacturing operations at large consumer goods organizations.

• | Commitment to Employee Wellness. We are committed to creating a healthier and happier workforce which we believe contributes to our success. We have received certifications as a Fit-Friendly Worksite and a Blue Zone Workplace based on the activities and environment created in our workplace to support healthy living and promote wellness of our associates.


• | Employee Development. We have invested in a Learning Management System to enable training facilitation and tracking of training modules to support the development of employees at all levels and functions within the organization. We recently completed a Talent Planning Process of all exempt level employees across the organization. We calibrated the assessment of talent and created succession charts for all critical roles to ensure we have the right talent and capabilities to support the business today and in the future. 

Performance Driven Culture

• | In fiscal 2017, we continued to emphasize greater alignment of employee individual goals with Company goals under our compensation plans in order to focus the entire organization on the effort to create value for our stockholders.

Drive High-Growth Product Categories and Address Broader Customer Needs

• | Introduction of Collaborative Coffee™ and Redesign of Un Momento®Branded Retail Products. In an effort to address what we believe to be unmet consumer needs and improve margin within the retail grocery environment, in fiscal 2016 we launched the Collaborative Coffee™ brand into the retail grocery channel and completed a packaging redesign and product portfolio optimization of our Un Momento® retail branded product line. Collaborative Coffee™ offers coffee enthusiasts a super-premium, verified direct trade coffee at an approachable price. Un Momento® delivers Millennial Hispanic consumers appealing flavor variety and premium coffee at an exceptional value.


• | Growth in Premium Tea Industry. In fiscal 2017, we increased our presence in the high-growth premium tea industry through the China Mist acquisition. In fiscal 2017, we introduced a new retail line of China Mist naturally flavored iced teas which are naturally gluten-free and blended with all-natural flavorings, and a new line of Artisan hot teas.


• | Product Development Lab. In fiscal 2017, we opened our product development lab at the New Facility where we are focused on developing innovative products in response to industry trends and customer needs. In fiscal 2017, we developed new products including Artisan Cold Brew Coffee and Artisan Direct Trade Coffee.


• | SQF Certification. We are committed to the highest standards in food quality and safety. We have obtained the Safety Quality Food (“SQF”) certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative in our Portland and Houston facilities and are in the process of obtaining the SQF certification for the New Facility.

Expand Sustainability Leadership

• | Sustainability. We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee and tea programs that can include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and packaging material reductions. During fiscal 2017, we submitted our third third-party verified Carbon Disclosure Project survey for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (direct emissions, indirect emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam and other indirect emissions). Further, we published sustainability reports based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s core compliance standard in fiscal 2017 and 2016 relating to our fiscal 2016 and 2015 operations, respectively. In addition, China Mist is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (the “ETP”), a non-profit organization that works to improve the sustainability of the tea sector, the lives of tea

5

workers and farmers, and the environment in which tea is produced. As a member of the ETP, China Mist sources all its tea from tea plantations that are certified, monitored, and regularly audited by the ETP.

• | LEED® Certified Facilities. Our Portland production and distribution facility was one of the first in the Northwest to achieve LEED® Silver Certification. We anticipate that our corporate offices at the New Facility will also be LEED® certified.


• | Expansion of DTVS Program. In fiscal 2017, we completed our second third-party audit and verification of our DTVS program for sourcing green coffee. DTVS is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is DTVS, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework. The outcome of this evaluation weighs on where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us. DTVS represents a growing part of our coffee portfolio.


• | Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, in fiscal 2017 we began tracking traceability levels from all green coffee suppliers on a per contract basis.


• | Supplier Sustainability. We are committed to working with suppliers who share our social, environmental and economic sustainability goals. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when suppliers are not held to the same strict standards to which we hold ourselves. To address this concern, in fiscal 2017, we surveyed all green coffee suppliers along with our top non-raw coffee suppliers to assess their social, environmental, and economic sustainability practices and alignment with the United Nations Global Compact, a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies. 

Charitable Activities
We view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model: Social, Environmental, and Economic Development, or SEED. We endorse and support communities where our customers, employees, businesses, and suppliers are located, and who have enthusiastically supported us over the past 100 years. Our objective is to provide support toward a mission of supply chain stability with a focus on food security.
Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure that families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions).

• | Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks.


• | We support industry organizations such as World Coffee Research, which commits to grow, protect, and enhance supplies of quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of the families who produce it, and the Specialty Coffee Association (“SCA”) Sustainability Council and the Coalition for Coffee Communities, which are focused on sustainability in coffee growing regions.


• | Our employee-driven CAFÉ Crew organizes employee involvement at local charities and fund raisers, including running in the Chicago Marathon in support of Team Ronald McDonald House, riding in the Ride Against Hunger supported by Tarrant Area Food Bank, supporting delivery for Meals on Wheels, and hosting local food drives.


• | All of our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to fully eliminate edible food waste from the landfill.

Industry and Market Leadership
We have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee and tea knowledge to grow our business:
6


• | Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation and/or leadership positions with the SCA, National Coffee Association, Coalition for Coffee Communities, International Women's Coffee Alliance, International Foodservice Manufacturers Association, Pacific Coast Coffee Association, Roasters Guild and World Coffee Research, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. We were among the first coffee roasters in the nation to receive SCA certification of a state-of-the-art coffee lab and operate Public Domain®, a specialty coffeehouse in Portland, Oregon. We plan to submit our product development lab at the New Facility for SCA certification.


• | Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have developed a market insight capability internally that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee and tea industries. We provide trend insights that help our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies. Within this, we are focused on understanding key demographic groups such as Millennials and Hispanics, and key channel trends.

Raw Materials and Supplies
Our primary raw material is green coffee, an agricultural commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange that is subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years, coffee “C” market price per pound ranged from approximately $1.02 to $2.22. The coffee “C” market price as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 was $1.26 and $1.46 per pound, respectively. Our principal packaging materials include cartonboard, corrugated and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities.
We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Coffee “C” market prices in fiscal 2017 traded in a 60 cent range during the year, but averaged near the historical average for the past five years. There can be no assurance that green coffee prices will remain at these levels in the future. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade, DTVS and Fair Trade Certified™ sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. Fair Trade Certified™ provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade and DTVS products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to farmers instead of through brokers in an effort to promote investment in better and more sustainable farming practices as well as to ensure a fairer price. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 8, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other proprietary rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonal influences. The winter months are generally the strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from grocery retailers ramping up inventory for the winter selling season. 
7

Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Distribution
We operate production facilities in Northlake, Texas; Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Scottsdale, Arizona. Distribution takes place out of the New Facility, the Portland, Hillsboro and Scottsdale facilities, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; and Moonachie, New Jersey. We commenced distribution activities at the New Facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and initial production activities late in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We began roasting coffee in the New Facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
Our products reach our customers primarily in two ways: through our nationwide DSD network of 450 delivery routes and 114 branch warehouses as of June 30, 2017, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. DSD sales are made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business by our RSRs who generally are responsible for soliciting, selling and collecting from and otherwise maintaining our customer accounts. Our DSD business includes office coffee services whereby we provide office coffee and tea products, including a variety of coffee brands and blends, brewing and beverage equipment, and foodservice supplies directly to offices. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our website and China Mist's website, respectively.
Customers
We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products. Although no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, we have several large national account customers, the loss of or reduction in sales to one or more of which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During fiscal 2017, our top five customers accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales. 
Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are “price” buyers, seeking the low-cost provider with little concern about service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. Historically, our product returns have not been significant.
Competition 
The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee), Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage, wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods, regional coffee roasters such as S&D Coffee & Tea (Cott Corporation) and Boyd Coffee Company, specialty coffee suppliers such as Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Rogers Family Company, Distant Lands Coffee, Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and retail brand beverage manufacturers. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam’s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages.
We believe our longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution network, industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition.

Working Capital
We finance our operations internally and through borrowings under our existing credit facility. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see Results of Operations and Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition included in Part II, Item 7 of this report and Note 19, Other Current Liabilities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period during the winter months, which we typically finance with cash flows from operations. In anticipation of our peak sales period, we typically increase inventory in the first quarter of the fiscal year. We use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning to determine appropriate inventory levels for seasonal demand. 
Regulatory Environment
The conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Employees
On June 30, 2017, we employed approximately 1,610 employees, 442 of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 
Other
The nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.
