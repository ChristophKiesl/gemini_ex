Ponce Bank
 Ponce Bank is a federally-chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. Ponce Bank was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” In 2017, the Bank adopted its current name. The Bank is designated as a Minority Depository Institution and a Community Development Financial Institution under applicable regulations and is a certified Small Business Administration lender.
 The Bank’s business is conducted through its administrative office and 13 branch banking offices. The banking offices are located in Bronx (4 branches), Manhattan (2 branches), Queens (3 branches) and Brooklyn (3 branches), New York, and Union City (1 branch), New Jersey.
 1


The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, construction and land, and in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, as well as, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts.
 
Mortgage World Bankers, Inc.
 On July 10, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World. Mortgage World is a mortgage banking entity subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World is the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. Although Mortgage World is permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operates in the New York City metropolitan area.
Market Area
 The Bank is headquartered in the Bronx, New York, with a primary market in the other boroughs of New York City (excluding Staten Island) and Hudson County, New Jersey. Mortgage World is headquartered in Astoria, Queens, with a primary market area in the New York City metropolitan area. The size and complex nature of the geographic footprint makes for diverse demographics that continue to undergo significant changes, in terms of economic, racial, ethnic and age parameters, all with potentially substantial long-term institutional ramifications. 
 The Bank’s primary deposit base includes a large and stable base of locally employed blue-collar workers with low-to-medium income, middle-aged, and with limited investment funds. Within the base of locally employed blue-collar workers there is a significant, and growing, portion of recently immigrated, younger, lower-skilled laborers. The influx of immigrant lower-skilled workers, however, has been hampered by the increases in rental rates in the rental housing market within the New York City metropolitan area. 
 Another significant customer segment of the Bank consists of middle aged and older white-collar, high-income individuals, many of whom are self-employed real estate investors and developers. They constitute a large percentage of the borrowing base of the Bank and, increasingly, are becoming the source of a significant percentage of commercial deposits. 
 The Bank has historically been funded through local community deposits. Today, the Bank continues to rely primarily on community deposits from its market areas to fund investments and loans. However, the mix of community deposits now includes demand and money market funds of consumer, commercial and not-for-profit entities, with a decreasing reliance on time deposits. Additionally, the Bank has been using alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits and FHLBNY advances to support loan growth.
 Mortgage World traditionally has relied on the home purchase market as its principal source of loans for sale in the secondary market. The advent of historically low interest rates has enabled Mortgage World to successfully enter the home refinance market.
 The Bank’s market was significantly impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial economic slowdowns, leading to unemployment, closures of businesses and other hardships. The federal government response, including lowering of interest rates, Paycheck Protection Program lending, extended unemployment benefits and business assistance, provided notable economic support, leading to significant economic recovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank and Mortgage World continued to service the market area.
 Competition
 The Company faces significant competition within its market area both in originating loans and attracting deposits. There is a high concentration of financial institutions in the market area, including national, regional and other locally-operated commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and credit unions whose activities include banking as well as mortgage lending. Several “mega” banks exist in the market, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Capital One, many of whom are continuing to push for retail deposits and home mortgages. A number of the Bank’s competitors offer non-deposit products and services that the Bank does not currently offer, such as trust services, private banking, insurance services and asset management. Additionally, the Company faces an increasing level of competition from non-core financial service providers that do not necessarily maintain a physical presence in the 
 2


Bank’s market area, such as Radius Bank, Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and many internet financial service providers. The amount of competition facing the Company is extensive and can negatively impact its growth. 
 
The market share of bank deposits in the New York area can be difficult to quantify, as some “mega” banks will include large scale deposits from around the world as held at headquarters. However, in Bronx County, New York, where the Bank maintains four branches, it holds 1.72% (as of June 30, 2020) of the market’s deposits. This represents the Bank’s largest market share in a county-level area. The Bank continues to work to improve its market position by expanding its brand within its current market area, and building its capacity to provide more products and services to its customers.
 Lending Activities
 General. The Bank’s principal lending activity is originating real estate-secured loans, including one-to-four family investor-owned and owner-occupied residential, multifamily residential, nonresidential property, construction and land loans, and commercial and industrial (“C&I”) business loans and consumer loans. It originates real estate and other loans through its loan officers, marketing efforts, customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. Most recently, the Bank entered into a partnership with Grain Technologies, LLC. (“Grain”). Grain provides a line of credit using a mobile application geared nationally to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies. These loans are reflected in the consumer loan portfolio. During 2020, the Bank focused on making PPP loans within its market area, to both customers and non-customers. The Bank remains committed to assist its communities with PPP loans. Subject to market conditions and its asset-liability analysis, the Bank looks to maintain its emphasis on multifamily residential and nonresidential property loans while growing the overall loan portfolio and increasing the overall yield earned on loans. 
 Lending activities are conducted primarily by the Bank’s salaried loan officers operating at its main and branch office locations as well as remotely. It also conducts lending activities through its subsidiary Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation. All loans originated by the Bank are underwritten pursuant to its policies and procedures. The Bank currently intends that substantially all of its mortgage loan originations will have adjustable interest rates. For its non-PPP business loan originations, variable rate pricing is offered based on prime rate plus a margin. 
 Mortgage World’s lending activities consists of taking applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors. At December 31, 2020, 70 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $34.4 million were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Because of Mortgage World’s business and all of its loans are held for sale, they are not included in the discussion that follows. See Note 13, “Fair Value” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

One-to-four Family Investor-Owned Loans. At December 31, 2020, one-to-four family investor-owned loans were $319.6 million, or 27.3% of the Bank’s total loans. Investor-owned mortgage loans secured by non-owner-occupied one-to-four family residential property represent the Bank’s largest real estate lending category. The majority of the portfolio, $278.6 million, or 87.2%, are two-to-four family properties (462 accounts), while the remaining $41.0 million, or 12.8%, are primarily single family, non-owner-occupied investment properties (89 accounts). The three largest loans in this category are $4.7 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million. In this category, loans totaling $121.8 million, or 38.1%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $113.8 million, or 35.6%, in Kings County, $36.0 million, or 11.3%, in Bronx County, and $17.1 million, or 5.3%, in New York County. The rest of this category, less than 9.7%, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $8.2 million, or 2.6%. 
 The Bank imposes strict underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including lower maximum loan-to-value ratios (“LTVs”) of 70% on purchases and 65% on refinances, a required minimum debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR,” net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of 1.20x that must be met by either the property on a standalone basis or by the inclusion of the owner(s) as co-borrower(s). In addition, all such loans currently require that the transaction exhibit a global debt service coverage ratio (net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of no less than 1.0x. This coverage ratio indicates that the owner has the capacity to support the loan along with all personal obligations. On occasion, the Bank has required that the borrower establish a cash reserve to be held at the Bank in order to provide additional security. The maximum term on such loans is 30 years, typically with five-year adjustable rates. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank adopted temporary guidelines lowering LTVs by 5 percentiles and increasing DSCRs by 10 percentiles.  
 One-to-four family investor-owned real estate loans involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied real estate loans. Rather than depending on the borrower’s repayment ability from employment or other income, the borrower’s repayment ability is primarily dependent on ensuring that a tenant occupies the investor property and has the financial capacity to pay sufficient rent to cover the borrower’s debt. In addition, if an investor borrower has several loans secured by properties in the same market, the loans have risks similar to a multifamily real estate loan and repayment of those loans is subject to adverse conditions in the rental market or the local economy.

One-to-four Family Owner-occupied Loans. One-to-four family owner-occupied loans totaled $98.8 million, or 8.4% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Of the three largest loans outstanding in this category, one loan had an outstanding balance of $2.2 million and two loans had outstanding balances of $2.0 million each. There are 20 loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $1.0 million, totaling $27.1 million, or approximately 27.4% of this category. At December 31, 2020, approximately $36.1 million, or 36.6%, of this category was secured by properties located in Queens County, $15.7 million, or 15.9%, in Kings County, $9.3 million, or 9.4%, in Nassau County, $8.1 million, or 8.2%, in New York County, $7.1 million, or 7.2%, in Bronx County, and $6.2 million, or 6.3%, in Westchester County. None of the other geographical concentrations exceeded 6% of this category. 
 It is the Bank’s policy to underwrite loans secured by one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate in a manner that ensures strict compliance with Dodd-Frank regulatory requirements. This includes underwriting only mortgages that have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less. That is the highest ratio a borrower can have and still receive a qualified mortgage. A qualified mortgage is presumed to meet the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. As part of this effort, the Bank employs software that tests each loan for compliance. 
 The Bank generally limits loans in this category to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90% for a purchase and 80% for a refinance, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value. The maximum loan term is 30 years, self-amortizing. As a portfolio lender, the Bank presently does not offer a fixed-rate product. The Bank currently offers mostly 5/1 and 5/5 adjustable rate loans that adjust based on a spread ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the one or five-year FHLBNY rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may increase generally is limited to 2% for the first two adjustments and 5% for the life of the loan.
 Multifamily and Nonresidential Loans. At $307.4 million, or 26.2% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, loans secured by multifamily properties represent the Bank’s second largest lending concentration. The nonresidential portfolio accounts for $218.9 million, or 18.7% of the total loan portfolio, and represents the third largest concentration. Combined, the multifamily and nonresidential loan portfolios amount to $526.3 million, or 44.9% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. The three largest loans were $12.3 million, $10.9 million and $9.2 million, with the largest being a multifamily residential, and the other two being nonresidential. Of the total of $526.3 million in multifamily and nonresidential loans, 166 loans have balances in excess of $1.0 million and account for $376.5 million, or approximately 71.5%, of this lending concentration. In terms of geographical concentrations, $221.4 million, or 42.1%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $113.8 million, or 21.6%, in Kings County, $79.0 million, or 15.0%, in Bronx County, $33.6 million, or 6.4%, in New York County, $20.0 million, or 3.8%, in Westchester County and $15.3 million, or 2.9%, in Nassau County. All other concentrations by county, which account for 8.2% of this category, have balances of $10.0 million or less. In the nonresidential portfolio, the overall mix is diverse in terms of property types, with the largest concentration being retail and wholesale at $76.2 million, or 34.8% of the portfolio, industrial and warehouse at $49.6 million, or 22.6%, service, doctor, dentist, daycare and schools at $25.6 million, or 11.7%, offices at $20.1 million, or 9.2%, hotels and motels at $15.4 million, or 7.0%, churches at $9.8 million, or 4.5%, medical, nursing home and hospital at $9.8 million, or 4.5%, and restaurants at $9.4 million, or 4.3%. The rest of the portfolio accounts for other property types, with none exceeding 1.0% as a portfolio concentration.
 The Bank considers a number of factors when originating multifamily and nonresidential mortgages. Loans secured by multifamily and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in this type of lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the viability and cash flow potential of the property. Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be more subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as compared to residential real estate loans. To address the risks involved, the Bank evaluates the qualifications and financial resources of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value of cash flows and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Bank considers the financial resources of the borrower, the experience of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower in owning or managing similar properties and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value or purchase price of the mortgaged property (whichever is lower), and the debt service coverage ratio. All multifamily and nonresidential loans are supported by appraisals that conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy. The Bank generally limits the maximum LTVs on these loans to 75%, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the subject property (70% on the refinance of nonresidential properties such as retail spaces, office buildings, and warehouses) and a DSCR of 1.20%. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank adopted temporary guidelines lowering LTVs by 5 percentiles and increasing DSCRs by 10 percentiles. The maximum loan term ranges between 25 and 30 years. As is the Bank’s general policy, the Bank offers only adjustable rates on its multifamily and nonresidential mortgages ─ with adjustments based on a spread currently ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the five-year FHLBNY rate.

Construction and Land Loans. Construction and land loans totaled $105.9 million, or 9.0%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, (27 projects), with $94.2 million consisting of multifamily residential (22 projects). In terms of geographical concentrations, $65.9 million, or 62.3%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $33.0 million, or 31.1%, in Kings County, $5.5 million, or 5.2%, in New York County and $1.5 million, or 1.4%, in Bronx County. At December 31, 2020, loans in process related to construction loans totaled $101.1 million. 
 The Bank’s typical construction loan has a term of up to 24 months and contains: 
  
• | a minimum of 5% contingency;
--+-----------------------------


• | a minimum of 5% retainage;
--+---------------------------


• | a loan-to-cost ratio of 70% or less;
--+-------------------------------------


• | an end loan loan-to-value ratio of 65% or less;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | an interest reserve;
--+---------------------


• | guarantees of all owners / partners / shareholders of a closely held organization owning 20% or more of company stock or entity ownership; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an option to convert to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of the project.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. The Bank’s approach to the underwriting of construction loans is driven by five factors: analysis of the developer; analysis of the contractor; analysis of the project; valuation of the project; and evaluation of the source of repayment. 
 The developer’s character, capacity and capital are analyzed to determine that the individual or entity has the ability to first complete the project and then either sell it or carry permanent financing. The general contractor is analyzed for reputation, sufficient expertise and capacity to complete the project within the allotted time. The project is analyzed in order to ensure that the project will be completed within a reasonable period of time according to the plans and specifications, and can either be sold, rented or refinanced once completed. All construction loans are supported by appraisals which conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy and affirm the value of the project both “As Is” and “As Completed.” Lastly, the Bank reviews the developer’s cash flow estimations for the project on an “As Completed” basis. These projections are compared to the appraiser’s estimates. Debt service coverage using projected rental net income must be at least 1.2x the estimated debt service when operating at stabilized levels. 
 Upon closing of the construction loan, the Bank begins monitoring the project and funding requisitions for completed stages upon inspection and confirmation by third party firms, such as engineers, of the work performed and its value and quality. Conversion to permanent financing usually occurs upon a conversion underwriting and receipt of certificates of occupancy, as applicable. 
 C&I Loans and Lines of Credit. C&I loans and lines of credit represent less than 1.0% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Unlike real estate loans, which are secured by real property, and whose collateral value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. The collateral, such as accounts receivable, securing these loans may fluctuate in value. 
 Although the Bank’s loan policy allows for the extension of secured and unsecured financing, the Bank usually seeks to obtain collateral when in initial discussions with potential borrowers. Unsecured credit facilities are made only to strong borrowers that possess established track records with the Bank (or come highly recommended) and are supported by guarantors. Guarantees are required of any individual or entity owning or controlling 20% or more of the borrowing entity, with exceptions requiring approval from the Board of Directors. When credits are not secured by a specific lien on an asset, the Bank usually requires a general lien on all business assets as evidenced by a UCC filing. Pricing is typically based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a spread driven by risk-rating variables.

Underwriters are required to identify at least two sources of repayment, usually recommend that loans contain covenants, such as minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum global debt service coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, 30-day “cleanups” or “clean-downs,” as applicable, and must require periodic financial reporting. In addition, every effort is made to set up borrowers with auto-debit for loan payments and strongly encourage them to maintain operating accounts at the Bank. 
 Lines of credit are typically short-term facilities (12 months) that are provided for occasional or seasonal needs. They are extended to only qualifying borrowers who have established cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. At a minimum, a bi-annual 30-day clean-up, or 75% bi-annual pay-down period is required, although annually is preferred. A clean-up period generally is not required on amortizing secured lines. Guarantors, which are usually required, must have clean credit histories and a substantial outside net worth. Most lines contain an option to convert to a term loan upon maturity. 
 Secured term loans are long-term facilities extended typically for the purpose of financing the purchase of a long term asset. At a minimum, they will be collateralized by the asset being purchased. They may also be secured by an existing long term business asset or outside collateral pledged by the guarantor or borrower. Unsecured term loans are usually extended only to well-known borrowers who have established strong cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. Although Bank policy allows term loans for up to ten years, the preference is to offer self-amortizing term loans based on a term of no more than five-to-seven years.
 Paycheck Protection Program. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) appropriated $349.0 billion for Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). On April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the “Economic Aid Act”) appropriated another $284 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP loans that meet U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, are fully guaranteed by the SBA, have an initial term of up to five years and earn interest at rate of 1%. The Bank currently expects a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had disbursed 957 PPP loans totaling $85.3 million, or 7.3% of total loans. These loans resulted in $3.1 million in gross processing fee income to be recognized over the life of the respective loans. 
 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. As of December 31, 2020, there were $25.8 million, or 2.2% of total loans, in unsecured consumer loans, of which $25.5 million comprised of 37,858 individual loans were originated and are serviced by the Bank pursuant to its arrangements with Grain. In addition, there were $737,000 in loans with passbook feature.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Bank’s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exemptions, 15% of its total regulatory capital. The Bank’s lending limit as of December 31, 2020 was $23.5 million, with the ability to lend additional amounts up to 10% if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2020, the Bank complied with these loans-to-one borrower limitations. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s largest aggregate exposure to one borrower was $20.5 million with an outstanding balance of $13.1 million. The second and third largest exposures were $15.8 million and $15.0 million with outstanding balances of $1.9 million and $6.0 million, respectively. No other loan or loans-to-one borrower, individually or cumulatively, exceeded $14.5 million, or 61.7% of the lending limit.

The Bank’s lending is subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on loan requests are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that the Bank obtains and property valuations, consistent with the appraisal policy. The appraisals are prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers and reviewed by third parties, all approved by the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee usually reviews appraisals in considering a loan application. The performance of the appraisers is also subject to internal evaluations using scorecards and are assessed periodically. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and all information provided with the application and checklists provided as part of the application package are evaluated by the loan underwriting department. 
 The lending approval process starts with the processing of the application package, which is reviewed for completeness and then all necessary agency reports are ordered. Upon initial review and preparation of preliminary documents by the processors in the underwriting department, the file is assigned to an underwriter. The underwriters are responsible for presenting the loan request along with a recommendation, to the Loan Committee, and to the Board of Directors when the credit exposure is greater than the Loan Committee’s authority or there are exceptions to the loan policy. If approved, closed and booked, the loan reviewers then undertake the responsibility of monitoring the credit file for the life of the loan by assessing the borrower’s creditworthiness periodically, given certain criteria and following certain operating procedures. An independent third party also performs loan reviews following similar criteria and scope under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 At this time, the Bank does not originate loans with the intent of selling them into the secondary market. 
 Mortgage World loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. Mortgage World intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 4.7% of Mortgage World total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 83.0% of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. Mortgage World is permitted to close loans in five states and has closed approximately 98.6% of its loan volume in New York and New Jersey.
 
Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
 
Delinquency Procedures. Collection efforts commence the day following the grace period, normally on the 17th of the month.  Those loans that have experienced sporadic late payments over the previous 12 months are reviewed with a greater degree of diligence. Late notices are generated and distributed on the 17th and 30th day of the month. The Collection Department pursues collection efforts up until the 90th day past due. At that time, the Bank usually will initiate legal proceedings for collection or foreclosure unless it is in the best interest of the Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a suitable workout plan. 
 Prior to acquiring property through foreclosure proceedings, the Bank will obtain an updated appraisal to determine the fair market value and proceed with net adjustments according to accounting principles. Board of Directors approval is required to pursue a foreclosure.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank collected $100,000 and $162,000, respectively, of interest income on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans, of which $7,000 and $24,000, respectively, was recognized into income. The remaining interest collected on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans for these periods was applied as a principal reduction for the remaining life of the loan, or until the loan is deemed performing.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
Under OCC regulations, when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with its classification of assets policy, it regularly reviews the loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 
 On the basis of this review of loans, the Bank’s classified and special mention loans at the dates indicated were as follows:

Classified Loans: | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Substandard | $ | 20,508 | | $ | 22,787 | | $ | 18,665 | $ | 22,999 | $ | 19,225
Total classified loans | | 20,508 | | | 22,787 | | | 18,665 | | 22,999 | | 19,225

Total classified and special mention loans | $ | 40,054 | | $ | 40,142 | | $ | 33,059 | $ | 28,316 | $ | 21,774

 
Substandard loans decreased $2.3 million, or 10.0%, to $20.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $22.8 million at December 31, 2019.  The decrease of substandard loans was primarily attributable to decreases of $8.4 million in construction and land loans and $379,000 in 1-4 family owner occupied loan, offset by increases of $5.2 million in multifamily loans, $663,000 in 1-4 family investor owned loan and $582,000 in nonresidential loans.
 Special mention loans increased $2.2 million, or 12.6%, to $19.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to two construction multi-family loans which increased in the aggregate by $2.3 million, or 15.2%, to $17.2 million offset by a decrease of $79,000, or 13.3%, in 1-4 family investor owned loans.
 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. The Bank occasionally modifies loans to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. The Bank considers modifications only after analyzing a borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. The Bank generally does not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in its best interest and increases the likelihood that it can collect the remaining principal balance. The Bank may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates, which may be at below market rates, to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and is in the Bank’s best interests.
 
At December 31, 2020, there were 32 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $9.7 million. Of these, 7 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $3.1 million, were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 25 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $6.6 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring. 
 
14


At December 31, 2019, there were 36 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $12.2 million. Of these, 10 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $3.6 million were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 26 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $8.6 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no loans modified to troubled debt restructured and for the year ended December 31, 2019, there was one troubled debt restructured loan amounting to $275,000.
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
 
The Bank has approved and maintained an appropriate, systematic and consistently applied process to determine the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio and other held financial instruments. An inherent loss, as defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and applicable banking regulations, is an unconfirmed loss that probably exists based on the information that is available as of the evaluation date. It is not a loss that may arise from events that might occur as a result of a possible future event. Arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management’s judgment, is inevitably imprecise, and results in a range of possible losses. 
 
The determination of the dollar amounts of the ALLL is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio taking into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan payments at the end of each month. The dollar amounts reported each month for the ALLL are reviewed at least quarterly by the Board of Directors. To ensure that the methodology remains appropriate for the Bank, the Board of Directors periodically has the methodology validated externally and causes revisions to be made when appropriate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees and monitors the internal controls over the ALLL determination process. The Bank adheres to a safe and sound banking practice by maintaining, analyzing, and supporting an adequate ALLL in accordance with GAAP and supervisory guidance. 
 
The Bank’s ALLL methodology consists of a system designed and implemented to estimate loan and lease losses. The Bank’s ALLL methodology incorporates management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process. 
 
The Bank’s loan policy requires the following when the Bank calculates the level of ALLL: 
  
• | All loans shall be taken into consideration in the ALLL methodology whether on an individual or group basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Bank shall identify all loans to be evaluated for impairment on an individual basis under ASC 310 and segment the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups (pools) of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis under ASC 450.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collection of the loan shall be taken into consideration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability shall be considered and applied consistently; however, when appropriate, these factors may be modified for new factors affecting loan collectability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending shall be taken into consideration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The current collateral values, less the costs to sell, shall be taken into consideration when applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Bank shall require that competent and well-trained personnel perform the analysis, estimates, reviews and other ALLL methodology functions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall be based on current and reliable information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall be well documented, in writing, with clear explanations of the supporting analyses and rationale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ALLL methodology shall include a systematic and logical method to consolidate the loss estimates and ensure the ALLL balance is recorded in accordance with GAAP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Loan pools with similar risk characteristics. Loss histories are the starting point for the calculation of ALLL balances. Loss histories are calculated for each of the pools by aggregating the historical losses less recoveries within the respective pools and 
 15


annualizing the number over the determined length of time. The length of time may vary according to the relevance of past periods’ experience to the current period, among other considerations. The Bank currently uses a prior twelve quarter rolling average for its historical loss rates.
 
Each pool’s historical loss rate is adjusted for the effects of the qualitative or environmental factors. The factors analyzed include: 
  
• | Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The existence and effect of any concentration of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the Bank’s existing portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Bank utilizes a risk-based approach to determine the appropriate adjustments for each qualitative factor. A matrix containing definitions of low, medium, and high risk levels is used to assess the individual factors to determine their respective directional characteristics. These risk levels serve as the foundation for determining the individual adjustments for each factor for each pool of loans. 
 The qualitative factor adjustments are supported by applicable reports, graphs, articles and any other relevant information to evidence and document management’s judgment as to the respective levels of risk and adjustment requirements. 
 Each of the qualitative adjustment factors is applied to each of the loan pools to reflect adjustments that increase or decrease the historical loss rates applied to each loan pool. Each of these adjustment factors is individually supported and justified, and a discrete narrative for each loan pool reflects current information, events, circumstances and conditions influencing the adjustment. The narratives include descriptions of each factor, management’s analysis of how each factor has changed over time, which loan pool’s loss rates have been adjusted, the amount by which loss estimates have been adjusted for changes in conditions, an explanation of how management estimated the impact, and other available data that support the reasonableness of the adjustments. 
 Once these qualitative adjustment factors are determined for each pool of loans, they are added to the historical loss numbers for each corresponding pool of loans to arrive at a loss factor for each pool based on historical loss experience and qualitative or environmental influences. These loss factors are adjusted to appropriately reflect the respective risk rating categories within each pool by applying the weighting factors described above to those loans within the respective pool’s risk rates. 
 The series of calculations described above can be expressed as the following equation: 
 [(H*P) + (Q*P)] = R, where 
 H = Historical loss factor for the pool 
 Q = Qualitative/Environmental aggregate adjustment for the pool 
 P = Total loans within the pool 
 R = Required reserve amount for the risk rating category within the pool 
 
16


Specific allowances for identified problem loans. The Bank considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All troubled debt restructured loans and loans on non-accrual status are deemed to be impaired. A specific valuation allowance is established for the impairment amount of each loan, calculated using the present value of expected cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, in accordance with the most likely means of recovery. 
 Factors evaluated in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. The Bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 
 An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. 
 Validation of the ALLL. The Bank considers its ALLL methodology valid when it accurately estimates the amount of probable loss contained in the loan portfolio. The Bank has employed procedures, including the following, when validating the reasonableness of its ALLL methodology and determining whether there may be deficiencies in its overall methodology or loan grading process: 
  
• | A review of trends in loan volume, delinquencies, loan restructurings and concentrations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A review of previous charge-offs and recovery history, including an evaluation of the timeliness of the entries to record both the charge-offs and the recoveries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At a minimum, an annual review by a third party that is independent of the ALLL estimation process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An evaluation of the appraisal process of the underlying collateral.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Bank supports the independent validation process with the work papers from the ALLL review function and may include the summary findings of an independent reviewer. The Board reviews the findings and acknowledges its review in the minutes of its meeting. If the methodology is changed based upon the findings of the validation process, the documentation that describes and supports the changes is maintained. 
 As an integral part of its examination process, the OCC will periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Following such review, the Bank may determine that it is appropriate to recognize additions to the allowance based on its judgment and information available to it at the time of such examination. 
 Current expected credit losses. On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard. In October 2019, the FASB voted to defer implementation of the standard for non-public business entities and smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. In response to the new model, the Bank has reassessed its risk management policies and procedures in order for it to successfully implement CECL. Once adopted, the Bank will have to estimate the allowance for loan losses on expected losses rather than incurred losses.

At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses represented 1.27% of total gross loans and 127.28% of nonperforming loans compared to 1.28% of total loans and 106.30% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $14.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $12.3 million at December 31, 2019. There were $98,000 in net recoveries and $588,000 in net charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Although the Bank believes that it uses the best information available to establish the ALLL, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations, as occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, although the Bank believes that it has established the ALLL in conformity with GAAP, after a review of the loan portfolio by regulators, the Bank may determine it is appropriate to increase the ALLL. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing ALLL may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan or lease deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the ALLL may adversely affect the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
Investment Activities
 
General. The Bank’s investment policy was adopted and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer (designated as the Chief Investment Officer) will plan and execute investment strategies consistent with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the Board of Directors. 
 The current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government-sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; and corporate bonds and obligations, and certificates of deposit in other financial institutions. 
 At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the investment portfolio consisted of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities and obligations issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and the FHLBNY stock. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank owned $6.4 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of FHLBNY stock. As a member of FHLBNY, the Bank is required to purchase stock from the FHLBNY which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. 
 Securities Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at the dates indicated, which consisted of U.S. government and federal agencies, corporate bonds, pass-through mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit.

Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $8.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass through” certificates because the underlying loans are “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one-to-four family residential or multifamily residential mortgages, although the Bank invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family residential mortgages. The issuers of such securities sell the participation interests to investors such as the Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of the Bank’s mortgage-backed securities are backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a government-owned enterprise. 
 Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on the securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits have traditionally been the Bank’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings, primarily from the FHLBNY, brokered and listing service deposits, and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk and manage the cost of funds. At December 31, 2020, the Bank borrowed $117.3 million from FHLBNY. In addition, the Bank receives funds from scheduled loan payments, investment principal and interest payments, maturities and calls, loan prepayments and income on earning assets. Although scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
 Deposits. Deposits are generated primarily from the Bank’s primary market area. The Bank offers a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, NOW/IOLA accounts, money market accounts, reciprocal deposits, savings accounts and certificates of deposit to individuals, business entities, non-profit organizations and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. 
 21


Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and premature withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The Bank relies upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and the favorable image of the Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits. The Bank also provides a fully functional electronic banking platform, including mobile applications, remote deposit capture and online bill pay, among others, as a service to retail and business customers. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. In connection with the Bank’s PPP lending, as of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $43.5 million of PPP related deposits. The ability to attract and maintain these and other interest-bearing deposits, and the rates paid on them, have been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by competition and economic and market conditions. 
 The following table sets forth the average balance and weighted average rate of deposits for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2020, passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a passbook feature totaled $163.0 million, reflecting depositors’ preference for traditional banking services. 
 Borrowings. The Bank may obtain advances from the FHLBNY by pledging as security its capital stock at the FHLBNY and certain of its mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than the Bank’s deposits, they can change the Bank’s interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Bank had $117.3 million and $104.4 million of outstanding FHLBNY advances, respectively. Additionally, the Bank has an unsecured line of credit in the amount of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Bank also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit in an amount of up to $61.5 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Warehouse Line of Credit. Mortgage World maintains two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit are repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines are secured by the assets collaterizing underlying mortgages originated by Mortgage World. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provide for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios. All warehouse facilities are guaranteed by Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2020, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. At December 31, 2020, Mortgage World utilized $30.0 million for funding of loans held for sale and had unused line of credit of $4.9 million.

Regulation and Supervision
 General 
 As a federally-chartered, stock savings association, the Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the OCC, and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as the insurer of deposits. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank is engaging and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 The Bank is regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the “Federal Reserve Board,” which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, the Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLBNY, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated, to a great extent, by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of loan documents. 
 As savings and loan holding companies, the Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, are subject to examination and supervision by, and are required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.

Mortgage World is a mortgage banking entity primarily operating in the New York City metropolitan area. It is a Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) approved Title II lender, giving Mortgage World the ability to process or service single family loans that will be guaranteed by the FHA.  To maintain its license, Mortgage World must comply with certain regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). In addition, Mortgage World is subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services.  
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company, the Bank and Mortgage World. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company, the Bank and Mortgage World. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and Mortgage World and their respective operations. 
 
CARES Act 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act includes provisions impacting financial institutions like the Bank and Mortgage World. The CARES Act allows banks to elect to suspend requirement under GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic (for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. Federal banking agencies are required to defer to the determination of the banks making such suspension.
  The CARES Act created the PPP. The PPP authorizes small business loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on certain debt. The loans are provided through participating financial institutions, such as Bank, that process loan applications and service the loans. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans. On April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated another $284.0 billion for both first and second draw of PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The PPP will expire on May 31, 2021, unless extended by new legislation. 
 
Federal Bank Regulations
 Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Ponce Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
Examinations and Assessments.  The Bank is primarily supervised by the OCC.  The Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC.  The Bank is required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency’s operations. The Company is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board. It is also required to pay assessments to the Federal Reserve Board to fund the agency’s operations. 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4.0% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also 
 25


included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. In 2015, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, made a one-time, permanent election to opt-out regarding the treatment of AOCI. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0.0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50.0% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100.0% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150.0% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0.0% to 600.0% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. 
 At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.

Mortgage World is subject to various net worth requirements in connection with regulatory requirements and lending agreements that Mortgage World has entered into with purchase facility lenders. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Mortgage World’s inability to originate and service loans, and, therefore, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems, audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency pronouncements set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the pronouncements, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to 
 26


implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the OCC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. A savings institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” 
 Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 At December 31, 2020, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%. 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, the Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business. 
 Alternatively, the Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 
 A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2020, the Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
 Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if: 

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before its board of directors declares a dividend. 
 An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
  
• | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 27


 
• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating.  Ponce Bank, received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 Transactions with Related Parties. As a federal savings association, the Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
 The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10.0% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
  
• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties (“CMP”) cover a wide range of violations and actions. CMPs are classified into three tiers based on the actionable conduct and the level of culpability. The law sets maximum amounts that the OCC may assess for each day the actionable conduct continues. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 28


The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity. The FDIC has set the assessment range at 1.5 to 40 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Assessments for most institutions are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years.
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by FICO were due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.48 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. 
 
OTHER REGULATIONS
 Federal Reserve System
 
Generally, Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). In an effort to respond to the negative effects on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated the reserve requirement for depository institutions in order to support lending to households and businesses.  
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of the capital stock of the FHLBNY. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank may also utilize advances from the FHLBNY as a source of investable funds.
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Truth in Savings Act, mandating certain disclosures to depositors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
The operations of the Bank are subject to the:
  
• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires financial institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirement that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies and also affected the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and gave it broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, such as Ponce Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices.

Holding Company Regulations
 
General. The Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, the Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company and their non-savings association subsidiaries, if any. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities of those entities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution.
Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of the Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. The Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company each elected financial holding company status and received applicable clearance on February 21, 2019.
 
30


Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5.0% (“control”) of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. The Federal Reserve Baord adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:
  
• | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Capital. Savings and loan holding companies had historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of its “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and, pursuant to a law enacted in May 2018, increased the threshold for the exception to $3.0 billion. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company, are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.
Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
 
Waivers of Dividends by Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company. The Company may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, unless Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from the Company. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a “non-grandfathered” mutual holding company such as Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, each officer or director of the Company and the Bank, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form.

Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist.

 Federal Securities Laws

 Emerging Growth Company Status
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. The Company will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under SEC regulations (public float less than $250 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under SEC regulations (public float at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

Federal Taxation
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. The Company and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, and Ponce Bank have been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. The Bank currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may not carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) to earlier tax years.  The NOL can be carried forward indefinitely. The use of NOL to offset income is limited to 80%. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Bank, did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no federal NOL carryforwards.
State Taxation
 The Company is treated as a financial institution under Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey state income tax law. The states of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey subject financial institutions to all state and local taxes in the same manner and to the same extent as other business corporations in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Additionally, depository financial institutions are subject to local business license taxes and a special occupation tax. Florida and Pennsylvania treat Mortgage World as a separate business corporation.
 Consolidated Group Return. With tax years beginning after January 1, 2015, New York State and New York City require unitary combined reporting for all entities engaged in a unitary business that meet certain ownership requirements. All applicable entities meet the ownership requirements in the Bank filing group and a combined return is appropriately filed. Furthermore, New Jersey changed its tax laws and now requires combined reporting for tax years that end on or after July 31, 2019 for entities that engage in a unitary business. The Company will also begin filing a combined return in Connecticut for 2020. 
 Single Entity Return. The Company with also file entity returns in the states of Florida and Pennsylvania for Mortgage World for 2020.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on net operating losses generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $1.9 million for New York State purposes and $1.8 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $37.4 million for New York State purposes and $19.4 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards.
