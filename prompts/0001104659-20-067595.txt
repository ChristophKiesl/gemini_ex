ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
American Education Center Inc. (“AEC Nevada”) was incorporated in Nevada in May 2014 as a holding company. AEC Nevada operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries, American Education Center, Inc., incorporated in the State of New York in 1999 (“AEC New York”), and AEC Management Ltd., incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 23, 2018 (“AEC BVI”) and the subsidiaries of AEC BVI.
 
AEC New York was approved and licensed by the Department of the State of New York in 1999 to engage in education consulting service between the U.S. and the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). For more than 20 years, AEC New York has devoted itself to international education exchange between China and the U.S., by providing education and career enrichment opportunities for students, teachers, and educational institutions from both countries.
 
AEC Nevada acquired AEC Southern UK and its subsidiaries in 2016 pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement (as defined below). AEC Southern UK holds 100% of the equity interests in AEC Southern Management Limited, a Hong Kong company (“AEC Southern HK”) incorporated on December 29, 2015, with a registered capital of HK$10,000. AEC Southern UK owns 100% of the equity interests in Qianhai Meijiao Education Consulting Management Co., Ltd. (“AEC Southern Shenzhen”), a foreign wholly owned subsidiary incorporated pursuant to PRC law on March 29, 2016, with a registered capital of RMB5,000,000.
 
AEC BVI acquired AEC Southern HK and its subsidiary, AEC Southern Shenzhen, on April 22, 2019 pursuant to a share transfer agreement by and among the related parties, AEC BVI and AEC Southern UK, for a nominal consideration (the “AEC Southern HK Transfer”). Pursuant to a certain share exchange agreement dated May 1, 2019, AEC Nevada sold 100% of the equity interest in AEC Southern UK, on May 1, 2019, to three individuals, Ye Tian, Rongxia Wang and Weishou Li (the “AEC Southern UK Sale”). Thereafter, AEC Southern UK ceased to be a subsidiary of AEC Nevada.
 
AEC BVI, via its operating entity in the PRC, AEC Southern Shenzhen, serves as a local platform for expanding the Company’s business in mainland China. Our PRC operations are based in the city of Shenzhen, Guangdong province, a city designated by the PRC as a Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”). SEZs are granted a more free-market oriented economic and regulatory environment, with business and tax policies designed to attract foreign investment and technology.
 
Our mission is to become a leading provider of international education services, and to provide total solutions for technology in education field.
 
Currently, we provide four types of consulting services:
 

· | Placement Advisory Services; 
--+----------------------------------------
· | Career Advisory Services; 
· | Student & Family Advisory Services; and
· | Other Advisory Services. 

 
Services to our clients are provided through the Company’s principal executive office in New York, NY and AEC Southern Shenzhen’s office in Shenzhen, China.
 
Leveraging our knowledge of and access to the education system and environment in the U.S., our understanding of China’s market demand for overseas education services and the evolving economy in China, we specialize in the delivery of customized high school and college placement advisory services as well as career advisory services to Chinese students wishing to study and gain post-graduate work experience in the U.S. Our advisory services are specifically designed to address the educational needs of the rising middle-class families in China. The demand for our advisory services is primarily the result of China’s decades-long one-child policy, society’s focus and emphasis on children’s education, and families’ desire to gain access to U.S. colleges and universities as well as work experience in the U.S.
 
Our total revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $5,308,412 and $7,012,439, respectively. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, a vast majority of the revenue was from student advisory services in the U.S., delivered by AEC New York, which accounted for approximately 97.7% of our total revenue. Similarly, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, revenue from student advisory services in the U.S., delivered by AEC New York, accounted for approximately 98.9% of our total revenue. Our strategy is to continue to strengthen localized services provision for students in the U.S. and continue to expand the U.S. market. We have already formulated and are in the process of implementing this multi-stage growth plan by marketing on various media platforms. Based in Shenzhen, we are also promoting localized services for Chinese students through various social media. For detailed information on marketing strategies and growth plans targeting to grow our advisory services in the U.S., refer to “Item 1. Business—Our Marketing Strategies” and “Item 1.

Our Key Revenue Drivers
 
We have expanded our service platform to include advisory services for our student customers wishing to study and gain post-graduate work experiences in the U.S. Currently, our main advisory services include:

· | Placement Advisory Services; 
--+----------------------------------------
· | Career Advisory Services; 
· | Student & Family Advisory Services; and
· | Other Advisory Services. 

 
All advisory services above are provided by our subsidiaries, AEC New York and AEC Southern Shenzhen.
 
Placement Advisory Services
 
Our Placement Advisory Services include Language Training, Placement Advisory and Elite College Advisory services.
 
Since 1999, we have been delivering customized Language Training & Placement Advisory services to Chinese students. Our one-stop advisory service encompasses ESL training and assistance throughout the high school, college application, and admission process.
 
Our Language Training service is based on the existing ESL training platform which provides language training for standard test preparation and is designed to help improve student’s English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Student customers will be able to take these training courses online when our ESL online training platform goes live in 2020.
 
Targeting the needs of Chinese families in obtaining admission to Ivy League and other prestigious universities in the U.S., our Elite College Advisory service is designed to assist qualified Chinese students in applying to prestigious colleges and universities in the U.S. Specifically, we arrange campus tours, assist our student customers with their university applications, provide tailored language training, offer guidance on interview and communication techniques, and follow up on their applications.
 
Once our student customers are admitted into their target universities, our Placement Advisory services further extend to academic and cultural related experiences including, among other things, providing assistance with applying for a second major or minor, transferring to a different university, housing accommodations, and applying for accelerated degrees. To help students optimize their on-campus experience and train their leadership and social skills, we also organize seminars and social events with our partner scholars and universities, non-profit and for-profit business organizations. Additionally, to help enrich their cultural experiences, we organize extracurricular and artistic activities including dance, music, painting, photography, and other performance events.
 
For college application, we have designed the Key School Admissions Program, giving student customers closely guided application consulting services to gain admission to top U.S. universities.
 
For on-campus academic counseling, we offer the Elite100 program that focuses on leadership and communication skills development for our student customers.
 
We provide placement services through both AEC New York and AEC Southern Shenzhen. AEC New York refers businesses to AEC Southern Shenzhen when clients in China need local support.
 
Career Advisory Services
 
Our Career Advisory Services include our Internship Advisory program and our Start-up Advisory program.
 
Our Internship Advisory program focuses on student’s career development by helping them identify and secure suitable internship and part-time or full-time work opportunities that are appropriate for their educational background and experience level. Through this program, we strive to help students map and navigate their career path and counsel them on matters including academic improvement to career assistance. Through this program, our student customers are given opportunities to communicate with professionals in their field of study and to participate in real-world case studies.
 
Our Start-up Advisory program provides advisory services to individual students and/or their families who want to start or make an investment in a business in the U.S. Collaborating with our strategic partners, our services include (i) recommending alternative business development opportunities; (ii) assistance with business plan development; (iii) assistance with accounting and financial management, marketing, product and project design; and (iv) assistance in project financing.

Student & Family Advisory Services
 
Our Student & Family Advisory Services are designed to assist our students and/or their families in the process of settling down in the U.S., such that they can effectively focus on their studies. We provide thorough services tailored to the unique needs of each student family encountered in the U.S.
 
Through our business partners, we assist the students’ families with purchasing real estate properties, organizing their personal financial management and investment needs, getting insurance and starting businesses. Our American Dream Program helps students’ families find investment projects in the U.S. We also advise corporate clients whose executives are moving to the U.S. for work. The scope of our services includes assistance with business consulting, relocation and other aspects of family support services.
 
Other Advisory Services
 
Through our Foreign Student Recruitment services, we assist universities in China to recruit students from the U.S. We customize this service based on our strategic relationship with college and universities in the U.S. and the specific recruitment goals of these universities in China. The demand for our recruitment services is driven mainly by the lack of an established channel to attract students from the U.S. and the needs by the Chinese universities to expand and diversify their student body.
 
Our Foreign Educator Placement services are designed to meet the increasing demand for experienced educators and teachers from the U.S. to teach in China. Such demand covers the need to recruit qualified US educators from Pre K-12 to teach in China.
 
Recent Development 
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closure of stores and facilities in China and elsewhere. A substantial part of the Company’s revenue and workforce are concentrated in China. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak may materially adversely affect the Company’s business operations and its financial condition and operating results for 2020, including but not limited to material negative impact to the Company’s total revenues. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the extent of the business disruption and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
 
On May 22, 2020, AEC Southern HK formed Yiqilai (Shenzhen) Consulting Management Co., Ltd. (“WOFE”) in the PRC. We intend to use WOFE as the primary entity to carry out our plan to identify and acquire an operating company in the PRC for online education e-commerce platform business. This new subsidiary is expected to expand and add to the our current business and is expected to better serve the our student customers.

Our Competitive Advantage
 
Our strength comes mainly from our understanding of the Chinese education and education-related service markets and our ability in not only anticipating areas with great market demand but also delivering quality, customized services on a consistent basis. We have a scalable business platform that is conducive to growth in earnings and profitability; and have a business model that we believe adapts well to changing market conditions. We believe that the following competitive strengths enhance our position in the markets that we are currently competing in:

· | Experienced Management. Our management team is comprised of industry experts with extensive experience in the education service industry, knowledge of the education system in the U.S. and a deep understanding of the Chinese market as well as finance executives who specializes in mergers and acquisitions, business reorganization, internal controls and risk management. We have established a corporate culture that is based on integrity, built compliance into risk management, integrated structure and discipline into our operating management and financial reporting processes, and made it a priority to deliver quality, customized services without compromising our ability to generate sustainable operating profits.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Proven Business Model. Our business model is to target those service areas that are driven by significant market demand and have potential for sustainable growth in the long run. We take a measured approach in growing our business and have been effective in anticipating market needs as we expand our customer base from students to corporate clients that need corporate training. As a total solutions education advisory services provider, we have been successful in meeting the market demand for quality education and career development in the U.S.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalable Business Platform. As an emerging business in the education service business, we believe we have the structure and discipline to control our operating expenses and overhead as we grow our business and strive to improve our operating profits. By keeping a relatively low headcount and optimizing the use of outsourced industry experts, we believe we have been effective in delivering quality services while maintaining healthy operating margins.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customized Service Approach. Our success is built on our reputation in delivering consistent, reliable, quality, and customized advisory services. Our approach is result oriented and we customize our service based on the specific needs of our student and corporate customers.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading total solutions educational services provider for Chinese students wishing to study and gain work experiences in the U.S. Our business development plan includes, among other things, the following strategic initiatives:

· | Expand organically within existing markets and into new markets. To carry out our vision of strengthening our market position in the U.S., we are implementing a combination of on- and off-line marketing approaches to expand our student-customer base in markets we currently serve. Such approaches include the recently launched Membership Program that is designed to maximize the power of personal and commission-based referral of our services to other potential customers; and the AEC Help mobile application, a social network platform that is intended to bring students together under one roof, offering them alternative solutions to issues frequently encountered by foreign students in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our Membership Program allows third-party agents and education service providers, either individuals or entities, to sign up as members. Benefits to becoming our members include access to all programs pursuant to our student advisory services currently provided by AEC New York. Our members typically have access to clients with needs that can be met by programs provided by AEC New York. After paying a one-time, non-refundable fee of $50,000 to become a member, members can seamlessly integrate our services with their service offerings by outsourcing the specific services to us. We believe the Membership Program will allow us to broaden the reach of our brand and services without establishing additional offices in China and in the U.S.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our AEC Help mobile application was developed in-house and is operated by AEC New York. It is an iOS app that users can download for free from Apple AppStore. Users are international students who are in the U.S. or seek to study in the U.S. The app provides various academic and non-academic resources compiled by us to assist users for studying and living in the U.S. Resources available through the AEC Help app include academic resources where users can filter and search for universities based on the user’s own test scores and preferences, and non-academic resources such as unit conversions, maps, real-time exchange rates, student events, etc. Where the online resources cannot provide sufficient assistance to our users, they are able to reach a member of our staff who will connect the user with a third-party service provide directly. We believe this social media network, AEC Help, will allow us to broaden our reach to potential student customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To grow organically, we plan to expand our service offerings to existing student customers, as well as deepening our strategic relationships with top universities, top companies, and top recruitment agencies, to aggregate our resources to collectively deliver customized career advisory services. Previously, we intended to launch the Other Recruitment & Placement Services, which include our Foreign Student Recruitment services and Foreign Educator Placement services in 2019. However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, this plan has been postponed to 2020. As of the date of this annual report, we believe we will be able to implement this plan next year. For detailed information on the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19, refer to “Item 1. Business—Outbreak of COVID-19.”

· | Through our Foreign Student Recruitment services, we will assist universities in China to recruit foreign students from the U.S. and other countries. We customize this service based on our relationship with universities in China and their specific recruitment goals. We believe the demand for our recruitment services is driven mainly by the lack of an established channel to attract students from the U.S. and the needs to expand and diversify the university’s student body.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our Foreign Educator Placement services are designed to meet the increasing demand for experienced educators from the U.S. to teach in China. Based on our understanding of the market demand, we believe there is a significant service opportunity for us to recruit qualified U.S. educators from Pre-K-12 to college to teach in China.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Technology Platforms. We believe that our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to vertically integrate training courses and content delivery, specifically, complementing and integrating off-line, in person delivery with off-the-shelf, online delivery of training modules, which will increase the scalability of our operation. We are in the process of completing the development of an online ESL/language training platform for our student customers as well as an online training platform for our customer’s corporate clients in China which, when completed and launched, will allow participants to access our training courses on demand and on a 24/7 basis. Leveraging these two newly developed online training platforms, we believe we could realize significant growth in our revenues from language training as well as corporate training.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mergers and Acquisitions. We plan to grow our training and advisory business through acquisitions and intend to replicate our success by identifying potential merger and acquisition targets, especially training institutions that are successful in their respective fields or industries, to efficiently and rapidly broaden our service offering. In addition, we are performing market research to identify suitable new markets and suitable targets in the education and training industry that are potentially profitable such as trade skills training, and personal development.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As part of our growth strategy, we acquired AIFI in 2018. We intend to provide, through AIFI, financial education and services through its training and certification programs with the goal in building a financial education information ecosystem to cultivate people’s sound financial judgement and decision-making abilities. The AIFI programs are intended to provide extensive and important financial literacy knowledge and relevant services to the financial services industry, non-profit organizations and schools. Specific target audiences include but are not limited to industry professionals, financial literacy educators, lending industry customers, college students, and K-12 students. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not generate any revenue from AIFI.

Our Management Team
 
We believe we have a strong and experienced management team including our founder, chief executive officer, interim chief financial officer, and chairman, Mr. Max P. Chen, a pioneer and leader in the education service industry; Ms. Congying Fang, the director, president, and the chief executive officer of AEC BVI; and Ms. Weihua Zhu, the chief operating officer of AEC New York with over a decade of experience in education advisory services. Our team as a whole has many years of public and private company experience, industry and professional experience and a significant network of business contacts in the industry, and extensive experience in SEC reporting, compliance and risk management, business reorganization, and mergers and acquisitions.
Our Industry and Market Opportunities
 
The demand for global education is growing rapidly in China, and the U.S. remains the top choice for Chinese students wishing to study abroad. According to one article published by the PRC’s Ministry of Education in March 2018, approximately 5.19 million Chinese students had studied in foreign countries in the past 40 years since 1978.

The number of Chinese students entering the U.S. to study grew sharply in 2006, when Congress loosened restrictions on student visas from China for the first time since 2001. Accordingly, there is a large and growing number of Chinese students in the U.S. seeking a broad range of acclimation support and services, including education consulting services. We strive to become a bridge for these students with our service offerings.
 
According to Project Atlas, a collaborative global research initiative led by the Institute of International Education, in the academic year 2018/2019, the total number international students studying in the U.S. (in both public and private institutions) was 1,095,299, of which 369,548, or 33.7%, were Chinese nationals. For the academic year 2017/2018, the comparable figures were 1,094,792 international students in the U.S., of whom 33.2% or 363,341 were Chinese. This growth trend has been in place for several years. However, with the current political environment in Washington, DC regarding visas, it is not known whether it will continue in the future.

Our Competition
 
The education service and consulting industry targeting both PRC citizens abroad and PRC residents is rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive. We expect competition in this industry to persist and intensify. For services provided by AEC New York, we primarily serve Chinese student customers and their families in the U.S. For services provided by AEC BVI, our prospective student clients are primarily located in China.
 
Our advisory services for student customers face significant competition from New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc., a leader in the market of advisory services for student customers that we operate in.
 
Our Marketing Strategies
 
We believe prospective student customers are attracted to our advisory services due to our excellent brand name, personalized service model, and the quality of our services. Historically, as a small business, we rely extensively on our strategic partners and word-of-mouth referrals in growing our student customers, and employ the following marketing and recruiting methods to attract new student customers:
 
Commission-based referrals. To enhance the effectiveness of the referral process, we pay a commission that ranges from 10% to 20% for successful referrals. Our placement advisory and career advisory services have benefited from, and are expected to continue to benefit from, commission-based referrals by our current and former student customers.
 
Marketing materials. We plan to publish a “Chinese Visitors Guide Book.” It is planned to be a travel book with plug-in advertisements for the Company, which will assist Chinese visitors to the U.S. and simultaneously promote our services. We will also advertise in e-magazines, prepare and distribute brochures and present at exhibitions as part of our marketing strategy.
 
Social media marketing. We maintain our own WeChat official account that offers information on education and life abroad. In addition, we work with other WeChat official accounts with significant followings to publish information on AEC services. After every offline event, our employees will create chat groups with all event attendants to facilitate direct communication and follow up.
 
We have launched our in-house developed mobile application—AEC Help. It is an iOS app that users can download for free from the Apple AppStore. Users are international students who are in the U.S. or seek to study in the U.S. The app provides various academic and non-academic resources compiled by us to assist users for studying and living in the U.S. Resources available through AEC Help Application include academic resources where users can filter and search for universities based on the user’s own test scores and preferences, and non-academic resources such as unit conversions, maps, real-time exchange rates, student events, etc. Where the online resources cannot provide sufficient assistance to our users, they are able to reach a member of our staff who will connect the user with a third-party service provide directly. We believe this social media network, AEC Help, will allow us to broaden our reach to potential student customers.
 
Our Customers
 
We currently provide services to Chinese students wishing to study and/or gain work experience in the U.S. Some of these Chinese students are our direct customers, and the others are ultimate users of our services through corporate customers we serve.
 
Our target corporate customers include staffing agencies and student placement agencies. Our target student customers include high school students who want to apply for U.S. colleges, college students who need academic counseling and future career consulting, and graduates who need professional development, as well as students’ families. The cost of studying abroad is high, therefore international students usually come from middle class or high-net-worth families.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our two largest customers, Oxbridge International Group Inc. and Skybound Consulting Inc. accounted for 50.3% and 21.5% of our revenues, respectively. 
 
Our Regulatory Environment
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in the U.S.
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the Federal, state and local level, extensively regulate education and exchange student programs. Such regulations include, among other things, the regulations, and policies of the United States Department of Education. Unlike the systems of most other countries, however, the education system in the U.S. is highly decentralized, and the Federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards. The establishment and grading of such standards have been left to state and local school districts.
 
The Education Department of the State of New York in 1999 consented for AEC New York to incorporate pursuant to §216 of New York Education Law Relating to Education Corporations, and Section 104 of the New York Business Corporation Law, and consented in 2003 for AEC New York to amend its certificate of incorporation to include education consulting service as its business purpose, pursuant to §216 of New York Education Law Relating to Education Corporations, and Section 104(e) of the New York Business Corporation Law.

A more formalized regulation is the requirement that a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the U.S. must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. Foreign students must have a student visa to study in the U.S. Visas generally require an application and an interview.
 
In addition to the regulatory approval requirements described above, we are or will be, directly or indirectly, subject to extensive regulation of the educational industry by the Federal and state governments and the governments’ of foreign countries in which our services are provided.
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in China
 
The principal laws and regulations governing private education in China consist of the Education Law of the PRC, the Law for Promoting Private Education (2003), the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004), and Law for Promoting Private Education (2016).
 
Under these regulations, “private schools” are defined as schools established by non-governmental organizations or individuals using non-government funds. Private schools providing academic qualifications education, kindergarten education, education for self-study examination, and other education shall be subject to approval by the education authorities at or above the county level, while private schools engaging in occupational qualification training and occupational skill training shall be subject to approvals from the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare at or above the county level.
 
Since our operations in the PRC are either delivered through our AEC New York office for education consulting services, placement services, and family support services, or through our AEC Southern UK operation for corporate training, we believe we are not involved in providing services relating to the fundamental education systems of the PRC, which include a school system of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education and a system of education certificates. Therefore, we believe our operations in the PRC are not subject to the PRC Private Education Laws. If our operations are found to be subject to, and/or in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules, or policies or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, or if interpretations of the foregoing changes, we and our PRC subsidiaries may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions.
 
Foreign Investment in Educational Service Industry
 
The Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, promulgated the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment, or the “Catalogue,” as amended on March 10, 2015, which came into effect on April 10, 2015, and as further amended on June 28, 2017, and came into effect on July 28, 2017 (the “2017 Catalogue”). On June 28, 2018, the MOFCOM and NDRC promulgated the Special Measures for Foreign Investment Access (2018 version), or the “2018 Negative List,” terminating the 2017 Catalogue. According to the 2018 Negative List, any foreign investment in preschool education, senior high school education, and higher education has to take the form of a cooperative joint venture. Foreign investment is banned from compulsory education, which means grades one to nine. Foreign investment is allowed in after-school tutoring services and training services that do not grant certificates or diplomas. We do not believe we are subject to the aforementioned bans on foreign investment in educational service industries.
Employment Laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, social insurance, housing funds, and other welfare. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance.
 
China’s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and China’s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract. The National Labor Contract Law has enhanced rights for the nation’s workers, including permitting open-ended labor contracts and severance payments. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary labor, and makes it harder for employers to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed once or the employee has worked for the employer for a consecutive 10-year period.
 
As required under the Regulation of Insurance for Labor Injury implemented on January 1, 2004, and amended in 2010, the Provisional Measures for Maternity Insurance of Employees of Corporations implemented on January 1, 1995, the Decisions on the Establishment of a Unified Program for Old-Aged Pension Insurance of the State Council issued on July 16, 1997, the Decisions on the Establishment of the Medical Insurance Program for Urban Workers of the State Council promulgated on December 14, 1998, the Unemployment Insurance Measures promulgated on January 22, 1999, and the Social Insurance Law of the PRC implemented on July 1, 2011, employers are required to provide their employees in the PRC with welfare benefits covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, labor injury insurance and medical insurance. In accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Housing Fund which was promulgated by the State Council in 1999 and amended in 2002, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. Employer and employee are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time. Except for housing funds, we are in compliance with payment of all other employment related insurance on behalf of our employees.

Taxation in the U.S.
 
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
 
· changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
 · expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;
 · tax effects of stock-based compensation;
 · costs related to intercompany restructurings;
 · changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and
 · lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.
 
In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income and sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities.
 
Taxation in the PRC
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax (“VAT”) of the PRC, or the “VAT Regulations,” which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value Added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the PRC are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 16% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 10% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution in the U.S.
 
Our Board of Directors’ ability to declare a dividend is subject to restrictions imposed by Nevada corporate law. Nevada corporate law provides that no distribution (including dividends on, or redemption or repurchases of, shares of capital stock) may be made if, after giving effect to such distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or, (ii) except as otherwise specifically permitted by the articles of incorporation, the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed at the time of a dissolution to satisfy the preferential rights of preferred stockholders. Directors may consider financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices that are reasonable in the circumstances, a fair valuation, including but not limited to unrealized appreciation and depreciation, and any other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution in the PRC

Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in China may pay dividends only out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required, as other enterprises subject to PRC laws, to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund statutory reserve funds until the cumulative amount of such funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. For our PRC subsidiary that has achieved profit under the PRC accounting standards, it has set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits to meet the statutory reserve requirements. A wholly foreign-owned enterprise may, at its discretion, allocate a portion of its after-tax profits calculated based on the PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. Our subsidiary has not set aside its after-tax profits, if any, to fund these discretionary staff welfare and bonus funds. We have not implemented any policy or plan for our PRC subsidiaries to maintain discretionary staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes. These requirements apply to AEC Southern Shenzhen. 
 
M&A Rules and Overseas Listings
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, State Administration for Industry & Commerce, or SAIC, China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, jointly adopted the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Projects by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This M&A Rules purport to require, among other things, offshore special purpose vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. While the application of the M&A Rules remains unclear, we believe, based on the advice of our PRC counsel, that CSRC approval was not required in the context of our initial public offering as we are not a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of acquiring domestic companies that are controlled by our PRC individual shareholders, as we acquired contractual control rather than equity interests in our domestic affiliated entities. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government agency, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that we needed to obtain the CSRC’s approval for our initial public offering or if CSRC, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Common Stock.
 
Properties/Facilities
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2 Wall Street, Floor 8, New York, NY 10005 (the “Headquarters”). We entered into a lease agreement for the Headquarters with an unrelated third-party landlord, pursuant to which the Company pays a monthly rent of $34,056. The Headquarters lease expires on July 31, 2025.
 
AEC Southern Shenzhen entered into a new lease in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to which it leases office space from an unrelated third party on a month to month basis with a monthly rental cost of RMB52,456 (approximately US$8,497). The lease will expire on April 30, 2024.
 
We believe our facilities are sufficient for our business operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the filing date hereof, the Company has 20 full and part-time employees inclusive of outsourced consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We did not have, during the periods presented, and we are currently not a party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Seasonality
 
AEC New York typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations, primarily due to quarterly changes in student enrollments related to the admission seasons. AEC BVI does not experience substantial seasonality in its revenues and results of operations.

Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark and trade secret law and confidentiality and invention assignment with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Our intellectual property includes two domain names, https://americaneducationcenter.org/and https://aec100.com.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 
In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring their non-infringement of our intellectual property rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Moreover, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.
