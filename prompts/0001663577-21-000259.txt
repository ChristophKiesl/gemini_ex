Item 1. Business
Our Business
 
The business plan of the company will no longer be focused on a chewing gum delivery system but it will re-focus its activities to the development of cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like, and non-cannabinoid pharmaceutical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), pharmaceutical medicines made from cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like, and non- cannabinoid APIs and the development of ingredients and products with the aim of achieving European novel food approval of cannabinoid-based, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid ingredients and products .In addition, the company plans to develop such bulk ingredients for supply into the cosmetic sector.
 
Because the IP relating to the development of a chewing gum with nutraceutical/functional ingredients is not relevant to the pharmaceutical development that the company plans to undertake, the IP surrounding the chewing gum may no longer benefit the company’s operations going forward. While company has not yet decided on the proper disposition of the IP at present, the company will likely divest ownership in the near future.
 
The new business plan of the company is for the company’s operations to be repositioned as a fully regulatory- compliant pharmaceutical company specializing in the development of the following:
 
•  cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid pharmaceutical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) globally;
 
• | pharmaceutical medicines made from cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid APIs globally;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid food-grade ingredients with the aim of achieving European novel food approval of such ingredients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 •  non-pharmaceutical (nutraceutical / dietary supplement) products containing cannabinoids, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid food-grade  ingredients with the aim of achieving European novel food approval of such products; and
 •  Supply of cosmetic ingredients to potential customers who may develop products containing cannabinoids, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid ingredients
 
The controlled drugs / cannabinoid pharmaceutical market worldwide has experienced exponential growth over the past few years in the development of cannabinoid medicines. It is Alterola’s intention to develop ingredients and products on a global basis, fully compliant with the appropriate international laws and regulations and also compliant with the relevant national laws and regulations on a territory-by-territory basis.
 
In December 2020, the company retained new management and board members that have experience in the pharmaceutical, botanical and nutraceutical industries. Further to this objective, the company is also interested in recruiting key executives and personnel that have experience in the controlled drugs / cannabinoid medicines industry. The focus will be on recruiting outstanding talents that have contributed or can contribute more in the future with the company’s expansion plans.
 
The company also has interest in licensing / acquiring other IP from companies that have IP pertinent to the aforementioned products the company plans to develop. Under consideration are companies that have existing pharmaceutical research and/or development or manufacturing capability or associated IP. Some of these companies have IP which is available to integrate into our company strategy. These acquisition or in-licensing opportunities are expected to facilitate the company to develop API and medicines globally and food-grade ingredients and products for the food and beverage industry in Europe.

Operations of ABTI Pharma
 
ABTI Pharma Ltd is a UK-based pharmaceutical company developing cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like, and non- cannabinoid pharmaceutical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), pharmaceutical medicines made from cannabinoid, cannabinoid-like, and non-cannabinoid APIs and targeting European novel food approval of cannabinoid-based, cannabinoid-like and non-cannabinoid ingredients and products .In addition, the company is seeking to develop such bulk ingredients for supply into the cosmetic sector.
 
ABTI Pharma Ltd is a UK-based pharma company working with cannabinoid and cannabinoid like molecules. It has three areas of focus:
 
1)  Development of regulated pharmaceuticals (human and animal health) and regulated food products. This has been achieved via the strategic acquisition of Phytotherapeutix Ltd.
 
2)  Production of low cost of goods Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and food-grade ingredients (supported by the strategic acquisition of Ferven Ltd), and
 
3)  Formulation, and drug delivery, providing improved bioavailability, solubility and stability (supported by the exclusive licensing of IP and technology from Nano4M Ltd).
 
Phytotherapeutix Ltd, is a company which has been acquired, which has generated a number of molecules with patents pending, some of which have demonstrable pharmacological activity, similar to that of CBD. This means that some of these molecules are anticipated to have a similar market potential to CBD across a range of therapeutic areas.
 
Ferven Ltd, is a company, which is looking to produce cannabinoids by fermentation. The exclusively licensed organism has the potential to be genetically modified to produce multiple cannabinoids at a very low cost of goods. It is anticipated that the selected genetically modified organisms will grow very quickly, which in turn, reduces the cost of production.
 
Nano4M Ltd is a company which has exclusively licensed its nano-formulation patents and know-how to ABTI Pharma Ltd.
 
Additionally, in principle agreements have been reached to bring a number of other IP-protected technologies into Alterola via the deal with ABTI Pharma.
 
ABTI Pharma management has extensive proven experience, know-how and connections in the cannabinoid medicines sector, and is looking to utilize this knowledge and experience for the development of such medicines from existing cannabinoids and cannabinoid-like molecules.

Competition
 
Pharmaceutical Sector
 
The cannabinoid-based and cannabinoid-like pharmaceutical medicine research and development sector and is and will likely remain competitive. In general, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs / medicines.
 
We expect that Alterola will be required to compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as drugs and processes being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may develop or may already have developed drugs comparable or competitive with our pipeline drug candidates. Competitive therapeutic treatments for diseases, disorders and medical conditions that are included in our pipeline development projects have already been approved by the pharmaceutical regulatory bodies around the world (e.g. FDA, EMA etc.) and used / prescribed by the medical community and any new treatments that may enter the market would face fierce competition.
 
We are aware of a number of companies that are engaged in cannabinoid-based drug development. In addition, several other U.S.-based companies are in early stage discovery and preclinical development utilizing synthetic and/or plant- derived cannabinoids such as CBD and/or THC.
 
Non-Pharmaceutical Sector
 
Due to Federal regulation, it is not currently possible to develop THC or CBD-containing products for non- pharmaceutical use (e.g. as food ingredients or dietary supplements) in the USA. However, it is possible to develop cannabinoid- containing ingredients and products in the food sector in Europe through the Novel Food Approvals route.
 Again this sector is and will likely remain competitive in territories where it is legal to develop and sell such products. Further it is also possible to develop cannabinoid-containing ingredients in the cosmetics sector.
 
For both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical markets, established companies may have a competitive advantage due to their size and experiences, positive cash flows and institutional networks. Many of our pharma and non-pharma competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Due to these factors, our competitors may have a range of competitive advantages and may obtain regulatory approval of their active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), or medicines; or food ingredients or food products or cosmetic ingredients before we are able to develop or commercialize our pharma or non pharma active ingredients or products. Our competitors may also develop ingredients or products that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours.
 Furthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share and/or increase their ingredient or product lines.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology and non-pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies, such as ours, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We aim to compete with large and small companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, and using our management knowhow and expertise in the sector to develop ingredients and products in a compliant manner, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our development programs.
 
Intellectual Property:
 
Through the acquisition of ABTI Pharma, Alterola has acquired ABTI Pharma’s IP portfolio, which includes:
 
1)  IP including patent applications pertaining to novel compounds for development of pharmaceutical drug candidates and their therapeutic use;
 
2)  IP (including organisms, protocols and knowhow) pertaining to low cost of goods production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and food-grade ingredients; and
 

5
-

3)  IP including granted patents pertaining to particle engineering technology, formulation, and drug delivery technologies, which will provide improved drug performance.
 
In addition, ABTI Pharma have in principle agreements to bring in additional complimentary technologies with incumbent IP.
 
Regulatory Matters Pharmaceuticals USA
 As a development stage company that intends to have its pipeline drug candidates approved in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by regulatory agencies. The U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our drugs (medicines). Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulations that are similar in nature and scope as those in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the European Commission, but country- specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be successful.
 
Given that the active ingredients present in our APIs, food ingredients and cosmetic ingredients are in some cases considered to be controlled substances in certain jurisdictions / territories, there are additional regulations which are applicable to the research, development, import, receipt, possession, storage, preparation, extraction, synthesis, biosynthesis, manufacture, processing, analysis, release, formulation, dispensing, packaging and labelling, import/export, transport, commercialization, advertising and supply / distribution of Controlled Substances. This means that Alterola needs to be compliant with competent authorities such as the DEA (USA), The Home Office (UK) and the corresponding authorities in each country.
 
We intend to conduct some of our research and development relating to our drug candidates in the United States, at which time, our research and development, future manufacturing, distribution and sale of our drugs will become subject to the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 While cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, drugs approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement. If any of our pipeline drug candidates will receive approval by the FDA, it must be listed by the DEA as an appropriately scheduled controlled substance to be allowed for commercialization.
 
Consequently, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use of our future drugs will be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. In addition, individual states in the United States have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our drugs.
 
Europe
 
It is the company’s intention have its pipeline drug candidates approved in countries in addition to the USA and hence we are subject to extensive regulation by other international regulatory agencies, and the applicable local laws and regulations.
 
Similarly to the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the USA and its implementing regulations, there are similar laws and regulations in Europe for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our drugs (medicines). Again, our activities in Europe will be subject to regulations that are similar in nature and scope as those in the United States, although there can be important differences.

Our pipeline candidates may be developed or approved through the Centralized Procedure or Decentralized Procedure through the or through the Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) through the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the European Commission; however it should be noted that country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate national, federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be successful.
 
Again, given that the active ingredients present in our APIs, food ingredients and cosmetic ingredients are in some countries are considered to be controlled substances in certain European jurisdictions / territories, there are additional regulations which are applicable to the research, development, import, receipt, possession, storage, preparation, extraction, synthesis, biosynthesis, manufacture, processing, analysis, release, formulation, dispensing, packaging and labelling, import/export, transport, commercialisation, advertising and supply / distribution of Controlled Substances. This means that Alterola needs to be compliant with each competent authority in each European country as applicable.
 
Japan
 
It is the company’s intention have its pipeline drug candidates in due course approved in Japan and hence we are subject to extensive regulation by the pharmaceutical regulatory authority of Japan: the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau (PFSB) of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), and the Japanese applicable local laws and regulations.
 
Japan has its own laws and regulations for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our drugs (medicines).
 
Again, given that the active ingredients present in our APIs, food ingredients and cosmetic ingredients are in some countries are considered to be controlled substances in Japan, there are additional regulations which are applicable to the research, development, import, receipt, possession, storage, preparation, extraction, synthesis, biosynthesis, manufacture, processing, analysis, release, formulation, dispensing, packaging and labelling, import/export, transport, commercialization, advertising and supply / distribution of Controlled Substances. This means that Alterola needs to be compliant with the Japanese competent authority requirements.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate national and local statutes and regulations of Japan require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be successful.
 
Rest of the World
 
It is the company’s intention have its pipeline drug candidates in due course approved in other countries around the world (Rest of World) and hence we are subject to extensive regulation by the various national pharmaceutical regulatory authorities which govern the various countries, and the applicable local laws and regulations.
 
Different countries have different laws and regulations for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our drugs (medicines).
 
Again, given that the active ingredients present in our APIs, food ingredients and cosmetic ingredients are in some countries are considered to be controlled substances in some countries, there are additional regulations which are applicable to the research, development, import, receipt, possession, storage, preparation, extraction, synthesis, biosynthesis, manufacture, processing, analysis, release, formulation, dispensing, packaging and labelling, import/export, transport, commercialization, advertising and supply / distribution of Controlled Substances. This means that Alterola needs to be compliant with each competent authority in each country as applicable.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate national, federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations of other countries (ex-US, Europe and Japan) require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be successful.

The Regulatory Process for the approval of New Medicines
 
The company operate in a highly controlled new drugs / medicines regulatory environment. Strict regulations establish requirements relating to demonstration of quality, safety and efficacy of a medicine. Regulations also cover preclinical and clinical research and development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post- approval. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. Further, many countries have stringent regulations relating to the possession and use of cannabis or cannabinoid or cannabis-based medicines.
 
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our future drug candidates, we must demonstrate that the proposed medicine demonstrates quality, safety and efficacy. From a quality perspective this is done through demonstrating appropriate chemistry and manufacturing controls (CMC), and from a safety and efficacy perspective, this is done through demonstrating that our drug candidates are safe and effective in preclinical studies and clinical trials.. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, many pharmaceuticals have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.
 
We expect to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, the development of quality ingredients and products as well as preclinical studies and clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a drug candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other drug candidates and hinder our ability to develop and / or conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Additionally, if we have pipeline candidate failures, we may also be expected to experience challenges, delays or even the inability to obtain additional financing at acceptable terms and conditions to develop these or other drug candidates.
 
Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new drug be approved or exempted from approval before it is marketed, and have established high standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval of a new medicine or indication varies by country and some drugs are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting new product or formulation development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
United States
 
In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the safety and effectiveness standards for our drugs and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, distribution, advertising and promotion of drug candidates on a product-by-product basis.
 
Preclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the drug candidate, including animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. In addition, non-clinical studies (Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls, CMC) are undertaken to evaluate a new drug’s chemistry, and to determine, amongst other things, the active ingredients’ and finished product formulation’s stability and batch-to-batch reproducibility.
 
After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, a Sponsor files an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, to begin clinical development (clinical trials in humans). Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical development program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent. In Phase I, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of drug candidates. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of drug candidates, and to determine appropriate dose ranges in
 

8
-


patients with the target indication. In Phase III, clinical trials are conducted in appropriate patient populations to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. The time and expense that will be required for us to perform this clinical development can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III clinical trials within any specific period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB are responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. Given that a number of our clinical trials are likely to be performed using drug candidates containing controlled substances, there is the added requirement for compliance with DEA regulations (or equivalent competent authority in ex-US countries where the preclinical studies and clinical trials may be conducted). DEA requirements for State and Federal DEA Registration for receipt, storage and dispensing of controlled substances vary from state to state and the DEA Registration process can be lengthy and requirement multiple site visits by DEA personnel. This is further complicated if the controlled substance needs temperature regulation as well as controlled access / storage. Failure to gain or delay to gaining the necessary DEA registrations at one or more non-clinical (CMC), laboratory or manufacturing or packaging or labelling sites. preclinical study sites, analytical laboratories or clinical trial sites may delay the delivery of materials to key stakeholders. For example, delay of delivery of investigational product to a clinical trial site, may ultimately delay the initiation, conduct or completion of clinical trials critical for the approval of the product. These failures or delays may delay also the development of other drug candidates and hinder our ability to develop and / or conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, if we have failures or delays in DEA registrations in pivotal or critical programs, we may also be expected to experience challenges, delays or even the inability to obtain additional financing at acceptable terms and conditions to develop these or other drug candidates.
 
If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) are deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate for its intended use, and the preclinical and quality data are also acceptable, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA, a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the US FDA seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We have not completed our non-clinical (CMC) studies or preclinical studies or clinical trials for any candidate drug for any intended use and therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filing.
 
The purpose of the NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether the candidate drug has a positive benefit / risk profile and whether it should approve the drug candidate for marketing for specific intended uses.
 
The fact that the FDA has previously granted a candidate drug an IND, or designated a drug as an orphan drug for a specific intended use, or granted it Breakthrough status, or fast track status or an expedited review does not mean that the drug has been approved for marketing. Only after an NDA has been approved by the FDA is marketing allowed. A request for orphan drug status (orphan drug designation) must be filed before the NDA is filed. The orphan drug designation, though, provides certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity subject to certain exceptions.
 
The NDA normally includes, but is not limited to, sections describing the quality safety and efficacy of the medicine. The quality section describes the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, the preclinical (non-clinical) section describes the non-clinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, , and the clinical section describes the efficacy and safety results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate drug. Importantly for drug candidates containing controlled substances, studies investigating the medicine’s potential for abuse are also undertaken and reported.
 
We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic drug in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug. Government regulation may delay or prevent
 

9
-


marketing of potential drugs for a considerable period and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our drugs on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a drug receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the drug / medicine. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further studies which may be additional preclinical studies or clinical trials (e.g. Phase IV trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved drug as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the drug’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the drug from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against the company.
 
As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved drugs, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of drugs that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved drug or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced listed drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the NDA. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new drug must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new drug. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its drugs only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its drugs may be commercialized.
 
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such drugs prior to providing approval to market a drug.
 
Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, orphan drug designation may nevertheless be available if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, a drug that has received orphan drug designation is eligible for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for
 

10
--


certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act provides that, if a designated drug is approved for the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the approved drug will be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA generally will not approve any other application for a drug containing the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Products that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan products may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population. Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan- designated products as for other drugs. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Europe
 
The drug development process in Europe is essentially the same as that required to develop drugs in an acceptable manner, in that a drug must meet the requirements for quality safety and efficacy. The international regulators (including the FDA) have a system which allows them to mutually recognize the standards of drug development. This is called the ICH standard (international Conference on Harmonization). This avoids the need for pharmaceutical companies to repeat their costly drug development programs for different jurisidctions / international territories. There are nuances between the requirements of the USA, Europe and Japan – but the standards to which development programs must be conducted are essentially the same.
 
There are essentially three mechanisms for obtaining a marketing authorization (MA) in Europe
 

1) | the Centralized Procedure
---+--------------------------


2) | the De-Centralized Procedure
---+-----------------------------


3) | the Mutual Recognition Procedure
---+---------------------------------

Centralized Procedure (CP)
 The advantage of the centralized procedure is that it requires a single application which, if successful, results in a single marketing authorization with the same product information available in all EU languages and valid in all EU member states / countries, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The scientific assessment of the marketing authorization application is carried out by the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). The scientific review process consists of alternating periods of active evaluation and periods during which the clock is stopped in order to give the applicant time to resolve any issues identified during the evaluation. In total, the duration of the process is up to 210 ‘active’ days before an opinion is issued by the CHMP. Once an opinion has been given, it is forwarded to the European Commission which then has 67 days to issue a legally binding decision on the marketing authorization.
 
Once a marketing authorization has been granted, the applicant can start to market the medicine in any EU Member State of its choice. However, in practice before a medicine is marketed, it will be subject to pricing negotiations and a review of its cost-effectiveness. This is carried out at national level by Member States to determine reimbursement criteria. Initially, the centralized procedure was mandatory only for biotechnology medicines, as was the case with the previous concertation procedure. Over time, however, the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure has been gradually expanded and by 2005, it included orphan medicines (medicines for rare diseases) as well as human medicines that contain a new active substance (not previously authorized in the Union before 20 November 2005) and that are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. In 2009, the centralized procedure also became mandatory for advanced therapy medicines. The centralized procedure is also optional for other medicines that contain a new active substance not authorized in the Union before 20 November 2005, and for products which are considered to be a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or for which an EU-wide authorization is considered to be in the interests of public health.

The Decentralized Procedure (DCP)
 In the decentralized procedure, the applicant chooses one country as the reference Member State when making its application for marketing authorization. The chosen reference Member State then prepares a draft assessment report that is submitted to the other Member States where approval is sought for their simultaneous consideration and approval. In allowing the other Member States access to this assessment at an early stage, any issues and concerns can be dealt with quickly without delay, which sometimes is known to occur with the mutual recognition procedure (MRP, see below). Compared with the MRP, the decentralized procedure has the advantage that the marketing authorization in all chosen Member States is received simultaneously, enabling simultaneous marketing of the medicine and reducing the administrative and regulatory burden.
The Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP)
 The mutual recognition procedure has been in place since 1995 and evolved from the multi-state licensing procedure. The applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU Member State, referred to as the “Reference Member State” (RMS) and then seek approval for the medicine in other, so-called ‘Concerned Member States’ in a second step based on the assessment done in the RMS. This process has significant differences from the former multi-state licensing procedure, notably the requirement that disagreements between Member States must now be resolved at EU level. Disagreements are handled by the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures – Human (CMDh), a body representing Member States, which is responsible for any questions in two or more Member States relating to the Marketing Authorization (MA) of a medicinal product approved through the mutual recognition or the decentralized procedure. If there is a disagreement between Member States on grounds of a potential serious risk to public health, the CMDh considers the matter in order to reach an agreement within 60 days. If resolution is not possible by the CMDh, the procedure is referred to the CHMP in a procedure called a referral. The CHMP will then carry out a scientific assessment of the relevant medicine on behalf of the EU. In contrast to the previous (multi-state) procedure, the outcome of the CHMP is binding on the Member States involved once it has been adopted by the European Commission. The timelines for assessment by CHMP is 60 days. Since the introduction of the decentralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure is used for extending existing marketing authorizations to other countries.
 
There are other nuances to Marketing Authorization approval of medicines in Europe compared with the FDA. For example a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained through studies in children, to support the authorization of a medicine for children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver.
 
Orphan Drug Designation in Europe
 
In the European Union, it is also possible to obtain an orphan drug designation for a pipeline drug candidate. This also entitles a company to financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The definition of what qualifies as a rare disease in Europe is slightly different to the USA definition.
 
To qualify for orphan designation in Europe, a medicine must meet a number of criteria:
 

• | it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As with the USA, European Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
In the same way that there is no guarantee than any medicines developed by Alterola will be approved in the USA, there is similarly no guarantee that any of Alterola’s medicines will be approved in Europe.

Food, Drinks & Dietary Supplements
 
USA
 According to the FDA, it is currently illegal to market THC or CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that THC and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)]. Under that provision, if a substance (such as THC or CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 355], or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. FDA considers a substance to be "authorized for investigation as a new drug" if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under FDA’s regulations (21 CFR 312.2), unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
 
There is an exception to section 201(ff)(3)(B) if the substance was "marketed as" a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the drug was approved or before the new drug investigations were authorized, as applicable. However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for THC or CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusions that THC and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act. FDA continues to review information that is submitted to FDA on this issue, but to date this has not caused FDA to change their conclusions.
 
Given the legal / regulatory situation at present in the USA, at this time, Alterola will not be looking to commercialize cannabinoid-containing ingredients or products in the food, drinks or dietary supplements sector in the USA.
 
Europe - Novel Food Application (Europe)
 
Under EU regulations, any food that was not consumed “significantly” prior to May 1997 is considered to be a “Novel Food”. The category covers new foods, food from new sources, new substances used in food as well as new ways and technologies for producing food. There is a specific procedure for gaining a Novel Food Approval in Europe.
 
The novel food status of CBD extracts was confirmed in January 2019. This means that applicants need to apply for authorisation of CBD extracts and isolates using the procedure for full applications (rather than a traditional food) outlined in the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) guidance.
 
In general, the process is as follows: (1) The applicant submits a Novel Food application; (2) the application is reviewed and if compliant validated by the European Commission to see if it falls within the scope of Novel Food Regulation (EU) 2015 / 2283 (EC validity check); (3) the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) undertakes a suitability check to see if the application fulfils the requirements of article 10(2) of (EU) 2015 / 2283; (4) EFSA reviews and performs a risk assessment and gives an opinion within 9 months of receipt of a valid application (5) the EC drafts an implementing act authorizing the placement on the market of a Novel Food and updating the EU list, within 7 months of the EFSA opinion. This process can take approximately 18 months from receipt of a valid application, although it can take longer in some cases.
 
Given the legal and regulated process in Europe, Alterola intends to submit Novel Food applications for cannabinoid-containing ingredients and / or products in the food, drinks or dietary supplements sector in Europe, where it is legal to do so. It may be several years before we can obtain approval and commence commercialization of such ingredients, if ever.

 Given the varying legal and regulated processes for regulatory approval of for cannabinoid-containing ingredients and / or products in the food, drinks or dietary supplements sector in countries outside of the USA and Europe, Alterola will consider gaining such approval in countries / territories where it is legal to do so. These will be considered on a case-by-case basis as appropriate. It may be several years before we can obtain approval and commence commercialization of such ingredients, if ever.
 
Cosmetics
 
USA
 A cosmetic is defined in the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act 201(i) as "(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap."
 
Under the FD&C Act, cosmetic products and ingredients are not subject to premarket approval by FDA, except for most color additives. Certain cosmetic ingredients are prohibited or restricted by regulation, but currently that is not the case for any cannabis or cannabis-derived ingredients. Ingredients not specifically addressed by regulation must nonetheless comply with all applicable requirements, and no ingredient – including a cannabis or cannabis-derived ingredient – cannot be used in a cosmetic if it causes the product to be adulterated or misbranded in any way. A cosmetic generally is adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to users under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual (section 601(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 361(a)]).
 
Alterola may choose to supply active ingredient(s) to cosmetic companies within the USA where it is legal to do so. However, although the company is focussed upon producing low cost of goods ingredients, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to produce cosmetic ingredients at the purity required of at a cost of goods which will enable the company to compete within other suppliers of cosmetic ingredients to cosmetic companies. Alterola has no intention in producing its own cosmetic products. It may be several years before we can obtain approval and commence commercialization of such ingredients, if ever.
 
Europe
 The use of CBD in cosmetics is harmonised within the European Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 , under entry 306 ‘Narcotics, natural and synthetic’ of Annex II , and has been for some time. The regulation prohibits use of cannabis and cannabis extracts in cosmetics, as they are controlled substances in Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, CBD specifically is not referenced in this convention. At the beginning of 2019, the European Commission (EC) added two entries to its database of cosmetics ingredients for CBD to differentiate between: CBD “derived from extract or tincture or resin of cannabis” and CBD “synthetically produced”. Both entries contain the same text: “Cannabidiol (CBD) as such, irrespective of its source, is not listed in the Schedules of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, it shall be prohibited from use in cosmetic products (II/306) if it is prepared as an extract or tincture or resin of Cannabis in accordance with the Single Convention. Please note that national legislations on controlled substances may also apply.” Essentially, use of naturally-derived CBD from cannabis plants is prohibited in the EU but use of hemp-derived or synthetically-produced CBD is allowed. However, the Single Convention’s banned ingredients list does not include cannabis seeds or leaves without tops, meaning use of CBD derived from these parts of the cannabis plant is not currently prohibited.
 
It is Alterola’s intention to supply active ingredient(s) to cosmetic companies within the EU where it is legal to do so. However, although the company is focussed upon producing low cost of goods ingredients, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to produce cosmetic ingredients at the purity required of at a cost of goods which will enable the company to compete within other suppliers of cosmetic ingredients to cosmetic companies. Alterola has no intention in producing its own cosmetic products. It may be several years before we can obtain approval and commence commercialization of such ingredients, if ever.
