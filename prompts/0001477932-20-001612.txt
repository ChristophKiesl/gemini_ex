The Company distributes high-quality, predominantly domestically-manufactured, technically complex, nut and bolt products and a proprietary locking washer product that are used primarily for industrial/commercial applications that require a high level of certified and assured quality. Additionally, the Company manufactures specialty stainless steel, and related products for steel mills, steel forging operations, and various metal fabrication facilities.
 
The Company’s operations are carried out through its wholly-owned distribution subsidiary Creative Assembly Systems, Inc.

Industry Overview and Competition
 
The fastener distribution industry is highly fragmented. No one company holds a dominant position. This is primarily caused by the varied uses of fasteners and the size of the industry. Amerinac competes with the numerous fastener distributors which serve as authorized stocking distributors for one or more of the manufacturers in the Company’s supplier base. Amerinac believes that the depth of its inventory represents a competitive advantage. As a stocking distributor, the Company has employed a business model of maintaining levels of inventory on hand or on order with its suppliers that can satisfy its customers’ projected needs. The demanding quality, inspection, tracking and re-inspection requirements, part certifications and customer qualifications imposed on distributors of industrial fasteners by major consumers create a barrier to entry.
 
In addition to competing against other distributors, the company believes it faces competition from end users creating their own supply chain management.
 
The company believes its competitive attributes are as follows:
 

• | The Company’s quality system is certified to Rev. C, AS9100D, ISO 9001:2015 and PED quality measures. Since quality is an important measure of industrial suppliers, the Company strives to maintain its quality system to the highest standards in the industry. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | As an authorized stocking distributor for the premier domestic manufacturers, the Company is able to maintain relationships with customers not generally available to the industry. Many manufacturers in the past several years have consolidated their network of authorized distributors.

 
The steel foundry industry is a diverse industry. This is primarily caused by the varied sizes and shapes of metal produced, as well as, the numerous grades and quality of steel required for the end use applications. PMAL competes with the numerous mills in the United States and internationally. PMAL’s customers sell products into automotive, aerospace, medical device, as well as other industries. PMAL believes that its nimble and flexible production capabilities, and consistent high level of quality, provide competitive advantages. PMAL believes that the fixed costs needed for new entrants to the steel foundry market create very significant barriers to entry.
