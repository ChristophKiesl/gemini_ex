Item 1. Business
 Take-private transaction
 On October 16, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Omega Acquisition, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), an entity owned by the Company’s founder, Harold G. Hamm. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on November 22, 2022 Merger Sub completed a tender offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock for $74.28 per share in cash, other than: (i) shares of common stock owned by Mr. Hamm, certain of his family members and their affiliated entities (collectively, the “Hamm Family”) and (ii) shares of common stock underlying unvested equity awards issued pursuant to the Company’s long-term incentive plans. Immediately prior to the consummation of the Offer, Mr. Hamm contributed 100% of the capital stock of Merger Sub to the Company, as a result of which Merger Sub became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Following consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation wholly owned by the Hamm Family.
Following the completion of the transaction: (i) our common stock ceased to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange effective November 23, 2022, (ii) our common stock was deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and (iii) we suspended our reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As a result, certain of the corporate governance, disclosure, and other provisions applicable to a company with listed equity securities and reporting obligations under the Exchange Act no longer apply to us. We will continue to furnish Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K with the SEC as required by our senior note indentures.

 Nature of business
 We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company formed in 1967 engaged in the exploration, development, management, and production of crude oil and natural gas and associated products with properties primarily located in four leading basins in the United States – the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana, the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, the Permian Basin of Texas, and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in certain of our key operating areas.
We focus our activities in large crude oil and natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions and apply our geologic and operational expertise to drill and develop properties at attractive rates of return. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation), pad/row development, and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. Additionally, our operations have also grown in recent years from strategic acquisitions.
As of December 31, 2022, our proved reserves were 1,864 MMBoe, with proved developed reserves representing 1,035 MMBoe, or 56%, of our total proved reserves. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled $31.91 billion at December 31, 2022. For 2022, we generated crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues of $10.1 billion and operating cash flows of $7.0 billion. Crude oil accounted for 50% of our total production and 69% of our crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues for 2022. Our total production averaged 401,800 Boe per day for 2022, an increase of 22% compared to 2021.

The table below summarizes our total proved reserves, PV-10 (non-GAAP) and net producing wells as of December 31, 2022 and our average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 for our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $8.05 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.
 Our Business Strategies
 Our business strategies continue to be focused on increasing enterprise value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at low costs and attractive rates of return. For 2023, our primary business strategies will include:
 •Continuing to exercise capital and operational discipline to maximize cash flow generation and competitive returns on capital employed; 
 •Reducing outstanding debt and maintaining a strong balance sheet to enhance financial flexibility;
 •Maintaining low-cost, capital efficient operations; and
 •Driving continued improvement in our health, safety, and environmental performance and governance programs.
 Our Business Strengths
 We have a number of strengths to allow us to successfully execute our business strategies, including the following:
 Large acreage inventory with access to both crude oil and natural gas resources. We held 605,179 net undeveloped acres and 1.52 million net developed acres under lease as of December 31, 2022 concentrated in core areas of premier U.S. resource plays that provide optionality and access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.
Expertise with pad and row development, horizontal drilling, and optimized completion methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and optimized completion methods and continue to be among industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad and row development strategies. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. We have also been among industry leaders in testing and utilizing optimized completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage spacing to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties.
Control operations over a substantial portion of our assets and investments. As of December 31, 2022, we operated properties comprising 88% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used. Additionally, we capitalize on our geologic knowledge and land expertise to strategically acquire minerals in areas of future growth, thereby allowing us to enhance cash flows and project economics through the alignment of mineral ownership with our drilling schedule. Further, we continue to grow our significant portfolio of water gathering, recycling, and disposal infrastructure assets which

allow for uninterrupted flow back and recycling capabilities, supports timely completion activities, and generates additional service revenues and cash flows.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry and with operating in challenging commodity price environments. Our Executive Chairman, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 7 executive officers have an average of 40 years of oil and gas industry experience.
 Financial Position and Liquidity. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.255 billion that matures in October 2026. We had approximately $1.12 billion of borrowing availability on our credit facility at February 1, 2023 after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
 Proved Reserves
 Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole, production, seismic, and well test data.
 The table below sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2022. Proved reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to our consolidated reserves and are not separately presented herein. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $31.91 billion at December 31, 2022. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2022 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 98% of our PV-10 and 98% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2022 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2022 through December 2022, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $93.67 per Bbl for crude oil and $6.36 per MMBtu for natural gas ($89.47 per Bbl for crude oil and $6.12 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials).
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves by commodity and reserve classification as of December 31, 2022.

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions for 2022 are comprised of (i) upward price revisions of 29 MMBo and 105 Bcf (totaling 46 MMBoe) due to an increase in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2022 compared to 2021, (ii) the removal of 35 MMBo and 225 Bcf (totaling 72 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to continual refinement of our drilling and development programs and reallocation of capital to areas providing the best opportunities to improve efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return, (iii) downward revisions of 71 MMBo and 401 Bcf (totaling 137 MMBoe) from the removal of PUD reserves due to changes in anticipated well densities, economics, performance, and other factors, and (iv) downward revisions for oil reserves of 9 MMBo and upward revisions for natural gas reserves of 236 Bcf (netting to 31 MMBoe of upward revisions) due to changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors.
 Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were due to successful drilling and completion activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs. For 2022, proved reserve additions totaled 109 MMBoe in the Bakken, 154 MMBoe in the Anadarko Basin, 18 MMBoe in the Powder River Basin, and 114 MMBoe in the Permian Basin. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2022 drilling activities.
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of proved reserves in the past three years.
Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin as discussed in Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property Acquisitions. We had no individually significant acquisitions of proved reserves in 2020.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2022 are located in our most active development areas. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2022 include 84 MMBoe of reserves associated with wells where drilling has occurred but the wells have not been completed or are completed but not producing ("DUC wells"). Our DUC wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete and produce from the wells.

Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2022 | | 435,240 | | | 2,358,578 | | 828,336 | 

 
Revisions of previous estimates. As previously discussed, in 2022 we removed 35 MMBo and 225 Bcf (totaling 72 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to continual refinement of our drilling and development programs and reallocation of capital to areas providing the best opportunities to improve efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return. Additionally, changes in anticipated well densities, economics, performance, and other factors resulted in downward PUD reserve revisions of 71 MMBo and 401 Bcf (totaling 137 MMBoe) in 2022. The increases in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2022 resulted in upward price revisions of 6 MMBoe and 24 Bcf (totaling 10 MMBoe). Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors resulted in upward revisions for PUD reserves of 4 MMBo and 31 Bcf (totaling 9 MMBoe) in 2022.
 Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions were due to successful drilling activities and continual refinement of our drilling and development programs. For 2022, PUD reserve additions totaled 68 MMBo and 227 Bcf in the Bakken, 27 MMBo and 643 Bcf in the Anadarko Basin, 7 MMBo and 14 Bcf in the Powder River Basin, and 72 MMBo and 149 Bcf in the Permian Basin.
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of PUD reserves in 2022.
 Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases in 2022 were primarily attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin as discussed in Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property Acquisitions. 
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2022, we developed approximately 21% of our PUD locations and 17% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2021 through the drilling and completion of 383 gross (150 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately $892 million incurred in 2022.
Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in our key operating areas. Our drilling programs to date in our historical operating areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, including our drilled but not completed locations. Our inventory of DUC wells classified as PUDs total 317 gross (118 net) operated and non-operated locations at December 31, 2022 and represent 10% of our PUD reserves at that date. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2022 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans.
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves at December 31, 2022 are projected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2023, $1.7 billion in 2024, $2.6 billion in 2025, $2.1 billion in 2026, and $1.7 billion in 2027. These capital expenditure projections have been established based on an expectation of drilling and completion costs, available cash flows, borrowing capacity, and the commodity price environment in effect at the time of preparing our reserve estimates and may be adjusted as market conditions evolve. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2022 is expected to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be drilled within five years of initial booking because of changes in business strategy or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2022. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2022 that remain undrilled beyond five years from the date of initial booking.

 The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the largest crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are the largest producer and leasehold owner in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 1.2 million gross (746,900 net) acres under lease in the Bakken field.
Our total Bakken production averaged 174,397 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2022, down 1% from the 2021 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our average daily Bakken production increased 1% compared to 2021. In 2022, we participated in the drilling and completion of 266 gross (93 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 252 gross (102 net) wells in 2021.
Our Bakken properties represented 39% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2022 and 42% of our average daily Boe production for the 2022 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2022 were 734 MMBoe, an increase of 4% compared to December 31, 2021. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 1,173 gross (596 net) wells as of December 31, 2022.
Anadarko Basin
 We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, which includes the SCOOP and STACK areas of the play. As of December 31, 2022, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Anadarko Basin with approximately 841,400 gross (473,300 net) acres under lease.
Our properties in the Anadarko Basin represented 37% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 40% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2022. Production in the Anadarko Basin averaged 165,225 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2022, up 13% compared to the 2021 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2022, average daily production in the Anadarko Basin increased 7% compared to 2021. We participated in the drilling and completion of 155 gross (44 net) wells in the Anadarko Basin during 2022 compared to 161 gross (63 net) wells in 2021.
Our proved reserves in the Anadarko Basin as of December 31, 2022 totaled 697 MMBoe, an increase of 3% compared to December 31, 2021. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Anadarko Basin totaled 312 gross (159 net) wells as of December 31, 2022.
Powder River Basin
 In 2021, we executed strategic acquisitions to expand our operations into the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and subsequently completed additional acquisitions in the play in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 530,500 gross (377,800 net) acres under lease in the play.
Table of Contents

Our Powder River properties represented 6% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2022 and 7% of our average daily Boe production for the 2022 fourth quarter. Our production in the Powder River Basin averaged 28,057 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 290% compared to the 2021 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our average daily Powder River production increased 377% compared to 2021, reflecting new acquisitions and additional drilling and completion activities in 2022. During 2022, we participated in the drilling and completion of 31 gross (23 net) wells in the play compared to 10 gross (8 net) wells in 2021.
Our proved reserves in the Powder River Basin totaled 104 MMBoe as of December 31, 2022 compared to 32 MMBoe at December 31, 2021, and our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the play totaled 96 gross (57 net) wells at year-end 2022.
Permian Basin
 On December 21, 2021, we executed a strategic acquisition to expand our operations into the Permian Basin of Texas. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 239,600 gross (187,700 net) acres under lease in the play.
Our Permian properties represented 16% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2022 and 11% of our average daily Boe production for the 2022 fourth quarter. Our production in the Permian Basin averaged 44,925 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our average daily Permian production totaled 41,917 Boe per day. During 2022, we participated in the drilling and completion of 39 gross (35 net) wells in the play.
Our proved reserves in the Permian Basin totaled 304 MMBoe as of December 31, 2022 compared to 203 MMBoe at December 31, 2021, and our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the play totaled 261 gross (237 net) wells at year-end 2022.

Title to Properties
 As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records and production databases to determine fee mineral ownership and availability. Title, lease forms and terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation.
For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain physical well site inspections, and examine the seller’s internal records (land, legal, operational, production, environmental, well, marketing and accounting) upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. Company landmen may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties.
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, Company landmen procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title issues, if any. Company landmen will not approve commencement of drilling operations until material title defects pertaining to the Company’s interest are cured.
The Company has cured material title opinion issues as to Company interests on substantially all of its producing properties and believes it holds at least defensible title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The Company’s crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which do not materially interfere with the Company’s interest in the properties or affect the Company’s carrying value of such properties.
Marketing
 We sell most of our operated crude oil production to crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. In the Bakken, Powder River, Permian, SCOOP, and STACK areas we have significant volumes of production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining production primarily transported by truck to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery. We do not transport any of our oil production prior to sale by rail, but several purchasers of our Bakken production are connected to rail delivery systems and may choose those methods to transport the oil they have purchased from us. We sell some operated crude oil production at the lease. Our share of crude oil production from non-operated properties is marketed at the discretion of the operators.
Table of Contents

We sell most of our operated natural gas and natural gas liquids production to midstream customers at our lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur, with the remaining production sold at centrally gathered locations or natural gas processing plants. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedications. Under certain arrangements, we have the right to take a volume of processed residue gas and/or natural gas liquids ("NGLs") in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream customer's processing plant in lieu of a monetary settlement for the sale of our operated natural gas production. When we do take volumes in kind, we pay third parties to transport the volumes taken in kind to downstream delivery points, where we then sell to customers at prices applicable to those downstream markets. Sales at the downstream markets are mostly under daily and monthly packaged volumes deals, shorter term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of products we elect to take in-kind in lieu of monetary settlement for our leasehold sales. Our share of natural gas and NGL production from non-operated properties is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for crude oil and natural gas properties, minerals, and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, supply chain disruptions in recent years have led to shortages of certain materials and equipment and increased costs. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased. Finally, the emerging impact of climate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in energy generation devices may result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.
Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the frequent imposition of new or increased requirements. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on our operations and may increase the cost of doing business and reduce our profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us materially different than they will affect our similarly situated competitors.
 The following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
 Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
 Our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil are subject to anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). These laws, among other things, prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we can be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
 We transport most of our operated crude oil production to market centers using a combination of trucks and pipeline transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by pipeline. Further, our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, the regulation of such transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.

Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
 From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), an agency of the United Nations, has issued regulations requiring the maritime shipping industry to gradually reduce its carbon emissions over time by mandating a 1% improvement in the efficiency of fleets each year between 2015 and 2025. In conjunction with this initiative, the IMO issued regulations requiring ship owners to lower the concentration of the sulfur content used in their fuels from 3.5% to 0.5% beginning on January 1, 2020. To achieve and maintain compliance with the new regulations, it is expected ship owners will either have to switch to more expensive higher quality marine fuel, install and utilize emissions-cleaning systems, or switch to alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas. Failure to comply with the regulations may result in fines or shipping vessels being detained, thereby resulting in exportation capacity constraints that inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell domestic crude oil production overseas, which may have a material impact on the markets and prices for various grades of domestic and international crude oil. The ultimate long-term impact of the IMO regulations is uncertain.
We do not own or operate pipeline or rail transportation facilities, rail cars, or infrastructure used to facilitate the exportation of crude oil. However, regulations that impact the domestic transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.
 Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
 We are also required to observe the aforementioned anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC in connection with physical sales of natural gas and any derivative instruments relating to natural gas. Additionally, the FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to increase competition and make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis and has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by the FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
 The gathering of natural gas, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the potential to increase costs for our purchasers and reduce the revenues we receive for our natural gas stream. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. We do not believe such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
 Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
 The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices and could inhibit the development of LNG infrastructure.
 Regulation of production
 The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Each of the states
Table of Contents

where we own and operate properties have laws and regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These laws and regulations directly and indirectly limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill, although we can and do apply for exceptions to such laws and regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
 The failure to comply with the above laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same laws, rules, and regulations as we are.
 Environmental regulation
 General. We are subject to stringent, complex, and overlapping federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:
 •require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;
 •restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transportation activities;
 •limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;
 •require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and
 •impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.
 These laws, rules and regulations may restrict the level of substances generated by our operations that may be emitted into the air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or otherwise released to surface and below-ground soils and groundwater, and may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production to a rate that is economically infeasible for continued production. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, in the name of combatting climate change, President Biden has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders that result in more stringent and costly requirements for the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry, or which restrict, delay or ban oil and gas permitting or leasing on federal lands. Any regulatory or executive changes that impose further requirements on domestic producers for emissions control, waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation could have a significant impact on our operating costs and production of oil and gas. Failure to comply with these and other laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation in a particular area. Additionally, certain of these environmental laws may result in imposition of joint and several or strict liability, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners or other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Certain environmental laws also provide for certain citizen suits, which allow persons or organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental laws. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The following is a description of some of the environmental laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that apply to our operations.
 Air emissions. Federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations have been and, in the future, will likely be enacted to address concerns about emissions of regulated air pollutants. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit standards or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. For example, in October 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) announced its intention to initiate a rule-making to reassess and lower, by the end of 2023, the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone, which was last set by the EPA under the Obama Administration in 2015. State implementation of a revised NAAQS for ground-level ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, or result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.

Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries and, as a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases as well as to reduce, restrict, or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases.
 Federal regulatory initiatives have focused on establishing construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. Following attempts from the Trump Administration to revise standards related to the emission of methane from the oil and gas sectors, the Biden Administration has taken several steps to impose more stringent controls on methane emissions. For example, in November 2021 the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish new source (“Quad Ob”) and first-time existing source (“Quad Oc”) standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions in the crude oil and natural gas source category. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operation and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to this proposed rulemaking in November 2022 that, among other items, sets forth specific revisions strengthening the first nationwide emission guidelines for states to limit methane emissions from existing crude oil and natural gas facilities. The proposal also revises requirements for fugitive emissions monitoring and repair as well as equipment leaks and the frequency of monitoring surveys, establishes a “super-emitter” response program to timely mitigate emissions events as detected by governmental agencies or qualified third parties. Additionally, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA 2022”) was signed into law. This law, among other provisions, amends the federal Clean Air Act to establish the first ever federal fee on methane emissions from sources required to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA, including certain oil and gas operations. The methane emissions charge will start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025, and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and subsequent years. Calculation of the methane fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA 2022. The IRA 2022 additionally appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives. The methane emissions fee could increase our operating costs, and the funding and incentives established for renewable energy sources could accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, which could in turn reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement among participating nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. As part of the U.S.’s obligations under the Paris Agreement, the Biden Administration has announced a goal of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions 50%-52% by 2030. Moreover, in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”), multiple announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain measures perceived to subsidize fossil fuel production and consumption, and to pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 counties joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States' commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.
 Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions has given rise to increasing federal political risk for the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry. In the United States, President Biden has issued several executive orders calling for more expansive action to address climate change and suspend new oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. The suspension of the federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide permanent injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in August 2022, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other parties have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose those impacts.

Moreover, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Stockholders and bondholders currently invested in energy companies but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to energy companies have also focused on sustainability lending practices that favor alternative power sources perceived to be more clean (despite their negative impacts on the environment), such as wind and solar. Some of these investors may elect not to provide traditional funding for energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting or eliminating access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. In November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Subsequently, in September 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that six of the largest banks in the U.S. will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise, expected to be launched in early 2023, to enhance the ability of firms and supervisors to measure and mange climate-related financial risk. While we cannot predict what policies may result from this, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could reduce demand for our products.
 Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, including the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota law permits flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well’s first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well.
In addition, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans setting forth plans taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. The NDIC currently requires us to capture 91% of the natural gas produced from a field. We capture in excess of the NDIC requirement. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficient rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells is not permitted to exceed 100 barrels of crude oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider temporary exemptions from the foregoing restrictions or for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this regulation if an operator fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. Ongoing compliance with the NDIC’s flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
 We seek to reduce or eliminate natural gas flaring, but our efforts may not always be successful or cost-effective. Our levels of flaring are impacted by external factors such as investment from third parties in the development and continued operation of gas gathering and processing facilities and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. Increased emissions from our facilities due to flaring could subject our facilities to more stringent air emission permitting requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs and potential construction delays.
 Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies or to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies have studied the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would potentially increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance related to such activities. Also, the EPA has issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. We do not discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this regulation on us is not currently, and is not expected to be, material.

In late 2016 the EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources in which the EPA indicated it found evidence that such activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA’s study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.
In 2016, the BLM under the Obama Administration published final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule in November 2018. Litigation challenging the BLM’s 2016 final rule as well as its 2018 final rule rescinding the 2016 rule has been pursued by various states and industry and environmental groups. While a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020 and, accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no longer in effect. However, appeals to those decisions are ongoing. Additionally, in 2022 the BLM proposed rules that would limit flaring from well sites on federal lands, as well as allow for the delay or denial of permits if the BLM finds that an operator's methane waste minimization plan is insufficient. This rule is currently receiving public comments and, if finalized, may also be subject to legal challenge. Notwithstanding these recent legal developments, further administrative and regulatory restrictions may be adopted by the Biden Administration that could restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands and waters.
In addition, regulators in states in which we operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) has promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and natural gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The OCC’s guidance provides for seismic monitoring and for implementation of mitigation procedures, which may include curtailment or even suspension of operations in the event of concurrent seismic events within a particular radius of operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. If seismic events exceeding the OCC guidance thresholds were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
 Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have investigated whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. To address concerns regarding seismicity, some states, including states in which we operate, have pursued remedies that included delaying permit approvals, mandating a reduction in injection volumes, or shutting down or imposing moratoria on the use of injection wells. Moreover, regulators in states in which we operate have implemented additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the OCC has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma utilizes a “traffic light” system wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA’s current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA’s future actions in this regard.
The introduction of new environmental laws and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by oil and gas producers and we do not expect the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In recent years, we have increased our operation and use of water recycling and distribution facilities that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
 We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
