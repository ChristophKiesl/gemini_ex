Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
PGT Innovations, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PGTI” or the “Company”) manufactures and supplies premium windows and doors and fully customizable overhead garage doors, with the recent acquisition of Martin Door Holdings, Inc. (“Martin”) effective on October 14, 2022. Our impact-resistant products can withstand some of the toughest weather conditions on earth and, with our Western Window Systems (“WWS”) product lines, unify indoor/outdoor living spaces. We strive to create value through deep customer relationships, understanding the needs of the markets we serve, and a drive to develop category-defining products. We believe we are one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of impact-resistant windows and doors and hold leadership positions in our primary markets. We manufacture diverse lines of products, intended to appeal to different segments of the market, at different price-points, including high-end, luxury, premium and mass-custom fully customizable aluminum and vinyl windows and doors and porch enclosure products, targeting both the residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets. We market our impact-resistant products under five recognized brands: PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI® Windows and Doors, WinDoor®, NewSouth Window Solutions®, and Eco Enterprises, Inc. We believe all of these brands are positively associated with service, performance, quality, durability and energy efficiency. We also market a line of window and door products designed to unify indoor/outdoor living spaces under the two recognized brands of Western Window Systems® and Anlin®, which we believe are associated with innovation, quality, durability and energy efficiency in the indoor/outdoor living space markets. With the acquisition of Martin, we have added premium overhead garage doors to our product portfolio, entering into a building product adjacent to the window and door market, and further expanding our western geographic footprint.

On October 14, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Martin Door Holdings, Inc. (the "Martin Acquisition"). Headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT, Martin is a leading custom manufacturer of premium overhead garage doors and hardware serving the Western U.S. residential and commercial markets. The acquisition was done by WWS Acquisition, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company, and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PGT Innovations, Inc. Martin will operate under the Western Division of PGTI.
 Our impact-resistant products combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to ensure structural integrity, which provides protection from wind-driven projectiles of all sizes and other debris during a storm. Our impact-resistant products substantially reduce the likelihood of penetration by impacting projectiles, protecting people and property, while providing expansive, unblocked exterior views that other forms of protection, such as shutters or wood coverings, do not provide. Our impact-resistant products also offer many other benefits, including: (1) abatement of sound to substantially decrease outside noise, including during hurricanes; (2) protection against the damaging effects of ultra-violet light; (3) reduction of energy loss due to changing external temperatures; and (4) energy efficiency that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs, as evidenced by the energy ratings our products have received. These impact-resistant products satisfy the nation’s most stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other “active” forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. We also manufacture vinyl porch and patio enclosure products under our Eze-Breeze ® brand, that are designed to allow air flow while protecting against inclement weather, making outdoor spaces more inviting.
 The acquisition of NewSouth has supported our diversification into growing segments in the window and door industry, by enabling us to enter the direct-to-consumer channel, where NewSouth is a market leader in Florida. NewSouth's direct-to-consumer model is supported by its showrooms and in-home sales. With the addition of NewSouth, we continued our strategy of growing in geographic areas outside of our core markets, with showrooms throughout the southern states.
 The acquisition of Eco extended our residential market footprint with what we believe will be minimal overlap with our existing network of dealers, as most of Eco’s dealer-customers have not historically been our customers. Eco’s product offerings in the commercial market are expected to provide us with added product and customer diversification in that space, which we believe will be a high-growth market in future periods. By adding Eco’s glass manufacturing capabilities to our operations, we expanded our glass production capabilities and capacity in order to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass.
 The additions of Anlin and Western Window Systems (“WWS”) to our family of brands expanded our portfolio of offerings and our geographical footprint and added award-winning and innovative products that combine performance and quality with clean, functional designs. Those products are designed for strength, easy integration into a variety of spaces, smooth operation and are tested for durability.
 With the addition of Martin, we expanded into an adjacent window and door category by adding premium overhead garage doors to our product portfolio, and broadened our geographic footprint and brand presence in the high-growth Western region. Martin adds another recognized brand to our portfolio of brands, and we believe will open cross-selling opportunities for existing Western division brands and NewSouth Window Solutions.

With approximately 5,500 employees (as of December 31, 2022) at our various manufacturing facilities located in North Venice, Tampa, and Fort Myers, on the west coast of Florida, and Hialeah and Medley, on the east coast of Florida, as well as Phoenix, Arizona, Irvine and Clovis, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah, in the western U.S., our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities include in-house glass cutting, tempering, laminating and insulating capabilities, which provide us with a consistent source of specialized glass, shorter lead times, lower costs relative to third-party sourcing and an overall more efficient production process. Additionally, our manufacturing process relies on just-in-time delivery of raw materials and components as well as synchronous flow to promote labor efficiency and throughput, allowing us to more consistently fulfill orders on-time for our valued customers.
The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Western U.S., Gulf Coast, and the Coastal mid-Atlantic. We also ship to the Caribbean, Central America and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including nearly 4,000 independently-owned dealers and distributors, national building supply distributors, the in-home sales/custom order divisions of major U.S. home building and improvement supply retailers and, with our acquisition of NewSouth, the direct-to-consumer channel. We believe this broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the repair and remodel, and residential and commercial new construction end markets.

Our Estate Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, outside noise, and offer UV protection. Estate’s aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors’ frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes.
 Western Window Systems
 WWS’s products are non-impact products, and include both customized products for its custom sales channel, and standard products for its volume, production builder, sales channel, and carry the Western Windows Systems® brand under four product categories of the Classic Line, Performance Line, Minimalist Multi-Slide Door, and the Simulated Steel Line.
 Classic Line. WWS’s Classic Line is a portfolio of high-quality, disappearing glass walls and windows that combine exceptional performance with clean design.

Sales of the Classic Line products are focused on the volume/production builder market in relatively temperate areas in the Southwestern United States.
 Performance Line. The Performance Line by WWS is a family of moving glass walls and windows engineered to satisfy its customers’ energy and structural requirements, while promoting a contemporary, modern architectural design. The Performance Line has broad thermal capabilities that allow this luxury line of products to satisfy all energy codes throughout the United States.
 Simulated Steel Line. The Simulated Steel Line by WWS is a portfolio of thermally-broken, aluminum moving glass walls and windows that look like steel but are far more affordable. This portfolio of products embodies WWS’s nearly 60 years of advancements in door and window design, and we believe exhibits luxury and refinement. The Simulated Steel Line has clean, narrow profiles which gives the glass components of the products a prominent positioning, while maximizing natural light.
 Minimalist Multi-Slide Door. The recently launched Minimalist Multi-Slide door by WWS offers innovative narrow interlock stiles that provide a minimalist aesthetic with maximum daylight. This combination of large panel sizes, discreet lines, and energy efficient low-E, dual-pane glass delivers a beautiful new way to minimize the boundaries between indoors and outdoors.

 Eco Window Systems and CGI Commercial
 Eco manufactures impact resistant windows and doors which are engineered to meet the toughest standards in the industry at the best price while ensuring the durability, elegance, and safety of all products for both the commercial and residential markets.
 Windows and Doors. Eco manufactures a wide array of aluminum single-hung, horizontal rolling, fixed, and casement windows which are all impact resistant. Eco also manufactures several varieties of aluminum, impact-resistant patio and entry doors such as French, sliding, garage, bi-fold, and pivot which we believe complement the existing product lines offered by PGT Custom Windows & Doors and CGI Windows and Doors.
 Glass production. Eco produces its own processed glass products, which supplies all of its window and door manufacturing operations’ requirements for glass. Eco’s glass production capacity also allows incremental vertical integration of glass for the production of certain of our other product lines, enabling us to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass. Eco also sells a small amount of glass other to third-party customers.
 Commercial Storefront System. Our Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system is designed with the goal of providing easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges.

 Anlin windows and patio doors are tested and certified by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), the American Architectural Manufactures Association (AAMA), and Energy Star. Each certification assures homeowners that our windows and patio doors are manufactured to the highest quality and energy standards.
Martin Door
 Martin is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah with an operating history exceeding 85 years and is a leading custom manufacturer of premium overhead garage doors and hardware, serving the Western United States. Martin is recognized in the industry for high-quality and fully-customizable products to both commercial and residential end markets.
Sales and Marketing
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on strengthening partnerships with our loyal distributors and dealers in the repair and remodel, and new construction markets by consistently providing exceptional customer service, industry-leading product designs and quality, valuable insight on building code requirements and industry trends, and technical expertise. We also market our products directly to national and regional homebuilders, who then purchase our products from our long-standing network of dealers and distributors. With our acquisition of NewSouth Window Solutions in February 2020, our sales strategy expanded to include a focus on direct-to-consumer sales to meet the growing demand from consumers looking for a manufacturer-to-home selling experience. Our 2021 acquisition of a controlling ownership stake in ECO has provided us with more product offerings and customer relationships in the commercial market, which we believe will be a high growth market in future periods. Most recently, our acquisition of Martin in October 2022, has expanded our product portfolio into a new market of commercial and residential garage doors.
 Our marketing strategy is designed to promote the quality and benefits of our products and targets both coastal and inland markets across the U.S. We reach our customers through traditional and web-based advertising; consumer promotions; and showrooms and selling materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers, and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market products from our house of brands to consumers based on performance and life-style benefits they value, as well as through the purchase channels they desire.
 Our Customers
We have a highly diversified base of nearly 4,000 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors and garage door installation dealers. This number includes the distributor networks of Martin, acquired during 2022. We believe there is minimal overlap with our existing dealer network from the acquisition of Martin.
 -  -


In 2022, our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of net sales and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 19% of net sales. This compares to 4% and 20%, respectively, in 2021. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodel end markets, which represented approximately 42% and 58% of our sales, respectively, during 2022. This compares to 42% and 58%, respectively, in 2021. These percentages were consistent year-over-year.
 We generally do not supply our products directly to homebuilders, but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders for both our impact resistant products, and also for our products sold in the west. With the acquisition of NewSouth, we sell direct to the end customer.
 Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships
Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. With the acquisition of Martin, steel is an additional primary material used in our manufacturing operations of garage doors. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements can be terminated by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our material suppliers.
 Glass, which includes sheet glass and finished glass, which we sourced from three major national suppliers in 2022, represented approximately 36% of our material purchases during 2022, compared with 40% in 2021. Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 39% of our material purchases during 2022, compared with 36% in 2021. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, typically accounts for approximately 5% of our material purchases. The remainder of our material purchases in 2022 and 2021 were primarily composed of hardware and other materials used in the manufacturing process.
 Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply.
 As discussed below in the section titled "Backlog”, at the end of 2022, as compared to the end of 2021, our backlog of sales orders has decreased. We define backlog as orders that we have received and have accepted from customers, but that have not yet shipped. The majority of this decrease is a result of an increase in production capacity in 2022, but also includes an increase relating to the acquisition of Martin in 2022. During 2021, our backlog increased as a result of growth in orders above our capacity to keep pace with the increased demand. As a result, during 2021, we opened an additional approximately 130,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Fort Myers, Florida to provide additional manufacturing capacity. We continue to have good relations with our glass supply chain partners, and we have gained additional control over our supply chain for glass with our acquisition of a 75% stake in Eco, whose vertically integrated operations includes a glass manufacturing division which supplies all of the impact-resistant glass used in Eco’s window and door products, as well as providing an additional source for CGI. We believe that our investment in Eco has provided us with a secure, high-quality, dependable supply of glass for our operations. Prior to our acquisition of Eco, it was historically a significant source of our glass needs and continues to be such today.
 Backlog
Our backlog was $228.8 million as of December 31, 2022, and $355.9 million as of January 1, 2022. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped. The majority of this decrease in backlog resulted from an increase in the Company’s overall production capacity, with corresponding lower lead times, as the level of order entries during 2022, compared to 2021 remained relatively flat. For additional discussion of factors affecting our backlog of orders, see the section titled "Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships" above.
 We expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2023, due in part to our lead times, which typically range from four to ten weeks for a majority of our products.
 Intellectual Property
We own and have registered trademarks in the U.S. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trade names when necessary, the trade-name protection provided by them is perpetual.

Manufacturing
Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida, Arizona, California, and Utah. In Florida, we produce customized impact-resistant and non-impact products. In Arizona, we produce a combination of aluminum and vinyl, customized non-impact products for the custom channel of our WWS brand, and standard products for its volume channel. In California, we produce vinyl custom non-impact products which, combined with our products manufactured in Arizona, we believe gives us a complete array of aluminum and vinyl, custom and standard window and door products for what we believe is a high-growth western market. In Utah, we produce premium overhead garage doors and hardware, serving the Western United States.
 The manufacturing process for our PGT Custom Windows & Doors products typically begins in our glass plant in North Venice, Florida, where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers, and then windows and doors are manufactured in our plants in North Venice, Florida, and our newly opened manufacturing facility in Fort Myers, Florida. Our Hialeah (CGI), and Tampa (NewSouth), Florida facilities and our Phoenix, Arizona (WWS) and Clovis, California (Anlin) facilities primarily source their glass needs from external suppliers. As discussed in the section titled “Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships” above, our acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Eco, which has been one of our glass suppliers before the acquisition, provides us with a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for a portion of our operations in Florida.
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers’ specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet or with contracted carriers within 48 hours of completion.
 With the Martin Acquisition, we added premium overhead garage doors to our product portfolio. Doors are designed and uniquely built to customer specifications using a variety of materials including aluminum extrusion, steel coil, and glass. Fabrication of materials usually starts within 24 hours of a customer order being received, and production usually takes two to three days to complete. Once complete, the door is staged for will-call pick-up or delivery via a third-party contracted delivery method.
 Competition
The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geography. The competition falls into the following categories.
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products.
National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations.
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of residential and commercial windows and doors.
Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufacturers that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact-resistant windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards.
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our position as one of the leaders in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the innovative designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers.
 Environmental Considerations
Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations.

Human Capital Management
Employees. As of the end of 2022, we employed approximately 5,500 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
 Employee Safety. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we have taken significant steps in recent years to drive improvements in this area. Some of these safety initiatives we have taken, include:
 ● Increasing the size, experience and other qualifications of our environment, health and safety, or “E&HS”, staff;
 ● Adopting an incident management system that records workplace injuries based on type and other classifications to provide the data to drive targeted corrective and preventative actions to address and mitigate actual and potential causes of injuries;
 ● Implementing proactive safety practices such as regular floor leader-led safety inspections of their work areas;
 ● Implementing ergonomics-related safety improvements, using an experience and risk-based approach to prioritize those improvements;
 ● Partnering with vendors to obtain high quality personal protective equipment and related training on how to appropriately utilize that equipment;
 ● Increasing workplace and compliance related safety training through the use of both virtual and classroom courses as well as on-the-floor safety discussions;
 ● Training team members to identify, report and quickly address potentially unsafe activities and practices;
 ● Utilizing train the trainer programs to develop internal team members as trainers for safety compliance items such as Forklift operation and LOTO Authorized; and
 ● Increasing the frequency, number and types of internal workplace safety audits, inspections and walk-throughs conducted by the Company’s EH&S staff.
 ● In response to the impact that Hurricane Ian had on our community and employees during September of 2022, we took a number of actions to respond to those who were impacted by the storm, including:
 - Rescuing stranded team members and their families from flooded areas via kayaks, paddleboards and boats;
 - Hosting distribution events at the Company’s plant locations in Venice and Fort Myers on Friday, September 30, to provide essential relief supplies for team members. Items distributed included generators, chainsaws, water, batteries, tarps, first aid kits, and more;
 - Delivering essential relief supplies to team members not able to travel to the distribution sites;
 - Dispatching task force groups to assist with home repair and delivery of supplies;
 - Offering extra Volunteer Paid Time Off to team members who can help with recovery efforts;
 - Offering Family Fund loans for its team members who have significant damage to their homes or property;
 Labor Practices and Human Rights. All of our employees earn more than the federal minimum wage and we believe our hourly wages are competitive with the local communities in which our facilities operate. The average hourly wage, excluding incentive compensation, of a full-time hourly employee of the Company was approximately $19.12 as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $17.74 as of January 1, 2022, with approximately one-half of those hourly employees earning an average hourly wage of $18.00 or more. The average total compensation, including incentive compensation and benefits, for a full-time hourly employee of our Company in 2022 was approximately $52,000.
 We strive to help our employees maintain job stability, so they are encouraged to stay with the Company and positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. The 2022 annualized voluntary turnover rate in our workforce decreased slightly as
-  -


compared to 2021. In an effort to reduce employee turnover, we engage in annual surveys with employees, we maintain an open-door policy that enables us to help identify any issues before they cause an employee to leave the Company, and we review exit interview data, hotline calls and root cause analysis to help deter turnover. We also assign dedicated Company human resources representatives to each department so that we can better monitor employee morale within each department.
Workforce Diversity and Inclusion. We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our employees and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities in which we operate and sell our products. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base and reflects the communities we serve. Our aim is to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also recruiting, developing, mentoring, training, and retaining a diverse workforce, including a diverse group of management-level employees.
 ● PGT Innovations Leading Ladies, a program designed to identify, develop and mentor female employees who have demonstrated potential for serving as leaders within our organization;
 ● Annual Diversity & Inclusion Training; and
● Dale Carnegie, a program that helps our managers understand how to appreciate, respect and value individual differences and behaviors.
 Additionally, we have a gender- and ethnically-diverse Board of Directors.
 Benefits and Well-Being. We believe in offering career opportunities, resources, programs, and tools to help employees grow and develop, as well as competitive wages and benefits to retain them. Our efforts in these areas include:
 ● Offering platforms, including on-line and in-person professional growth and development training, to help employees develop their skills and grow their careers at the Company;
 ● Providing management development training to all of our management-level employees, including compliance, ethics and leadership training;
 ● Providing employees with recurring training on critical issues such as safety and security, compliance, ethics and integrity and information security;
 ● Gathering engagement feedback from our employees on a regular basis and responding to that feedback in a variety of ways including personal, one-on-one interactions, team meetings, leadership communications, and town hall meetings with employees, led by senior executives;
 ● Offering a tuition reimbursement program that provides eligible employees up to $50,000 lifetime for courses related to current or future roles at the Company;
 ● Offering health benefits for all eligible employees, including our eligible hourly employees;
 ● Providing confidential counseling for employees through our Employee Assistance Program;
 ● Providing paid time off to eligible employees;
 ● Matching employees’ 401(k) plan contributions of up to 3% of eligible pay after 3 months of service;
 ● Offering an employee stock purchase program for eligible employees; and
 ● Providing a Company-subsidized childcare center for the employees of our Venice, Florida facility, which is our largest location.
