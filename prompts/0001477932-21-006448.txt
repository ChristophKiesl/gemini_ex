ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Throughout this document we use the following terms: Aqualyte™, ConsERV™, NanoClear™, PolyCool™ and NanoAir™ , all of which are unregistered trademarks of the Company.
 
Overview
 
Dais Corporation (“Dais”, “us,” “we,”, the “Company”) is a nano-structured polymer technology materials company having developed and now commercializing products using the features and properties found in its platform of nanomaterial branded and sold as Aqualyte™ . The first commercial product is the Aqualyte nanomaterial itself, used by OEMs to create differentiated products, while the second product is a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator called ConsERV, which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. We continue to develop other nano-structured polymer technology applications in HVAC/Refrigeration, energy, food services and wastewater treatment industries.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993 as Dais Corporation. The Company was formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials.
 
In December 1999, the Company purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, a corporation founded in 1984 to provide design, analysis, and systems integration services in the field of fuel cells, fuel processors, and integrated fuel cell power systems. Subsequently, on December 13, 1999, the Company changed its name to Dais Analytic Corporation.
 
In March 2002, the Company sold substantially all its fuel cell assets to Chevron, a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of the Company’s obligations. Subsequently, the Company focused on expanding its nano-structured polymer platform, having already identified the Energy Recovery Ventilator (“ERV”) application as our first commercial product.
 
In November of 2018, the board of directors unanimously voted to change the name of the Company from Dais Analytic Corporation to Dais Corporation (the “Name Change”). The Name Change took effect with FINRA on February 27, 2019.
 
On November 2, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in the authorized common shares of the company from 240,000,000 shares to 340,000,000 shares. On March 14, 2019, the shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares from 340,000,000 shares to 1,100,000,000 shares. In July 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at the ratio ranging from one-for-500 to one-for-2,000. On October 31, 2019, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect a one-for-2,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse split was effective December 6, 2019. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in this annual report and the accompanying financial statements and footnotes to reflect the effects of the reverse split.
 
Our Technology
 
We use proprietary nanotechnology to reformulate thermoplastic materials called polymers. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. Polymers are chemical, plastic-like compounds used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. A thermoplastic is a material that is plastic or deformable, melts to a liquid when heated and to a brittle, glassy state when cooled sufficiently. These reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways. We transform polymers from a hard, water impermeable substance into a material which water and similar liquids can, under certain conditions, diffuse (although there are no openings in the material) as molecules as opposed to liquid water. Water and similar liquids penetrate the thermoplastic material at the molecular level without oxygen and other atmospheric gases penetrating the material. It is believed this selectivity is dependent on the size and type of a molecule. We call this specialized material in its multiple forms the Aqualyte™ Platform of Nanomaterial.

The Company believes its Aqualyte™ platform of Nanomaterial acts as a disruptive catalyst enabling products with differentiated features addressing what we believe to be an international market spanning a number of industries. We believe a differentiated product is characterized, by some or all of the attributes below:
 :
 
· | Longer operational lifetimes 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Consume less energy 
· | Release less CO2 into the atmosphere 
· | Provide strong pathogen protection (COVID) and lower allergy/asthma triggers 
· | Mental acuity improves by over 100% shown by 3rd ConsERV in blind study testing 
· | Extends useable life of fresh foods and other organic materials 
· | Clean most forms of contaminated wastewater to levels up to one-hundred times greater than noted in the Clean Water Act of 1970.

Our Products
 
The Company’ uses its knowledge of the Aqualyte nanomaterial to integrate it into traditional or new product form factors. It is management’s belief based on 3rd party industry or independent test results, the Company’s own testing, or data from customer use that the resulting product’s features and benefits address the growing market needs resulting from, but not limited to, the drivers of climate change as well as those needs created by the pandemic. 
Nanomaterial Platform - Aqualyte™ 
 
The Aqualyte Nanomaterial is made from commercially available polymer resin and industrial grade solvents which are mixed using a proprietary process with traditional industrial equipment, and solvents. The resin and the solvents are commercially available from a number of chemical supply houses or firms such as Dow. Our process changes the molecular properties of the starting polymer resins such that in their final Aqualyte form they offer very different properties.
 
Aqualyte is a disruptive platform plastic material technology with carefully tailored properties for use in air, energy, and water applications. This modified block copolymer membrane with a nanoscale structure serves as the foundation of the Dais product line. The material forms a nonporous plastic membrane able to move moisture through itself while blocking passage of most gases and volatile compounds. The membrane is robust and has no pores to clog or to accumulate bacterial or fungal growth over time. Multiple independent third parties have validated the performance of Aqualyte and the protection it provides from the harmful effects of viral and bacterial pathogens, differentiating products using the Aqualyte Nanomaterial Platform from their competition. 
 
The Company continues to develop next generation versions of its Aqualyte nanomaterial working to increase existing feature performance, add new features, and improving its cost. The Company sells Aqualyte to skilled OEMs using it’s features and properties to create their own improved or new products in a range of applications. In 2017, Dais signed a multi-year agreement with The Haier Group (the “Haier Supply Agreement” described below) that led to increased sales of Aqualyte to Haier for use in their products. 
 
ConsERV™
 
We continue to expand sales channels to drive growth of revenues of the ConsERV product. ConsERV is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save up to 30% on HVAC operating costs, lower CO2 emissions and allow HVAC equipment to be up to 30% smaller, reducing peak energy usage by up to 20% while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently and results, in many cases, in energy and cost savings. ConsERV generally attaches onto existing HVAC systems, typically in commercial buildings, to provide improved ventilation air within the structure. ConsERV pre-conditions the incoming air by passing over our nanotechnology polymer which has been formed into a full enthalpy heat exchanger (the “core”). The nanotechnology heat exchanger uses the stale building air that must be simultaneously exhausted to transfer heat and moisture into or out of the incoming air. For summer air conditioning, the core removes some of the heat and humidity from the incoming air, transferring it to the exhaust air stream thereby, under certain conditions, saving energy. For winter heating, the core transfers a portion of the heat and humidity into the incoming air from the exhaust air stream thereby often saving energy. When compared to similar competitive products, we believe, based on test results conducted by the Air-conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERV maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat. 
 
Historically, overall ConsERV sales were negatively impacted by the establishment of a license for the company’s ConsERV system’s business license(s). Since termination of the license, the company has worked to reestablish supply and sales channels shuttered in 2012 at the beginning of the license. The Company is working intensively to introduce by the end of 2021 the most effective ConsERV system to date driven by the design and introduction of a new line of ERV systems powered by newer energy recovery cores. 
 
The sales channels for ConsERV continue to expand across N. America and include private labeling efforts. The Company continues to build up the ConsERV sales (cores and systems) channels in the North American market. The Company has and continues to negotiate exclusive arrangements with representatives in multiple regions across North America who in turn target architect and specifying engineers, select OEMs, utility sponsored programs, and sophisticated users of HVAC equipment. 
 
ConsERV revenues having begun to grow in 2019 stagnated in 2020 mainly because of the pandemic’s effects. We believe the growth initiatives will allow the company to effectively addresses up to 75% of the ERV market in N. America. 
 
We continue to have targeted discussions with several companies in the European Union interested in buying and distributing both Aqualyte nanomaterial for use in their ERV cores as well as selling Dais produced ConsERV cores. To help us expand our capabilities in the reported high growth HVAC markets in Southeast Asia, Dais qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERV cores using Aqualyte membrane to meet the growing demand for ConsERV systems in the Region. 
 
The Company expects this trend of growing ConsERV system, core, and Aqualyte nanomaterial revenues to continue into 2021 and beyond. We believe the market for pandemic safety, and the growing focus on Climate Change reducing products.

Possible Future Products Under Development Currently:
 
NanoClear ™
 
NanoClear is a product in development and is believed to offer strategic advantages over existing industrial wastewater cleaning processes. We constructed and operated a pilot plant installed at a local county wastewater treatment facility that was commissioned in May 2013 and updated to the current generation of membrane evaporator in November 2016. This site has served as a showcase for potential commercial customers as well as a test bed for newer materials and hardware readying for commercialization. The accumulated test data, analyzed by an independent 3rd party firm, shows the quality of the water being produced has not diminished since system start-up.
 
We soft-introduced a limited number of NanoClear Membrane Evaporators (ME) for pilot testing in China; the ME removes quantities of metals, acids, salt and other impurities from various contaminated water sources, producing potable water using an environmentally friendly, low maintenance design that is competitive with industry leaders in terms of electrical consumption. The evolving NanoClear product line purifies contaminated water, created largely during cooling of key manufacturing and utility processes. 
 
The product’s core strength, supported by Company, customer, and third party generated information, is its ability to clean up contaminated wastewater created by a variety of manufacturing processes.
 
Development efforts continue under a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $1,000,000, Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award ending in the third quarter of 2021, to develop NanoClear water cleaning technology for military use. The NanoClear funding project titled “Non-Fouling Water Reuse Technologies” uses our patented Aqualyte membrane to produce potable water from grey-water sources. The potential product improvements from this award will widen NanoClear’s market uses in separating clean water from contaminated waste streams.
 
PolyCool ™
 
PolyCool is a product in development and is believed to offer strategic advantages over existing cooling tower systems. Initial testing shows it reduces the likelihood of dangerous germs and viruses such as Legionella becoming airborne. 
 
PolyCool systems are expected to use less energy than a conventional cooling tower while reducing the need for chemical biocide application. We believe these savings can significantly reduce the operating expenses of a cooling tower versus conventional technology. This advantage expands the applicability of evaporative cooling into geographic regions that are suffering from water scarcity or stress. In addition, the dramatic reduction in maintenance and safety issues allows use of PolyCool™ in smaller installations with correspondingly smaller maintenance budgets and less risk tolerance, which conventionally use less energy efficient dry cooling instead of evaporative cooling.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
In the quarter ending September 30, 2018, Dais entered into a strategic development and licensing agreement with the Haier Group, located in Qingdao, China. This innovative work is based around the Company’s Aqualyte nanomaterial potentially enhancing the performance of several Haier products. The efforts are set to run through the end of 2022 and have been heavily affected by the Pandemic. If Haier was integrate the technology into their product(s) and associated sales channels management feels such a move could have a significant revenue impact for Dais. We believe the potential revenue impact can be better assessed during the 1st quarter of 2023. 
 
In July 2017, we signed a seven year, non-exclusive agreement with the Menred Group (http://www.menred.eu/en/index.html), China, to provide our Aqualyte moisture transfer nanomaterial for use in key Menred products being sold into sales channels for the Chinese construction related markets.

Our Patents
 
Dais has owned 24 granted patents over its corporate history, some of which have reached the end of their enforceable term. As of December 31, 2020, we own the active, enforceable rights to eleven U.S. patents, four Chinese patents, two Hong Kong patents, and three Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications that are still being examined. A national stage application based on one of these PCT applications resulted in notification that one U.S. patent would be granted in the first quarter of 2021. These patents relate to, or are applications of, our nano-structured polymer materials that perform functions such as ion exchange and modification of surface properties. The polymers are selectively permeable to polar materials, such as water, in molecular form. Selective permeability allows these materials to function as a nano-filter in various transfer applications. These materials are made from base polymer resins available from several commercial firms worldwide and possess what we believe to be some unique and controllable properties, such as:

• | Selectivity: Based on our research, we believe that when the polymer is made there are small channels created that are 5 to 30 nanometers in diameter. There are two types of these channels: hydrophilic (water permeable), and hydrophobic (water impermeable). The channels can be chemically tuned to be selective for the ions or molecules they transfer. The selectivity of the polymer can be adjusted to efficiently transfer water molecules from one face to the other using these channels. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | High transfer rate: Based on in-house testing protocols and related results, we have found that the channels created when casting the materials into a nano-structured membrane have a transfer rate of water, or flux, greater than 90% of an equivalent area of an open tube. This feature is fundamental to the material’s ability to transfer moisture at the molecular level while substantially allowing or disallowing the transfer of certain other substances at a molecular level. 
• | Unique surface characteristic: During the formation of our nanomaterial, we believe the resulting inherent features of this material allow it to offer highly efficient latent and sensible transfer abilities as well as creating an inhospitable surface area to support the growth of most known pathogens, mold, and mildew. This belief is validated by testing done by 3rd party industry organizations over the past decade. The third parties (including laboratories, universities, utilities, and end users) use known industry standards, i.e., ASTM and others, for their test protocols. The test results, as well as the Company’s own on-going testing, supports the belief the features of a properly configured product tuned to manage the features of the company’s nanomaterial allow functionally diverse, higher efficiency products to be built and sold worldwide resulting in the creation of an on-going, growing, sustainable revenue streams focused squarely on shareholder value.

 
The company also owns multiple utility patents that cover inventions that are new, improvements and useful processes including the design and fabrication of devices or approaches that use properties of the polymers described above for HVAC, energy, food preservation and water treatment applications.

---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additional patent applications are being examined that are not yet publicly visible in the patent system and will be revealed at the appropriate time. Patents may or may not be granted on any of the above applications. We also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our current and prospective strategic partners and employees.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company currently assembles ConsERV cores, a mixed in/out system build with all Aqualyte fabrication outsourced. For future expansion and high-volume scale-up, the Company has continued to establish a robust supply chain with strategic partners having existing multiple channel access to markets – or with qualified outsourced firms. We use a blended “outsourced / in-house” model for material, component, and assembly needs. We do not have long term contractual relationships with any of our manufacturers or vendors. There are no subassemblies or components that could not be purchased from alternative suppliers. Purchases to date of raw materials and related services have been on a purchase order basis using non-disclosure agreements.
 
OEM Customers, and Suppliers
 
Using the properties and features of its Aqualyte Nanomaterial the Company has proven results in a variety of cross industry markets. We look to provide Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with Aqualyte membrane. Then sharing how to use the options and features found in Aqualyte, to find the OEM able to offer better or even new products in consumer, commercial, and industrial having what we believe to be belter lifetimes, and efficiencies. 
 
We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for our nano-structured based materials and of the value-added products made with these materials. 
 
We require our suppliers to provide components in a timely manner, and to meet the Company’s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications with acceptable terms. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company’s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company were ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs, but this would create delays in production.

Research and Development
 
Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of $221,700 and $293,751 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of $123,055 and $89,994 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Sales and Marketing Strategies
 
We have secured and continue to discuss relationships with leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies, and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERV products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide.
 
The Company is focused on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERV and Aqualyte OEM uses. We are using the data and experience of past sales in a variety of markets, adding newer features and functions, working to increase revenues. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the Company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs.
 
Competition and Barriers to Entry
 
We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology can decrease sales of competing products, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe that our ConsERV product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate channel decision makers of the benefits of products made using our materials and processes is to have qualified people and certified product to overcome the strength of other products in the channels with what we believe is a diminished value proposition with current product sales in all sales channel members. Armed with the growing base of operational and third-party data this education process will become routine.
 
There are several companies located in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personal resources than us. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to:
 

Products | Current and Future Competitors 
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConsERV | Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, Fuwei, Ltd, CORE Energy Recovery Solutions, Renewaire, Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange.

 
We believe that the combination of our nano-material platform’s characteristics and growing patent position forms competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. Many of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes.

Government Regulation
 
We do not believe the sale, installation or use of our current nano-structured products will be subject to any government regulation, other than perhaps adherence to building codes and water safety regulations. We do not believe that the cost of complying with such codes and regulations, to the extent applicable to our products, will be prohibitive.
 
We do not know the extent to which any existing or new regulations may affect our ability to distribute, install and service any of our products. Once our other products reach the commercialization stage and we begin distributing them to our target markets, federal, state, or local governmental entities may seek to impose regulations.
 
We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, and environmental regulations regarding handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Our business may expose us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in potential personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and natural resource damage. Depending on the nature of any claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims and, in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. To date, we are not aware of any claims or liabilities under these existing laws and regulations that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 10 full-time employees and one independent contractor. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. As of the date of filing the number of employees of the Company has not changed. 
Principal Offices
 
Our principal office is located at 11552 Prosperous Drive, Odessa, FL 33556.
