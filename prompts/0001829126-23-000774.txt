Item 1. Business
Background
 
Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation was incorporated on March 7, 2013 in the State of Nevada. On May 9, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation and changed our ticker symbol to GWHP.
Our Business
 
The Company develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) tests. The Company has developed over 125 Diagnostic Tests with the criteria that they be “low cost”, OTC or “self-administered”, “absolutely accurate”, and provide “immediate results”. Company scientists participated in the development of the original Pregnancy test which was the first diagnostic to include these criteria and these criteria have been included in all Diagnostic tests developed by the Company since. Tests with these criteria have become to be known as “Rapid Tests”. The Company has 45 FDA approved tests for distribution in the US which include tests for Troponin, Colorectal, and Drug testing among others. The remainder tests  carry an FDA Certificate of Exportability for distribution in foreign countries and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue Fever, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Yellow Fever, Corona Viruses, and other epidemic and vector borne diseases.
 
The Company currently markets a range of IVD test kits for consumer use through over-the-counter (“OTC” or consumer), or consumer-use and point-of-care (“POC” or professional) for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad.
 
All of the products we sell are manufactured in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Approved Facility in the USA. An FDA Approved facility is a facility that meets Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) with the FDA.
 
We sell products internationally which are not FDA approved to sell in the US. These products include an FDA Certificate of Exportability and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Corona Viruses, and other vector borne diseases.
 
CoVid-19 Activities
 
From January of 2020 through January 2022, the Company was largely unsuccessful in it’s efforts to develop and sell COVID tests due to the commoditization of such tests and to the lack of recognition of the Company in the marketplace. The Company believes the opportunity here has diminished and is now focusing on its core business of manufacturing and distributing its vast product line of Diagnostic Tests.

Plan of Operation
 
The Company is currently focusing its attention on marketing its core FDA OTC approved products which includes tests for pregnancy, ovulation, colorectal, drugs of abuse, glucose strips and glucose monitors through various platforms, including Walmart, Amazon, eBay and a recent contract with PrimeCare America for distribution in the Midwestern part of the country.
Industry
 
The IVD testing industry encompasses the following two primary categories: the OTC market and the POC. The concepts that distinguish POC technology—operation simple enough for non-laboratory users; little or no maintenance requirement; and rapid, reliable results—mean that it can be applied equally well in many non-clinical settings, such as the OTC market. As advances in medical technology increasingly make it possible to diagnose diseases and physiological conditions from ever-smaller amounts of body fluids, certain diseases and conditions that once required diagnosis by physicians and/or medical technicians inside hospital emergency rooms, exam rooms/bedside studies, or private clinics, can now also be done by inexpensive, easy-to-use diagnostic devices that consumers can use in the comfort and anonymity of their home. Today, the average pharmacy, whether a privately owned neighborhood store, or chain owned, has become an outlet for selling IVD test kits for in-home use.
 
The Company believes, according to publicly available sources, that the IVD industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that is increasing each year. This assessment includes all laboratory hospital-based products, over-the-counter devices, and rapid tests performed at the point-of-care. The Company believes that the following factors can be attributed to the increase in overall need and use of IVD test kits: an aging baby-boomer population; increasing healthcare costs; the ever-growing number of uninsured and under-insured in the U.S. and abroad; and a general increase in consumer awareness, in part due to the wealth of information available on the Internet.
 
Competition
 
Diagnostic products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. We compete with several companies around the world who possess significantly greater technical and financial resources and professional and consumer reach and recognition, including Accon Labs, Johnson & Johnson, DB, Abbott, and Roche all of whom carry similar products.
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company is focused on generating increased sales through online retail, large and small distributors and directly to doctors, hospitals, clinics and governments. The Company is taking steps and developing the materials needed to effect its marketing strategy.
Research and Development
 
We are continuing to look for needs in the world to create and work with our scientific team and science partners to make IVD tests for a variety of diseases as the need and opportunity arises.
Facilities
 
The Company manufactures at two FDA approved labs located in San Diego and Escondido, California. All products are manufactured in the United States. The Corporate headquarters is located separately in the San Clemente, California business district. The two facilities have capacity to produce 250,000 units per day on a single shift. Further, additional facilities for lease are plentiful and can be equipped and setup quickly. We also provide third party manufacturing services.
 
The Company has sufficient warehouse facilities to accommodate our maximum production volumes and to keep sufficient inventory requirements (three months inventory of client order size) for subsequent refill orders by customers.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has two employees, including Mr. Rene Alvarez, Chairman, President, CEO, Treasurer and Secretary and Edgar Gonzales, Director and Vice President. 
 
Mr. Charles Strongo resigned from all Officer positions as well as a member of the Board. All of his functions were delegated to Mr. Rene Alvarez. Also, the Board accepted resignations from Dr. Ciu, Dr. Ford. Dr. Paez de la Cerda, and Wolfgang Groeters; all were appointed by Mr. Strongo. Mr Alvarez is re-constituting the Board at this time and has accepted Mr. Edgar B. Gonzalez to Board membership. It is anticipated that three additional members will be accepted soon. At the present time, we have no full-time employees. Messrs. Alvarez and Gonzalez devote approximately 40 to 60 hours each per week or as much time as is necessary to conduct the affairs of the company. The company utilizes independent contractors when necessary.
