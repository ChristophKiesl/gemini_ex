Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

 
Nxt-ID is an emerging technology company engaged in the development of proprietary products, solutions and solutions that serve multiple end markets, including Security, Healthcare, Finance and Internet of Things (IoT). Our innovative MobileBio® security technologies that serve these end markets include encryption and payments, biometrics, security and privacy, sensors and miniaturization technologies. Our core competencies and intellectual property in biometrics, security, sensors, and miniaturization – developed through intensive research and development over the past decade –enable us to target and serve multiple large and growing end markets globally.
 

We believe that our MobileBio® products will provide distinct advantages within the m-commerce market by improving mobile security. Currently most mobile devices are protected simply by PIN numbers which are easily duplicated on another device, and can easily be spoofed or hacked. Our security paradigm is Dynamic Pairing Codes (“DPC”). DPC is a new, proprietary method to secure users, devices, accounts, locations and servers over any communication media by sharing key identifiers, including biometric-enabled identifiers, between end-points by passing dynamic pairing codes (random numbers) between end-points to establish sessions and/or transactions without exposing identifiers or keys. The ongoing high-level breaches of personal credit card data demand new securities to offer higher levels of consumer protection through the use of biometrics and other proprietary solutions. Our strategic plan envisions using our core biometric facial and voice recognition algorithms to develop security applications (both cloud based and locally hosted) that can be used for companies (for industrial uses, such as enterprise computer networks) as well as individuals (for consumer uses, such as smartphones, tablets or personal computers), law enforcement, the defense industry, and the U.S. Department of Defense. NXT-ID has numerous patents pending. Many of these patents pending focus on tokenization and protection, as well as payment methodology, voice biometrics, and other biometric forms of directed payment.
 
In healthcare, our business initiatives were bolstered by the acquisition of LogicMark, which we completed in the third quarter of 2016. LogicMark serves a market that enables two-way communication, sensors, biometrics and security to make home care for chronic medical conditions, including “aging in place,” a reality. There are three major trends driving this market: 1) an aging population, 2) a desire to “age in place” and 3) the acute need to lower cost of care. These trends together have produced a large and growing market for us to serve. LogicMark has built a business around emergency communications in healthcare. We have a strong business with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today serving veterans who suffer from chronic conditions that often require emergency assistance. This business is steady and growing. Our strategic plan calls for expanding LogicMark’s business into other retail and enterprise channels to better serve the expanding demand for secure and remote healthcare.

Remote healthcare, which includes health monitoring and management using IoT and cloud-based processing, is an emerging area for LogicMark. The long-term trend toward more home-based care is a massive shift that is being driven by demographics (an aging population) and basic economics. People also value autonomy and privacy which are important factors in determining which solutions will suit the market. Consumers are beginning to enjoy the benefits of smart home technologies and online digital assistants. One of the promising applications of our VoiceMatch™ technology is enabling secure commands for restricted medical access. This solution, when coupled with the NXT-ID BioCloud™, combines biometrics with encryption and distributed access control.
 

Security and privacy concerns are already central to the adoption of IoT solutions that provides a large opportunity for the Company to collaborate and license their technology to the consumer-facing firms that aim to address the IoT opportunity.
 
In the finance area, the technology pioneered in the Nxt-ID “Wocket” has continued to develop in both range of capability while shrinking in size. This provides a technology package that can be integrated into a “smart wallet” that has the same technology as Apple Pay or into a card that can be used for a variety of transactions including – magnetic stripe emulation (Wi-Mag), Near Field Communication (NFC), tokens, barcode/QR codes and there can also be an EMV chip and a Bluetooth Beacon for remote sensing and response applications. Versions of this technology package provide a functional and secure “vault” that allows for full consumer control and customization by OEMs and solution providers. 
 
Our finance business is being driven by the development of an innovative smartcard that leverages “Wocket” technology. The smartcard is called “Flye” and it is being developed in partnership with World Ventures Holdings, LLC. (WVH). The Flye card offers new and unique features compared to any other “smartcards” in the market. It handles the core functions like loading in multiple cards, gathering loyalty points while opening up new opportunities Flye is targeted at WorldVentures members who care about travel, food and entertainment. These concerns demand more than payments and include loyalty programs and security features for peace of mind when traveling. The Flye card is designed to work in synchrony with the WorldVentures smartphone application. It is a “tethered” solution, albeit a wireless one. WorldVentures has a comprehensive vision for their card that includes the ability to delivery highly tailored membership experience.
 
With respect to IoT, Nxt-ID has joined the Cisco Solution Partner program to provide biometric and encryption solutions in conjunction with other ecosystem partners. Cisco sees security as integral to IoT. They are integrating security directly into network infrastructure to enable companies to use their IoT networks in a secure fashion.
 
Our plan also anticipates that we will use our core biometric facial and voice recognition algorithms to develop security applications (both cloud based and locally hosted) that can be used for companies (for industrial uses, such as enterprise computer networks) as well as individuals (for consumer uses, such as smart phones, tablets or personal computers), law enforcement, the defense industry, and the U.S. Department of Defense. 
 
We operate our business in one segment, Hardware and Software Security Systems and Applications. We evaluate the performance of our business on, among other things, profit and loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes and amortization related to certain intangible assets.

Internet of Things
 
Closely related to electronic payments is the ability to communicate via many linked devices in a secure fashion. In cooperation with Nordic Semiconductor, ASA, the Company demonstrated a miniature module within a wearable smart band to enable devices powering the IoT (Internet of Things). The “IoT Stamp” is an intelligently connected electronics module that is small enough and low power enough to fit within most devices, even a smart card or a watch band. Key functionality includes patent pending ultra-low power “buttonless” wake-up, motion activation, and personalized services including identification services, multi-factor biometric authentication, and payment technologies including NFC and Wi-Mag.
Healthcare
 
Personal Emergency Response Systems
 
LogicMark is the leading provider of non-monitored Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) and is the industry leader in two-way voice communications. Product offerings include:
 

● | Non-monitored products that only require a one-time purchase fee, without a recurring monthly contract. As a result, they are typically the most cost-effective PERS option for the end-user 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Both traditional (i.e., landline) and mPERS (i.e., cell-based) options 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-monitored products that are sold through VA channel, healthcare distributors and dealers, and retail 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The non-monitored product is critical to the VA channel as VA will cover cost of the PERS device, but will not cover the cost of a monthly subscription for monitoring services 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security
 
MobileBio VoiceMatch® 
 
Voicematch® is a new method of recognizing both speakers and specific words providing innovative multi-factor recognition. Voice authentication is a more natural biometric method of authentication than fingerprint that allows an individual access to multiple devices. Voicematch is efficient enough to run on low-power devices and runs on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS, as well as laptops and desktops. The product helps to address the growing BYOD (Bring your own device) problem for companies by positively identifying the individual using the mobile device. Voicematch® is a potential original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) product for smartphone manufacturers. The product can also be sold as a standard development kit (“SDK”) to provide companies the opportunity to add a further layer of biometric protection to their websites and smartphone applications for their customers.
 
We currently expect commercial versions of this product to be available in the third quarter of 2017.
 
FaceMatch®
 
3D FaceMatch® and 3D SketchArtist™ are facial recognition products which are available for sale. These products are primarily designed for access control, law enforcement and travel and immigration. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, 3D-ID, we are a sub-contractor to Battelle Memorial Institute on the U.S. Department of Defense Technical Information Engineering Services (“TIES”) contract with a contract ceiling of $995 million. This is an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) contract and requires approved contractors to bid on task orders. We have not bid on any task orders to date.

Our Industries
 
Payments
 
The October 2016 issue of the Nilson Report shows that on a worldwide basis, credit, debit and prepaid cards generated $31.31 trillion in purchases of goods, services and cash advances in 2015. Losses for fraud in the same period were $21.84 billion, up 20% over 2014. This translates to losses of 6.97 cents per $100. Fraud losses have increased every year since 2010. More than 70% of all breaches in 2015 occurred in the US. There continues to be a great need for secure payment solutions. Rather than try to predict the winning technology in this fast paced evolving payment technology industry, our business plan is to develop secure solutions that can make payments using any form of payment technology from traditional magnetic stripe to NFC, Bluetooth, EMV and barcodes.
 
We believe that our Wi-Mag™ technology, possibly in combination with our voice and facial recognition biometric technologies, will provide an opportunity for smartphone manufacturers who currently do not have a payment solution on their smartphones to license that capability from us. We believe that this is a large potential opportunity for us. According to statista.com, worldwide smartphone sales to end users were approximate 1.5 billion units in 2016. Over 1 billion of these units had Android operating systems. 
 
Internet of Things (IoT)
 
Markets and Markets estimates that the Internet of Things market size will grow from $157.05 Billion in 2016 to $661.74 Billion by 2021, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.3% from 2016 to 2021.
 
BI Intelligence forecasts there will be 34 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020, up from 10 billion in 2015. IoT devices will account for 24 billion, while traditional computing devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.) will comprise 10 billion. Significantly:
 

● | Nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next five years.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Businesses will be the top adopter of IoT solutions. They see three ways the IoT can improve their bottom line by 1) lowering operating costs; 2) increasing productivity; and 3) expanding to new markets or developing new product offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Governments are focused on increasing productivity, decreasing costs, and improving their citizens’ quality of life. They are forecast to be the second-largest adopters of IoT ecosystems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumers will lag behind businesses and governments in IoT adoption. Still, they will purchase a massive number of devices and invest a significant amount of money in IoT ecosystems.

Our Competition
 
Finance
 
The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change as a result of technical developments exploited by our competitors, changing technical needs of customers, and frequent introductions of new features. We expect competition to increase as other companies introduce products that are competitively priced, that may have increased performance or functionality, or that incorporate technological advances not yet developed or implemented by us. Some of our present and potential competitors may have financial, marketing, and research resources substantially greater than ours.
 
Competitors in the digital wallet marketplace include: 
 
Google Wallet – A mobile payment system developed by Google that allows its users to store debit cards, credit cards, loyalty cards, and gift cards among other things, as well as redeeming sales promotions on their mobile phone.
 
Apple Pay – A mobile payment service that lets certain Apple mobile devices make payments at the time of retail and online checkout.
 
Paypal – A mobile service that can send money between other PayPal users and friends, track your balances, check in to pay from ones phone, and order ahead at restaurants.
 
Samsung/LoopPay – A mobile payment system that uses Magnetic Secure Transmission to broadcast a signal to a point of sale payment terminal. This company was acquired by Samsung Electronics Co. in February 2015.
 
We believe that our payment products have certain competitive advantages, particularly that our products are capable of using many different methods of payment whereas most of our competitors rely solely on NFC which has limited penetration at POS terminals worldwide.

Our Business Strategy

Our primary business strategy is to leverage our technology across various industries in combination with established partners that can establish meaningful distribution. The initial industries that we have identified are Payments, IoT, Healthcare and Security.
 
We have established a strategic partnership with WVH an international direct selling travel company, to supply them with a custom Smartcard. WVH intends to purchase the product from us for its membership, which is currently in excess of 500,000 members. We intend to pursue similar relationships with partners that have a connected customer base.
 
More and more mobile phones are being used as a source of payment for goods and services. We believe that worldwide mobile payment volume will continue to grow rapidly in the upcoming years. We are actively marketing our Wi-Mag™ technology to manufacturers of smartphones to enable them to compete with payment offerings from the two major brands: Samsung and Apple. We believe that this will result in significant licensing revenue and is a very scalable business model.
 
We have developed several proprietary methods of encryption and tokenization that we believe will help reduce fraud in credit card transactions. These technologies can be applied both at the point of sale and for online transactions. We intend to market our encryption capabilities to potential financial partners which, if successful could generate a significant source of recurring revenue per transaction to us.

With our LogicMark subsidiary we intend to expand distribution through larger distributors leveraging the consumer value proposition of a one-time device purchase as opposed to a leased monthly solution. We also intend to apply our technology to the next generation of PERS devices that will have greater functionality and vital sign monitoring capability.
 
We continue to develop opportunities for our biometric and sensor capabilities with the U.S. Department of Defense. We are partnered with established prime contractors that have or are bidding for contracts through which sales may be made. Our current partners include Battelle Memorial Institute and Verizon Federal Systems. We are a sub-contractor to Battelle Memorial Institute on the U.S. Department of Defense Technical Information Engineering Services (“TIES”) contract with a contract ceiling of $995 million. This is an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) contract and requires approved contractors to bid on task orders. We have not bid on any task orders to date.

We enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and key employees, and maintain control over access to and distribution of our technology, software and other proprietary information. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us.
 
We do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.
 
We may face claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the future. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
