GENERAL
We were founded in 1963 as an oil and natural gas contract drilling company. Today, in addition to our drilling operations, we have operations in the exploration and production and mid-stream areas. We operate, manage, and analyze our results of operations through our three principal business segments:

• | Oil and Natural Gas – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company. This segment explores, develops, acquires, and produces oil and natural gas properties for our own account.


• | Contract Drilling – carried out by our subsidiary Unit Drilling Company. This segment contracts to drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for others and for our own account.


• | Mid-Stream – carried out by our subsidiary Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries. This segment buys, sells, gathers, processes, and treats natural gas for third parties and for our own account.

Each of these companies may conduct operations through subsidiaries of their own.
The following table provides certain information about us as of February 10, 2017:

OIL AND NATURAL GAS
General. All of our oil and natural gas properties are located in the United States. Our producing oil and natural gas properties, unproved properties, and related assets are in the following locations:

Division | Location 
West division | Western and Southern Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Southern Louisiana, and Utah
East division | East Texas, Eastern Oklahoma, and Arkansas 
Central division | Western Oklahoma, Texas Panhandle, and Kansas 

When we are the operator of a property, we generally attempt to use a drilling rig owned by our contract drilling segment, and we use our mid-stream segment to gather our gas if it is economical for us to develop a system in the area.
The following table presents certain information regarding our oil and natural gas operations as of December 31, 2016:

As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant water floods, pressure maintenance operations, or any other material related activities that were in process.
Description and Location of Our Core Operations 
 West division. In our Wilcox play, located primarily in Polk, Tyler, and Hardin Counties, Texas, we completed four operated horizontal wells (average working interest 99.4%) in 2016. All four wells were completed as gas/condensate producers. Annual production from our Wilcox play averaged 94.1 MMcfe per day (12% oil, 31% NGLs, 57% natural gas) which is an increase of approximately 22% compared to 2015. We averaged approximately 0.2 Unit drilling rigs operating during 2016 and we currently plan to use approximately 0.8 Unit drilling rigs operating during 2017. We anticipate completing approximately four vertical wells and three horizontal wells during 2017. In addition, we plan to complete approximately 12 behind pipe gas and liquids zones.
Central division. In our Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend (SOHOT) play, located in western Oklahoma primarily in Grady County, we completed three horizontal oil wells (average working interest 80.2%) in the Marchand zone of the Hoxbar interval. Annual production from western Oklahoma averaged 65.1 MMcfe per day (27% oil, 22% NGLs, 51% natural gas) which is a decrease of approximately 15% compared to 2015. During 2016, we averaged approximately 0.3 Unit drilling rigs operating and we currently plan to use approximately 0.75 Unit drilling rigs operating during 2017. We anticipate completing approximately seven horizontal Marchand wells in our SOHOT play during 2017.
In our Texas Panhandle Granite Wash play, we completed one extended lateral horizontal gas/condensate well (working interest 99.4%) in our Buffalo Wallow field. Annual production from the Texas Panhandle averaged 93.7 MMcfe per day (11% oil, 37% NGLs, 52% natural gas) which is a decrease of approximately 23% compared to 2015. During 2016, we averaged approximately 0.1 Unit drilling rigs operating and we currently plan to use approximately one Unit drilling rig operating during 2017. We anticipate completing approximately seven extended lateral Granite Wash horizontal wells in our Buffalo Wallow field during 2017.
In our Mississippian play in south central Kansas, we completed one horizontal oil well (working interest 100%). Annual production from Kansas averaged 6.2 MMcfe per day (62% oil, 9% NGLs, 29% natural gas) which is a decrease of approximately 45% compared to 2015. We anticipate completing approximately two horizontal wells in our Kansas Mississippian play during 2017.

East division. Over the last several years, activity in our East division has been limited due to low gas prices since this area does not generally have oil or NGLs associated with the gas. We did not drill any wells in this division during 2016.
Dispositions. We had non-core asset sales with proceeds, net of related expenses, of $33.1 million, $1.9 million, and $67.2 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Proceeds from these dispositions reduced the net book value of the full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized. 
During the year (as well as certain prior years), we determined the value of certain of our unproved oil and gas properties were diminished (in part or in whole) based on an impairment evaluation and our anticipated future exploration plans. Those determinations resulted in $73.7 million in 2014, $114.4 million in 2015, and $7.6 million in 2016 of costs being added to the total of our capitalized costs being amortized. We incurred a $76.7 million pre-tax ($47.7 million net of tax) non-cash ceiling test write-down of our oil and natural gas properties in 2014 due to the inclusion of the impaired value of those unproved properties and a reduction of the 12-month average commodity prices during the year. In 2015, we incurred non-cash ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties of $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.0 billion net of tax) primarily due to the reduction of the 12-month average commodity prices during the year. In 2016, we incurred non-cash ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties of $161.6 million pre-tax ($100.6 million net of tax) due to the reduction of the 12-month average commodity prices during the first three quarters of the year. We did not have a ceiling test write-down for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Our Jazz Wilcox field in South Texas, which includes our Gilly, Segno, and Wildwood prospects and several smaller prospects, contained 26%, 24%, and 17% of our total proved reserves in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, expressed on an oil equivalent barrels basis. Our Mendota field, located in the Granite Wash play in the Texas Panhandle, include 13%, 14%, and 17%, respectively of our total proved reserves in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, expressed on an oil equivalent barrels basis. There are no other fields besides these that accounted for more than 15% of our proved reserves.
Oil, NGLs, and Natural Gas Reserves. The following table identifies our estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves:

Oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Estimates of those reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. We use Ryder Scott Company L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum consultants, to audit the reserves prepared by our reservoir engineers. Ryder Scott has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world since 1937. Their summary report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The wells or locations for which reserve estimates were audited were taken from our reserve and income projections as of December 31, 2016 and comprised 82% of the total proved developed future net income discounted at 10% and 83% of the total proved discounted future net income (based on the SEC's unescalated pricing policy).
Our Reservoir Engineering department is responsible for reserve determination for the wells in which we have an interest. Their primary objective is to estimate the wells' future reserves and future net value to us. Data is incorporated from multiple sources including geological, production engineering, marketing, production, land, and accounting departments. The engineers are responsible for reviewing this information for accuracy as it is incorporated into the reservoir engineering database. Our internal audit group reviews our internal controls to help provide assurance all the data has been provided. New well reserve estimates are provided to management as well as the respective operational divisions for additional scrutiny. Major reserve changes on existing wells are reviewed on a regular basis with the operational divisions to confirm completeness and accuracy. As the external audit is being completed by Ryder Scott, the reservoir department performs a final review of all properties for accuracy of forecasting.

For more information regarding Mr. Paradiso’s geographic and job specific experience, please refer to the Ryder Scott Company website at http://www.ryderscott.com/Company/Employees. 
The Company – Responsibility for overseeing the preparation of our reserve report is shared by our reservoir engineers Trenton Mitchell and Derek Smith.
Mr. Mitchell earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University in 1994. He has been an employee of Unit since 2002. Initially, he was the Outside Operated Engineer and since 2003 he has served in the capacity of Reservoir Engineer and in 2010 he was promoted to Manager of Reservoir Engineering. Before joining Unit, he served in a number of engineering field and technical support positions with Schlumberger Well Services in their pumping services segment (formerly Dowell Schlumberger). He obtained his Professional Engineer registration from the State of Oklahoma in 2004 and has been a member of SPE since 1991.
Mr. Smith received a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering with a Minor in Business from the University of Tulsa in 2005. He worked for Apache Corporation immediately thereafter in Production Engineering, then Reservoir Engineering, followed by Drilling Engineering for approximately one year each before moving to Corporate Reserves in 2008. He joined Unit in 2009 as a Corporate Reserves Engineer involved in reserve evaluation, acquisition appraisals, and prospect reviews with increasing levels of responsibility. He has been a member of SPE since 2000.
As part of their continuing education Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Smith have attended various seminars and forums to enhance their understanding of current standards and issues for reserves presentation. These forums have included those sponsored by various professional societies and professional service firms including Ryder Scott.
Definitions and Other. Proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves, as defined in SEC Rule 4-10(a), are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – before the time the contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of the reservoir considered as "proved" includes:

• | The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and


• | Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geosciences and engineering data.

In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as incurred in a well penetration unless geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
10

Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geosciences, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:

• | Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole;


• | The operation of an installed program in the reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and


• | The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the average of the prices over the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by the report, and is determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.
"Proved undeveloped" oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expense is required for completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. Under no circumstances can estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless those techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. As of December 31, 2016, we had 40 gross proved undeveloped wells all of which we plan to develop within five years of initial disclosure at a net estimated cost of approximately $123.8 million. The future estimated development costs necessary to develop our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2017—2021, as disclosed in our December 31, 2016 oil and natural gas reserve report, are shown below:

Year | Number of Gross Wells Planned | Estimated Development Cost (In millions)
2017 | 13 | | $ | 41.3 
2018 | 23 | | 80.2 | 
2019 | 4 | | 2.3 | 
2020 | — | | — | 
2021 | — | | — | 
 | 40 | | $ | 123.8

11

Our proved undeveloped reserves reported at December 31, 2016 did not include reserves that we did not expect to develop within five years of initial disclosure of those reserves. Below is a summary of changes to our proved undeveloped reserves during 2016: 

 | Oil (MMBbls) | | NGLs (MMBbls) | | Natural Gas (Bcf) | Total (MMBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves, January 1, 2016 | 2.0 | | | 6.5 | | 68.5 | | 19.9 | 
Extensions and discoveries | 1.5 | | | 2.3 | | 19.2 | | 7.0 | 
Converted to developed | (0.1 | ) | | — | | (0.1 | ) | (0.1 | )
Revisions of previous estimates | (0.4 | ) | | (2.8 | ) | (28.4 | ) | (8.0 | )
Sales of reserves | — | | | — | | (0.7 | ) | (0.1 | )
Proved undeveloped reserves, December 31, 2016 | 3.0 | | | 6.0 | | 58.5 | | 18.7 | 

During 2016, we converted one proved undeveloped well locations into a proved developed well at a cost of approximately $2.5 million. The downward revision in the table above to our previous estimates were due to a number of factors including the removal of proved undeveloped reserves that are not part of our five-year development plan due to the decline in prices causing them to be uneconomic to drill and also due to a reduction in anticipated future capital expenditures. 
Our estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the changes in quantities, and standardized measure of those reserves for the three years then ended, are shown in the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures included in Item 8 of this report.
Contracts. Our oil production is sold at or near our wells under purchase contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements customary in the oil industry. Our natural gas production is sold to intrastate and interstate pipelines as well as to independent marketing firms under contracts with terms generally ranging from one month to a year. Few of these contracts contain provisions for readjustment of price as most of them are market sensitive.
Customers. During 2016, sales to Sunoco Logistics and Valero Energy Corporation accounted for 24% and 11% of our oil and natural gas revenues, respectively. No other company accounted for more than 10% of our oil and natural gas revenues. During 2016, our mid-stream segment purchased $42.7 million of our natural gas and NGLs production and provided gathering and transportation services of $9.2 million. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between our mid-stream segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. In 2015 and 2014, we eliminated intercompany revenues of $65.2 million and $89.6 million, respectively, attributable to the intercompany purchase of our production of natural gas and NGLs as well as gathering and transportation services.
CONTRACT DRILLING
General. Our contract drilling business is conducted through Unit Drilling Company. Through this company we drill onshore oil and natural gas wells for our own account as well as other oil and natural gas companies. Our drilling operations are located in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and North Dakota. Until October 31, 2015, our drilling operations in Texas were conducted under Unit Texas Drilling L.L.C., a subsidiary of Unit Drilling Company. Effective October 31, 2015, that subsidiary was merged into Unit Drilling Company.

(2) | Represents the total revenues from our contract drilling segment divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs were used during the year.

Description and Location of Our Drilling Rigs. An on-shore drilling rig is composed of major equipment components like engines, drawworks or hoists, derrick or mast, substructure, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, top drives, and drill pipe. As a result of the normal wear and tear from operating 24 hours a day, several of the major components, like engines, mud pumps, top drives, and drill pipe, must be replaced or rebuilt on a periodic basis. Other major components, like the substructure, mast, and drawworks, can be used for extended periods of time with proper maintenance. We also own additional equipment used in the operation of our drilling rigs, including iron roughnecks, automated catwalks, skidding systems, large air compressors, trucks, and other support equipment. Our drilling rigs can be transferred between divisions.
The maximum depth capacities of our various drilling rigs range from 9,500 to 40,000 feet allowing us to cover a wide range of our customers drilling requirements. In 2016, 28 of our 94 drilling rigs were used in drilling services. 
The following table shows certain information about our drilling rigs (including their distribution) as of February 10, 2017:

Divisions | ContractedRigs | Non-ContractedRigs | | TotalRigs | AverageRatedDrillingDepth(ft)
Mid-Continent (1) | 22 | | 51 | | 73 | 17,185
Rocky Mountain | 6 | | 15 | | 21 | 19,929
Totals | 28 | | 66 | | 94 | 17,798

_________________________

(1) | In 2016, our Panhandle and Gulf Coast divisions were consolidated into the Mid-Continent division.

The cyclical nature of the contract drilling business is reflected in drilling rig utilization rates. Drilling rig utilization in 2014 saw an increase of 17 drilling rigs running, going from 65 drilling rigs at the start of the year to 82 drilling rigs in November. The last month of 2014 reflected the beginning of the downward market we have experienced the last two years. At the end of 2015, our active drilling rig count was 26. Then in 2016, utilization continued downward bottoming out in May at 13 operating drilling rigs and as commodity prices began improving during the remainder of the year, we exited 2016 with 21 active rigs. 
Mid-Continent. 2016’s low level of utilization brought further consolidation of this segment's operating divisions. The Gulf Coast and Texas Panhandle divisions were rolled into the Mid-Continent division under a single management team. The Mid-Continent division manages operations from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Kansas. The division operated an average of 11.7 drilling rigs during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, this division was operating 15 drilling rigs, 10 of which were working in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle and five in the Permian Basin of West Texas.
Rocky Mountains. Our Rocky Mountain division covers Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota. This vast area has produced a number of conventional and unconventional oil and gas fields. This division operated an average of 
13

5.7 drilling rigs during 2016. We had two drilling rigs operating in the Pinedale Anticline of western Wyoming, three drilling rigs operating in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota, and one drilling rig operating in the Niobrara play in eastern Colorado at the end of 2016. 
At any given time the number of drilling rigs we can work depends on a number of conditions besides demand, including the availability of qualified labor and the availability of needed drilling supplies and equipment. The impact of these conditions tends to affect the demand for our drilling rigs. Our average utilization rate for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 19%, 38%, and 63%, respectively.
The following table shows the average number of our drilling rigs working by quarter for the years indicated: 

 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
First quarter | 20.6 | | 50.1 | | 67.9
Second quarter | 13.5 | | 30.7 | | 73.5
Third quarter | 16.0 | | 31.2 | | 79.1
Fourth quarter | 19.5 | | 27.2 | | 80.9

Drilling Rig Fleet. The following table summarizes the changes to our drilling rig fleet in 2016. A more complete discussion of changes over the last three years follows the table: 

Drilling rigs available for use at December 31, 2015 | 94 | 
Drilling rigs sold | (1 | )
Drilling rigs constructed | 1 | 
Total drilling rigs available for use at December 31, 2016 | 94 | 

Dispositions, Acquisitions, and Construction.  During the first quarter of 2014, we sold four idle 3,000 horsepower drilling rigs to an unaffiliated third party. The proceeds from that sale were used in our construction program for our new proprietary 1,500 horsepower, AC electric drilling rig, called the BOSS drilling rig. 
During 2014, three BOSS drilling rigs were constructed and placed into service for third-party operators. 
In December 2014, we removed from service 31 drilling rigs, some older top drives, and certain drill pipe no longer marketable in the current environment and based on the estimated market value from third-party assessments, we recorded a write-down of approximately $74.3 million, pre-tax. During 2015, we recorded an additional write-down on the drilling rigs and other equipment of approximately $8.3 million pre-tax based on the estimated market value from similar auctions. We sold all 31 of these drilling rigs and some other drilling equipment to unaffiliated third parties. The proceeds from the sale of those assets, less costs to sell, was less than the $11.3 million net book value resulting in a loss of $7.3 million pre-tax. 
During 2015, five BOSS drilling rigs were constructed and placed into service for third-party operators. 
During December 2016, we sold an idle 1,500 horsepower SCR drilling rig to an unaffiliated third party. We also built and placed into service for a third party operator our ninth BOSS drilling rig. This new BOSS rig was constructed using the long lead time components purchased in prior years.
Drilling Contracts. Our drilling contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding on a well by well basis. Contract terms and payment rates vary depending on the type of contract used, the duration of the work, the equipment and services supplied, and other matters. We pay certain operating expenses, including the wages of our drilling rig personnel, maintenance expenses, and incidental drilling rig supplies and equipment. The contracts are usually subject to early termination by the customer subject to the payment of a fee. Our contracts also contain provisions regarding indemnification against certain types of claims involving injury to persons, property, and for acts of pollution. The specific terms of these indemnifications are subject to negotiation on a contract by contract basis.
The type of contract used determines our compensation. Contracts are generally one of three types: daywork; footage; or turnkey. Under a daywork contract, we provide the drilling rig with the required personnel and the operator supervises the drilling of the well. Our compensation is based on a negotiated rate to be paid for each day the drilling rig is used. Footage contracts usually require us to bear some of the drilling costs in addition to providing the drilling rig. We are paid on 
14

completion of the well at a negotiated rate for each foot drilled. Under turnkey contracts we drill the well to a specified depth for a set amount and provide most of the required equipment and services. We bear the risk of drilling the well to the contract depth and are paid when the contract provisions are completed. We may incur losses if we underestimate the costs to drill the well or if unforeseen events occur that increase our costs or result in the loss of the well. We did not have any footage or turnkey contracts in 2016, 2015, or 2014. Because market demand for our drilling rigs as well as the desires of our customers determine the types of contracts we use, we cannot predict when and if a part of our drilling will be conducted under footage or turnkey contracts.
The majority of our contracts are on a well-to-well basis, with the rest under term contracts. Term contracts range from six months to two years and the rates can either be fixed throughout the term or allow for periodic adjustments.
Customers. During 2016, QEP Resources, Inc. and Whiting Petroleum Corporation were our largest drilling customers accounting for approximately 28% and 18%, respectively, of our total contract drilling revenues. Our work for these customers were under multiple contracts and our business was not substantially dependent on any of these individual contracts. Consequently, none of these individual contracts were considered to be material. No other third party customer accounted for 10% or more of our contract drilling revenues.
Our contract drilling segment also provides drilling services for our oil and natural gas segment. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, our contract drilling segment drilled 10, 38, and 134 wells, respectively, for our oil and natural gas segment, or 3%, 7%, and 15%, respectively, of the total wells drilled by our contract drilling segment. Depending on the timing of the drilling services performed on our properties those services may be deemed, for financial reporting purposes, to be associated with the acquisition of an ownership interest in the property. Revenues and expenses for these services are eliminated in our statement of operations, with any profit recognized reducing our investment in our oil and natural gas properties. The contracts for these services are issued under the similar terms and rates as the contracts entered into with unrelated third parties. We did not eliminate any revenue or expenses in our contract drilling segment during 2016. By providing drilling services for the oil and natural gas segment, we eliminated revenue of $22.1 million and $89.5 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, from our contract drilling segment and eliminated the associated operating expense of $18.3 million and $62.4 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, yielding $3.8 million and $27.1 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a reduction to the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.
MID-STREAM
General. Our mid-stream operations are conducted through Superior Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and its subsidiaries. Its operations consist of buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating natural gas. It operates three natural gas treatment plants, 13 processing plants, 25 active gathering systems, and approximately 1,465 miles of pipeline. Superior and its subsidiaries operate in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
The following table presents certain information regarding our mid-stream segment for the years indicated: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Gas gathered—Mcf/day | 419,217 | | 353,771 | | 319,348
Gas processed—Mcf/day | 155,461 | | 182,684 | | 161,282
NGLs sold—gallons/day | 536,494 | | 577,513 | | 733,406

Dispositions and Acquisitions. This segment did not have any significant dispositions or acquisitions during 2014, 2015, or 2016.
In 2014, our mid-stream segment had a $7.1 million pre-tax write-down of three of its systems, Weatherford, Billy Rose, and Spring Creek and in 2015, incurred a $27.0 million pre-tax write-down of its systems, Bruceton Mills, Spring Creek, and Midwell due to anticipated future cash flow and future development around these systems not being sufficient to support their carrying value. The estimated future cash flows were less than the carrying value on these systems. 
15

Contracts. Our mid-stream segment provides its customers with a full range of gathering, processing, and treating services. These services are usually provided to each customer under long-term contracts (more than one year), but we do have some short-term contracts as well. Our customer agreements include the following types of contracts: 

• | Fee-Based Contracts. These contracts provide for a set fee for gathering, transporting, compressing, and treating services. Our mid-stream’s revenue is a function of the volume of natural gas and is not directly dependent on the value of the natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 76% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 71% of its operating margins (as defined below) were under fee-based contracts. 


• | Commodity-Based Contracts. These contracts consist of several contract structure types. Under these contract structures, our mid-stream segment purchases the raw well-head natural gas and settles with the producer at a stipulated price while retaining all sales proceeds from third parties or retains a negotiated percentage of the sales proceeds from the residue natural gas and NGLs it gathers and processes, with the remainder being paid to the producer. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 24% of our mid-stream segment’s total volumes and 29% of operating margins (as defined below) were under commodity-cased contracts. 

For each of the above contracts, operating margin is defined as total operating revenues less operating expenses and does not include depreciation, amortization, and impairment, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, or income taxes.
Customers. During 2016, ONEOK Partners, L.P., Koch Energy Services, LLC, Range Resources Corporation, and Tenaska Resources, LLC, accounted for approximately 30%, 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of our mid-stream revenues. We believe that if we lost any of these identified customers, there are other customers available to purchase our gas and NGLs. During 2016, 2015, and 2014 this segment purchased $42.7 million, $57.6 million, and $80.9 million, respectively, of our oil and natural gas segment's natural gas and NGLs production, and provided gathering and transportation services of $9.2 million, $7.6 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. Intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production between this business segment and our oil and natural gas segment has been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
VOLATILE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
The prevailing prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas significantly affect our revenues, operating results, cash flow as well as our ability to grow our operations. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices have been volatile and we expect them to continue to be so. For each of the periods indicated, the following table shows the highest and lowest average prices our oil and natural gas segment received for its sales of oil, NGLs, and natural gas without taking into account the effect of derivatives: 

 | Oil Price per Bbl | | NGLs Price per Bbl | Natural Gas Price per Mcf

16

Prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the actual or perceived supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:

• | political conditions in oil producing regions;


• | the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on prices and their ability or willingness to maintain production quotas;


• | actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations;


• | the price of foreign oil imports;


• | imports and exports of oil and liquefied natural gas;


• | actions of governmental authorities;


• | the domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;


• | the level of consumer demand;


• | United States storage levels of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;


• | weather conditions;


• | domestic and foreign government regulations;


• | the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels;


• | volatility in ethane prices causing rejection of ethane as part of the liquids processed stream; and


• | worldwide economic conditions.

These factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas. You are encouraged to read the Risk Factors discussed in Item 1A of this report for additional risks that can impact our operations.
Our contract drilling operations are dependent on the level of demand in our operating markets. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices affect demand. Because oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are volatile, the level of demand for our services can also be volatile. 
Our mid-stream operations provide us greater flexibility in delivering our (and third parties) natural gas and NGLs from the wellhead to major natural gas and NGLs pipelines. Margins received for the delivery of these natural gas and NGLs are dependent on the price for oil, NGLs, and natural gas and the demand for natural gas and NGLs in our area of operations. If the price of NGLs falls without a corresponding decrease in the cost of natural gas, it may become uneconomical to us to extract certain NGLs. The volumes of natural gas and NGLs processed are highly dependent on the volume and Btu content of the natural gas and NGLs gathered.
COMPETITION
All of our businesses are highly competitive and price sensitive. Competition in the contract drilling business traditionally involves factors such as demand, price, efficiency, condition of equipment, availability of labor and equipment, reputation, and customer relations.
Our oil and natural gas operations likewise encounter strong competition from other oil and natural gas companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and have more experience than we do in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas.
Our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, during times of increased competition on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for these professionals can, at times, be extremely intense.
17

Our mid-stream segment competes with purchasers and gatherers of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies, as well as independent gatherers for the right to purchase natural gas and NGLs, build gathering and processing systems, and deliver the natural gas and NGLs once the gathering and processing systems are established. The principal elements of competition include the rates, terms, and availability of services, reputation, and the flexibility and reliability of service.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROGRAMS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Unit Petroleum Company serves as the general partner of 13 oil and gas limited partnerships (the employee partnerships) which were formed to allow certain of our qualified employees and our directors to participate in Unit Petroleum’s oil and gas exploration and production operations. Employee partnerships were formed for each year beginning with 1984 and ending with 2011. In addition, we also had three non-employee partnerships, one formed in 1984 and two formed in 1986 (investments by third parties). Effective December 31, 2014, the 1984 partnership was dissolved and effective December 31, 2016, the two 1986 partnerships were also dissolved. 
The employee partnerships formed in 1984 through 1999 have been combined into a single consolidated partnership. The employee partnerships each have a set annual percentage (ranging from 1% to 15%) of our interest that the partnership acquires in most of the oil and natural gas wells we drill or acquire for our own account during the year in which the partnership was formed. The total interest the participants have in our oil and natural gas wells by participating in these partnerships does not exceed one percent of our interest in the wells.
Under the terms of our partnership agreements, the general partner has broad discretionary authority to manage the business and operations of the partnership, including the authority to make decisions regarding the partnership’s participation in a drilling location or a property acquisition, the partnership’s expenditure of funds, and the distribution of funds to partners. Because the business activities of the limited partners and the general partner are not the same, conflicts of interest will exist and it is not possible to entirely eliminate these conflicts. Additionally, conflicts of interest may arise when we are the operator of an oil and natural gas well and also provide contract drilling services. In these cases, the drilling operations are conducted under drilling contracts containing terms and conditions comparable to those contained in our drilling contracts with non-affiliated operators. We believe we fulfill our responsibility to each contracting party and comply fully with the terms of the agreements which regulate these conflicts.
These partnerships are further described in Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 10, 2017, we had approximately 746 employees in our contract drilling segment, 266 employees in our oil and natural gas segment, 125 employees in our mid-stream segment, and 79 in our general corporate area. None of our employees are members of a union or labor organization nor have our operations ever been interrupted by a strike or work stoppage. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
General. Our business depends on the demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, and therefore our business can be affected by political developments and changes in laws and regulations that control or curtail drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, or other policy reasons.
Various state and federal regulations affect the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states in which we conduct activities impose varying restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas. The following discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting our operations should not be relied upon as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting us, due to the multitude of complex federal, state, and local regulations, and their susceptibility to change by subsequent agency actions and court rulings, that may affect our operations.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales has been substantially modified by the Natural Gas Policy Act under which FERC continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in “first sales” in interstate and intrastate commerce. Effective January 1, 1993, however, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the Decontrol Act) deregulated natural gas prices 
18

for all “first sales” of natural gas. Because “first sales” include typical wellhead sales by producers, all natural gas produced from our natural gas properties is sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts which may be in effect. FERC’s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas transportation is not affected by the Decontrol Act.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Beginning in 1985, FERC adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. These changes are intended by FERC to foster competition by, among other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of gas transporters. All natural gas marketing by the pipelines is required to divest to a marketing affiliate, which operates separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants. As a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late 1980s and the subsequent individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid-1990s, interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to all producers, natural gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users, and other customers seeking service. Through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services, FERC expanded the impact of open access regulations to certain aspects of intrastate commerce.
FERC has pursued other policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing. Most notable are (1) the large-scale divestiture of interstate pipeline-owned gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies; (2) further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates; (3) the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis; (4) further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market; and (5) development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market-based rates (rather than traditional cost-of-service based rates) for transportation or transportation-related services upon the pipeline’s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market. 
As a result of these changes, independent sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counter parties. We believe these changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while, at the same time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. However, we cannot predict what new or different regulations FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on production and marketing of natural gas from our properties.
Although in the past Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation as discussed above, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation and the promotion of competition in the natural gas industry. Thus, in addition to “first sales” deregulation, Congress also repealed incremental pricing requirements and natural gas use restraints previously applicable. There continually are legislative proposals pending in the Federal and state legislatures which, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, these proposals might have on the production and marketing of natural gas by us. Similarly, and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on the production and marketing of natural gas by us cannot be predicted.
Oil and Natural Gas Liquids Sales and Transportation. Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are at market prices. The prices received from the sale of these products are affected by the cost of transporting these products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments could result in decreased rates in a given year. These regulations have generally been approved on judicial review. Every five years, FERC examines the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry and makes any necessary adjustment in the index to be used during the ensuing five years. We are not able to predict with certainty what effect, if any, the periodic review of the index by FERC will have on us.
Exploration and Production Activities. Federal, state, and local agencies also have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. The states we operate in require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and the filing of reports concerning operations and impose other requirements 
19

relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging and, abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws.
Environmental.
General. Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may require acquisition of permits before certain of our operations may be commenced and may restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment. Planning and implementation of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids, and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are subject to regulatory requirements.
The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and their state counterparts, are the primary vehicles for imposition of such requirements and for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. In addition, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of remedial action as well as damages to natural resources.
The EPA in 2015 established publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) effluent guidelines and standards for oil and gas extraction facilities which reflected current industry best practices for unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities.
The EPA and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers in 2015 proposed a new expansive definition of the “waters of the United States,” which rules has been stayed by courts pending conformity with the definition the United States Supreme Court previously established and whether such changes can be appealed by a person or entity directly to a United States Court of Appeals. In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers includes wetlands within its definition of “waters of the United States.” In 2016, the United States Supreme Court in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes held that landowners can challenge in court an Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional determination. It is anticipated that this decision will provide landowners an important tool in negotiating and resolving conflicts with federal agencies over the extent of wetlands on a property. 
Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act, referred to as the “ESA,” and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators and service companies to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas. All three of our business segments could be subject to the effect of one or more species being listed as threatened or endangered within the areas of our operations. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future undertake operations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries in 2016 issued final revised definitions relating to impacts on critical habitats for potentially endangered species allowing exclusion of certain areas so long as they will not result in the extinction of the species. The presence of protected species in areas where we provide contract drilling or mid-stream services or conduct exploration and production operations could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those services and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Climate Change.  Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. As a result there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements, and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States (as well as other parts of the World) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases.
In 2007, the United States Supreme Court in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an “air pollutant” under the federal Clean Air Act if it represents a health hazard to the public. On December 7, 2009, the U.S. 
20

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded to the Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and that certain GHGs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of GHG and hence to the threat of climate change. In addition, the EPA issued a final rule, effective in December 2009, requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large (25,000 metric tons or more) GHG emission sources in the U.S., beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. During 2010, the EPA proposed revisions to these reporting requirements to apply to all oil and gas production, transmission, processing, and other facilities exceeding certain emission thresholds. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued three final rules that together will curb emissions of methane, smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and toxic air-pollutants such as benzene from new, reconstructed and modified oil and natural gas sources, while providing greater certainty about Clean Air Act permitting requirements for the industry. First, the EPA issued updates to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the oil and natural gas industry to add requirements that the industry reduce emissions of GHGs and to cover additional equipment and activities in the oil and natural gas distribution chain by setting emissions limits for methane and to require owners/operators to find and repair methane and VOC leaks. Second, the EPA issued a source determination rule with respect to the EPA’s air permitting rules as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA clarified when multiple pieces of equipment and activities must be deemed a single source for determining whether (i) major source Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review requirements apply with respect to preconstruction permitting and (ii) a Title V Operating permit is required. Third, the EPA issued a final rule to implement the Minor New Source Review Program in Indian Country for oil and natural gas production designed to limit emissions of harmful air pollution while making the preconstruction permitting process more streamlined and efficient. These regulations will result in additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and possibly could adversely affect demand for the crude oil we gather, transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our services. 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our oil and natural gas segment routinely applies hydraulic fracturing techniques to many of our oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Marmaton of Oklahoma, the Wilcox of Texas, and the Mississippian of Kansas. A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has been conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Legislation has previously been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. The U.S. House of Representatives has previously passed a bill that would block the Department of Interior from regulating hydraulic fracturing in states that already have their own regulations in place; however, it is uncertain that such an act will ever be enacted. In addition, certain states in which we operate, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming have adopted, and other states as well as municipalities and other local governmental entities in some states, have and others are considering adopting regulations and ordinances that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure of fracking fluids, waste disposal, and well construction requirements on these operations, and even restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. 
On December 31, 2016, the EPA released its scientific Final Report on Impacts from Hydraulic Fracturing Activities on Drinking Water. The EPA states the report, which was done at the request of Congress, provides scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources in the United States under some circumstances. The EPA identifies six conditions under which impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities can be more frequent or severe as well as existing uncertainties and data gaps. Both the EPA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have made statements indicating that activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may be causing earthquakes, with the focus being on wastewater disposal wells rather than injection wells. In an August 2015 report sent to the Texas Railroad Commission, the EPA stated it believes there is a significant possibility that North Texas earthquake activity is associated with disposal wells. The USGS has stated that hydraulic fracturing causes extremely small earthquakes, but they are almost always too small to be detected. With respect to disposal wells, the USGS has stated that the injection of wastewater and salt water by deep wells into the subsurface can cause earthquakes that are large enough to be felt and may cause damage. As a result, the USGS and its university partners have deployed seismometers at sites of known or possible injection induced earthquakes in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas and that it is also developing methods to assess the earthquake hazard associated with wastewater injection wells. 
Any new laws, regulation, or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to operational delay, or increased operating costs or third party or governmental claims, and could result in additional burdens that could serve to delay or limit the drilling services we provide to third parties whose drilling operations could be impacted by these regulations or increase our costs of compliance and doing business as well as delay the development of unconventional gas resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.

Other; Compliance Costs. We cannot predict future legislation or regulations. It is possible that some future laws, regulations, and/or ordinances could result in increasing our compliance costs or additional operating restrictions as well as those of our customers. It is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels which could adversely affect the demand for our services, which in turn could adversely affect our future results of operations. Likewise we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature, storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change (or otherwise) will have a material impact on our operations.
Compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not, to date, had a material effect on the cost of our operations, earnings, or competitive position. However, as noted above in connection with our discussion of the regulation of GHGs and hydraulic fracturing, compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
Historically, our revenues from our Canadian operations, as well as information relating to long-lived assets attributable to those operations were immaterial. We no longer have any interests there or any other international operations.
