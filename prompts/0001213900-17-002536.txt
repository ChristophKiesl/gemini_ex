Business Overview
 
We design, develop, market and sell lighter-than-air (“LTA”) advanced aerostats, tethered drones, and land-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”) solutions. We focus on the development of a tethered aerostat known as the Winch Aerostat Small Platform (“WASP”), as well as tethered drone products, including the WATT and BOLT electric tethered drones launched on March 2, 2015 and July 13, 2016, respectively. The WATT and BOLT products are designed for commercial and military applications and provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether.
Products
 
We develop a lighter-than-air advanced tethered aerostat known as the WASP and tethered drone products, including the WATT and the BOLT tethered drones. The WASP tethered aerostat system is a lighter-than-air, compact aerostat platform that is either self-contained on a trailer that can be towed by a military all-terrain vehicle, or “MATV,” or mine resistant ambush protected vehicle, or “MRAP,” or other standard vehicle, or operated from the bed of a pickup truck. It is designed to provide semi-persistent, mobile, real-time day/night high definition footage for ISR, detection of improvised explosive devices, border security and other governmental and civilian uses. All of our products can also be utilized for disaster response missions by supporting two-way and cellular communications and acting as a repeater or provider of wireless networking. 


The aerostat systems have a tethered envelope filled with helium gas, either a stabilized ISR payload or communications payload, portable ground control station and a datalink between the ground station and the envelope. Hovering at up to 2,000 feet above the ground, the systems provide surveillance and communications capabilities with relatively low acquisition and maintenance costs.  The systems require an operational crew of a minimum of two personnel, relatively simple maintenance procedures, and a quick retrieval and helium top-off for re-inflation.
 
The WASP is a mobile, tactical-sized aerostat capable of carrying a variety of payloads in support of military operations helping troops in the field have a tactical edge while communicating over greater distances. The WASP leverages aerostat technology to elevate network payloads to an advantaged height to enable persistent network connectivity while reducing risk to units conducting missions. U.S. Army-owned WASP tactical aerostats have undergone and successfully completed a number of field tests and exercises, including the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) Enterprise Challenge, Stormforce Exercise, and various Army Network Integration Evaluations, which allows the U.S. Government to evaluate, among other things, the WASP’s ability to provide secure communications and capture and relay real-time, high definition video to various handheld devices, tablet computers and other deployed systems. In March 2016, we were awarded a contract from a U.S. Government customer for our WASP tactical aerostats, which were delivered in August 2016. As a result of our ongoing relationship with our U.S. Government customers, we will continue to support the U.S. Army-owned WASP systems for future operations and exercises.

WATT was our first model of a new line of commercial-grade electric tethered drones designed to provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being connected to a ground-based, software-controlled winch via a safe and secure armored tether line. In September 2016, we were awarded a contract from a U.S. Government customer for our WATT tethered drones, which were delivered in December 2016. The concept of the tethered drone system is built on the strength of our experience in developing tethered solutions for our aerostat products and combining that with the advantages of multi-rotor copters. The result is a robust capability designed to be used in almost all weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. The WATT is designed to take off, hover and land via remote control while connected by a unique tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on in our launcher systems are being incorporated into the self-contained copter system in order to produce a heavier-than-air, tethered product. The WATT is a complete turnkey system that can be launched within minutes of unpacking from a standard case stored in a host vehicle. Once launched, WATT is designed to hover in a stationary position directly above its launch site at one of several preset altitudes of up to 300 feet for up to 8 hours while a highly-stabilized military-grade/broadcast quality HD video image can provide a 360° live aerial monitoring feed directly through the tether to its host vehicle or to a network of mobile devices, such as tablets or laptop computers. Compact and lightweight, the WATT system features the ability to draw power from both its host vehicle or independently provide up to 8 hours of operation through its own ground power equipment that is specially designed to be transported and deployed from commercial vehicles, such as TV production trucks, first responder vehicles and common agriculture/infrastructure equipment using its standard 120 volt adapter.
 
On July 13, 2016, we announced the official launch of the BOLT platform, the newest addition to our tethered drone portfolio. Designed to meet a wide range of military applications requiring persistent, heavy lift capabilities, the BOLT coaxial tethered helicopter delivers rapid setup, high mobility and whisper-quiet operations at altitudes of up to 800 feet. BOLT has a field changeable universal payload bay which supports radio, signals intelligence, or “SIGINT,” and ISR packages of up to 15 pounds and requiring up to 1 kilowatt of power. BOLT was unveiled at ADS, Inc.’s Warrior Expo East industry conference event on July 14, 2016. The Company has received initial interest from a select number of potential customers since the introduction and plans to custom manufacture each vehicle based on order specifications it receives in the future.
 
Market
 
The market for our LTA advanced aerostats and tethered drones has grown significantly over the last several years and has seen interest increase significantly following the adoption of new commercial drone regulations (Part 107) adopted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) at the end of August 2016 because our tethered drone product line is designed to comply with the FAA’s regulations. The military has transformed into a smaller, more agile fighting force in need of a network of technologies to provide improved observation, communication and precision targeting of combat troop locations, which are often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations.  Our products provide critical observation and communication capabilities serving the increased demand for ISR and communications, including real-time tactical reconnaissance, tracking, combat assessment and geographic data, while reducing the risks to our troops in theatre. Finally, in a highly constrained fiscal environment, we believe the typically lower acquisition and use/maintenance costs of LTA advanced aerostats and tethered drones make them more appealing compared to their heavier than air manned or larger LTA unmanned system alternatives. 
 
The markets for our systems on a stand-alone basis and/or combined with other payloads relates to the following applications, among others:

We believe the current market competitors to the WASP aerostat system include a large number of companies ranging from small “mom and pop” tethered aerostat and balloon companies to large defense contractors, including TCOM, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ISL, ILC Dover, Compass Systems, Raven Aerostar and American Blimp Corporation. We believe there are numerous commercial drone companies, such as DJI and Parrot, offering free flying drones for pleasure and commercial use, as well as many larger drone manufactures, such as Northrop Grumman, AeroVironment, Inc. and Boeing, offering military grade free flying drones to the U.S. Government, which could compete with the WASP. There are very few commercial grade tethered drone competitors for our WATT and BOLT tethered drone systems that remain tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether, including Cyphy Works Inc. located in Danvers, MA, Elistair located in Lyon, France, Hoverfly Technologies, Inc. located in Orlando, Florida and Skysapience located in Yokneam, Israel.
 
Many of our LTA aerostat competitors have received considerable funding from government or government-related sources to develop and build LTA aerostats.  Most of these organizations and many of our other competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources and capabilities than we do. We anticipate increasing competition as a result of defense industry consolidation, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position and ability to compete against us.  In addition, other companies may introduce competing aerostats or solutions based on alternative technologies that may adversely affect our competitive position.  As a result, our products may become less or non-competitive or obsolete. For further discussion of certain risks relating to competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
Technology, Research and Development
 
We conduct the development, commercialization and construction of the WATT and BOLT tethered drones and WASP aerostat systems in-house. 
 
Our research and development efforts are largely focused on the tethered drone systems and LTA aerostat systems.  We have developed a “non-military spec” aerostat system for use in more commercial or governmental applications that does not require the level of durability and ruggedness of the current militarized model, and we continue to work on different models with different payloads for various applications.
 
The concept of the WATT and BOLT systems are built on the strength of our years of developing tethered solutions for our LTA aerostat products combined with the advantages of rotor copters. The result is a robust product designed to be utilized in almost all weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. Our tethered drones are designed to take off, hover and land via remote control all while being connected by a unique tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on from our launcher systems are incorporated into our self-contained tethered drone systems in order to produce a unique heavier than air, tethered product offering.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we spent $1,218,614 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we spent $744,452 on research and development activities. Research and development expenditures are not borne directly by customers nor are the costs accounted for in our pricing models.
 
Strategic Partners 
 
We are party to several agreements with strategic partners and distributors to assist us with the marketing and sales of various products, as we currently have limited in-house sales capabilities. Current relationships include:

● | A sales and distribution partnership with U.S. government prime contractor ADS Inc.; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A solution development arrangement with Infor for the integration of the WATT tethered drone and Infor’s Enterprise Asset Management system; 
● | A Master Partner Agreement with Adobe Systems Incorporated to collect video streams for analytics; and 
● | A three-year marketing and integration partnership commenced in March 2015 with L3 Communications Corporation for a “L3-Branded” WASP targeting prime contract customers.

Intellectual Property
 
On September 18 and 19, 2014, we filed provisional patent application numbers “62/052,289” and “62/052,946” entitled “Tethered Portable Aerial Media broadcast System” based on the tethered drone system. On September 18, 2015, we filed a utility patent application claiming a priority date of the two provisional patent applications and having application Serial Number “14858467” entitled “Apparatus and Methods for Tethered Aerial Platform and System.” On July 7, 2015, we filed a provisional patent application number “62/189,341” entitled “Apparatus, Methods and System for Tethered Aerial Platform.” On September 20, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued patent number 9,446,858 entitled “Apparatus and methods for tethered aerial platform and system.” This new patent on our electric tethered aerial platform (“ETAP”) technologies covers the core systems currently incorporated into the WATT and BOLT products. On December 5, 2016, we filed provisional patent application number “62/430,195” entitled “System for Converting an Onboard Battery Powered Drone to a Ground Powered Tethered Drone.”
 
In addition, the Company’s intellectual property portfolio includes an exclusive commercial license to vision-based navigation and advanced autonomous flight management software that it acquired in 2015 and exclusive commercial licenses to a number of unmanned vehicle technologies developed by Georgia Tech Research Corporation, including “GUST” (Georgia Tech UAV Simulation Tool) autopilot system.
 
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As we continue the development of the tethered drone and aerostat systems, we expect that we will rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered the trademark “Blimp in a Box.”  In certain cases, when appropriate, we opt to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets as opposed to filing for patent protection in order to preserve confidentiality.  All of our employees are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. For further discussion about the intellectual property rights and licenses and minimum royalties, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes.
 
Dependence on a Few Customers and Regulatory Matters
 
We believe there is a large, growing market for our commercial tethered drones internationally as well as in the U.S. With the recently enacted guidelines for commercial drone use in the U.S. by the FAA (Part 107), we have witnessed a growing U.S. market for commercial drone applications that our tethered drones can serve. Until the FAA officially adopted and published these guidelines in late August 2016, we and our customers were restricted to operating our tethered drones in the National Air Space under either FAA granted exemptions or Certificates of Authorization. In addition to domestic opportunities, we are evaluating various international markets where the FAA does not control the airspace and where our tethered drones can potentially be operated. We anticipate that the majority of our LTA aerostat revenue at least in the foreseeable future will come from U.S. Government and Government-related entities, including the DoD and other departments and agencies.  Government programs that we may seek to participate in compete with other programs for consideration during Congress’s budget and appropriations hearings, and may be affected by changes not only in political power and appointments, but also general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.  Reductions, extensions or terminations in a program that we are seeking to participate in or overall defense spending could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and realize any profits.  We cannot predict whether potential changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities will afford opportunities for our business in terms of research and development or product contracts, but any reduction in government spending on such programs could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.

We have registered as a contractor with the U.S. Government and are required to comply with and will be affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.  Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business.  A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of any then existing contracts, or the inability to bid on future contracts.  For further discussion of the risks relating to U.S. Government contracts and FAA rules and regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. For further discussion about our dependence on a few major customers see Note 13 – Concentrations in the Notes.
 
International sales of our products may also be subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies like the U.S. Department of State restrictions on the transfer of technology, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and other export laws and regulations and may be subject to first obtaining licenses, clearances or authorizations from various regulatory entities.   This may limit our ability to sell our products abroad and the failure to comply with any of these regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and generate revenues as well as increase our operating costs.  Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate wireless communications. 
 
Sources and Availability of Components

Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom made for those products and are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement supplier’s components is inferior or unacceptable.  For further discussion of the risks relating to sources and availability of components, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
Employees

We have 21 full-time and two part-time employees. Our executive management and accounting team are comprised of four of those full-time employees and two part-time consultants. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.
