Item 1.    Business
General:
Regis Corporation owns, franchises and operates beauty salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "RGS." Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the "Company," "we," "our," or "us," we are referring to Regis Corporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2017, the Company-owned, franchised or held ownership interests in 9,008 locations worldwide. The Company's locations consist of 8,919 company-owned and franchised salons and 89 locations in which we maintain a non-controlling ownership interest of less than 100%. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar salon products and services and serve the mass marketplace.
The major services supplied by the Company's salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning), hair coloring and other services. Service revenues comprise approximately 80% of total company-owned revenues. The percentage of company-owned service revenues in fiscal year 2017 attributable to haircutting and styling, hair coloring and other services were 74%, 20% and 6%, respectively. 
The Company reports its operations in four operating segments: North American Value, North American Franchise, North American Premium and International. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. The Company's North American Value salon operations are comprised of 5,439 company-owned salons operating in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and Puerto Rico. The Company's North American Franchise salon operations are comprised of 2,633 franchised salons operating in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The Company's North American Premium salon operations are comprised of 559 company-owned salons operating in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. The Company's International operations are comprised of 275 company-owned salons and 13 franchised salons in the United Kingdom. The Company's salons operate primarily under the trade names of SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Regis Salons, and Cost Cutters, and they generally serve two categories within the industry, value and premium. SmartStyle, Supercuts, MasterCuts, Cost Cutters, and other regional trade names are generally within the value category, offering high quality, convenience, and affordably priced hair care and beauty services and retail products. Regis Salons, among other trade names, are in the premium category, offering upscale hair care and beauty services and retail products. The Company's North American Value and North American Franchise businesses are located mainly in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters and the North American Premium business is primarily in mall-based locations. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the number of guest visits at the Company's company-owned salons approximated 67 and 72 million, respectively. 
Financial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 are included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
In fiscal year 2017, we announced plans to expand the franchise side of our business, through organic growth and by selling certain company-owned salons to franchisees over time. In January 2017, we began franchising the SmartStyle brand throughout the U.S. for the first time, and entered into agreements to sell 233 of our company-owned salons across our brands to new and existing franchisees, of which not all have closed as of June 30, 2017.
Industry Overview:
The hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently owned and operated. However, the influence of salon chains, both franchised and company-owned, continues to grow within this market. Management believes salon chains will continue to have significant influence on this market and will continue to increase their presence.
In every area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar prices. The Company faces competition from smaller chains of salons such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, Sport Clips and Ulta Beauty, independently owned salons, department store salons located within malls, in-home hair services, booth rentals and blow dry bars.
At the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to establish systems and infrastructure, to recruit experienced field and salon management and stylists, and to lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality and consistency of the guest experience, convenience, location and price. The Company continually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of brand differentiation versus the competition.

Strategy:
The Company is focused on maximizing shareholder value. In order to successfully maximize shareholder value we place a balanced approach to our guests, employees and stylists, franchisees and shareholders. Our strategy and priorities are focused on loving our guests and stylists and initiatives to enhance shareholder value. Achieving our strategy requires a disciplined and thoughtful approach to investing and disinvesting in programming. We are focused on accelerating the growth of our franchise business while materially improving the performance of our company-owned salons. 
Since the appointment of Hugh Sawyer as Chief Executive Officer in April 2017, the Company has executed a 120-day plan and other initiatives to help stabilize performance and establish a platform for longer term revenue and earnings growth in company-owned salons in order to maximize shareholder value. The core components of the 120-day plan are focused on improving upon our performance by better aligning company resources to demand while continuing to provide an exceptional guest experience, simplification of our business to grow revenues and disinvestment of certain programs that do not create value. As part of the 120-day plan, the Company has appointed several new key executives and personnel, including President of Franchise, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Vice President of Walmart Relations and Vice President Creative. To date, the initial returns on the Company's 120-day plan and other initiatives have been favorable and it is anticipated that these favorable year-over-year returns will continue to build in fiscal year 2018. 
In order to continue providing an exceptional guest experience, we are investing in salon technology by launching SmartStyle online same-day check-in, which allows our guests in Walmart locations to find a location near them, view wait times, check-in via our website or mobile app and upgrading our point-of-sale (POS) hardware to facilitate an efficient guest experience within the salons and deploying tablets in corporate-owned salons to open a channel of direct communication with our stylists, including technical education. 
To maximize shareholder value, we are focused on simplification, variable labor management, quality revenue growth, and the allocation of our capital to value-maximizing initiatives. Our business historically has been structured geographically. To simplify and better focus our business on our guests, effective August 1, 2017, we re-aligned the existing field leadership team into four distinct field organizations based on our core brands: SmartStyle, Supercuts, Signature Style and Premium | Mall Brands. This will enable our field leaders to focus on specific brands. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we 
5

focused on managing variable stylist staffing in our corporate salons to improve financial results and executed a price increase across our company-owned salons to grow revenues. 
We continue to evaluate our investments and disinvest in non-value generating programs while investing in other value generating initiatives. As an example, we repurposed certain corporate programs and have invested in our creative digital capabilities to re-position Regis as the leading operator of value brands and technical education. Furthermore, we have launched a national SmartStyle digital advertising campaign to drive traffic to our SmartStyle locations in Walmart Supercenters and leverage our relationship with Walmart. We will continue this evaluation as we make decisions in the business.
As part of this evaluation of investments, the Company announced its review of strategic alternatives for the company-owned mall locations and divested its ownership interest in MyStyle. 

At the same time, we are making thoughtful decisions to accelerate the growth of our franchise business, including the promotion of Eric Bakken to President of our Franchise business. This strategic initiative is intended to facilitate an ongoing multi-year transformation of our operating platform that balances our commitment to high-performing company-owned salons while enabling strategic optionality and the ongoing growth of our franchise business.
Guests
Among other factors, consistent delivery of an exceptional guest experience, haircut quality, convenience, competitive pricing, salon location, inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, differentiating benefits and guest experience elements and comprehensive retail assortments, all drive guest traffic and improve guest retention.
Guest Experience.    Our portfolio of salon concepts enable our guests to select different service scheduling options based upon their preference. We believe that in the value category, the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times is an essential element in delivering an efficient guest experience. Our mobile app and online check-in for Supercuts and SmartStyle allows us to capitalize on our guests' desire for convenience. We continue to focus on stylist staffing and retention, optimizing schedules and leveraging our POS systems to help us balance variable labor hours with guest traffic and manage guest wait times. In the Premium category, our salons generally schedule appointments in advance of service. Our salons are located in high-traffic strip centers, Walmart Supercenters and shopping malls, with guest parking and easy access, and are generally open seven days per week, offering guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs. 
Affordability.    The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect outstanding service at competitive prices. These expectations are met with average service transactions ranging from $18 to $22. In the premium category, our guests expect upscale, full service beauty services at reasonable prices. Average service transactions approximate $49 in this category. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon level basis and established based on local conditions.
Salon Appearance and Atmosphere.    The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square feet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet. Our salon repairs and maintenance program is designed to ensure we invest in salon cleanliness and safety, as well as in maintaining the normal operation of our salons. Our annual capital expenditures include funds to refresh the appeal and comfort of our salons. 
Retail Assortments.    The Company's salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as a complete assortment of owned brand products. The Company's stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests. Additionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of our guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include Regis designLINE, Paul Mitchell, Biolage, Redken, Sexy Hair Concepts, Nioxin, Kenra, It's a 10, Total Results, and Tigi.
Technology.    Our point of sale (POS) systems have the ability to collect guest and transactional data and enable the Company to invest in guest relationship management, gaining insights into guest behavior, communicating with guests and incenting return visits. Leveraging this technology allows us to monitor guest retention and to survey our guests for feedback on improving the guest experience. Our mobile apps, including the recently launched SmartStyle mobile app, allow guests to view wait times and interact in other ways with salons. We are currently making further investments to improve the speed of our POS technology, improving the overall guest experience.
Marketing.    We are investing in advertising to drive traffic. This includes leveraging advertising and media, guest relationship management programs, digital programs, one-on-one communications and local tactical efforts (e.g., couponing), among other programs.  Traffic driving efforts are targeted vs. a one-size-fits-all approach. Annual advertising and promotional 
6

plans are based on seasonality, consumer mindset, competitive positioning and return on investment. We continually reallocate marketing investments into opportunities we believe represent the highest return to our shareholders.
Stylists
Our organization depends on its stylists to help deliver great guest experiences.
Field Leadership. As of August 1, 2017, we reorganized our field leadership by brand. This change will simplify and better focus our business by re-aligning the existing field leaders into four distinct field organizations: SmartStyle, Supercuts, Signature Style, and Premium | Mall Brands. Previously, these field leaders were responsible for a variety of brands, with different business models, services, pay plans and guest expectations. Post-reorganization, each field leader is dedicated to a specific brand. We believe the new structure will further enable our field leadership to focus on quality guest experiences, enable improved salon execution, drive same-store sales traffic growth and simplify our operations. 
Development of our field leaders is a high priority because stylists depend on their salons and field leaders for coaching, mentoring and motivation. Our training curriculum serves as the foundation for ongoing leadership development. Role clarity and talent assessments help us identify ways to develop and upgrade field leadership. Execution disciplines are used to drive accountability, execution and business performance. Incentives are designed to align field interests with those of the Company's shareholders by rewarding behaviors focused on revenue and EBITDA growth. This organization structure also provides a clear career path for our people who desire to ascend within the Company.
Technical Education. We place a tremendous amount of importance in ongoing development of our stylists' craft. We intend to be the industry leader in technical training, including the utilization of digital training. Our stylists deliver a superior experience for our guests when they are well trained technically and experientially. We employ technical trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the Company from beauty schools and training for all stylists in current beauty care and styling trends. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers who bring specialized expertise to our stylists. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate the running of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions.
 Recruiting.     Ensuring that we attract, train and retain our stylists is critical to our success. We compete with all service industries for our stylists; to that end, we continue to enhance our recruiting efforts across all levels within our organization and are focused on showing our stylists a path forward. We cultivate a pipeline of field leaders through succession planning and recruitment venues from within and outside the salon industry. We also leverage beauty school relationships and participate in job fairs and industry events.
Technology.    Our POS systems and salon workstations throughout North America enable communication with salons and stylists, delivery of online and digital training to stylists, salon level analytics on guest retention, wait times, stylist productivity, and salon performance. We are currently making further investments in our POS hardware and salon technology to improve the speed of our systems allowing for stylists to be more productive and improve overall guest and stylist satisfaction. We are also deploying tablets to salons to enhance the channel of communication with our stylists and enable digital training. 
Salon Support
Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. This acknowledges that loving our guests and stylists mandates a service-oriented, guest and stylist-focused mentality in supporting our field organization.
Organization.    Salon Support and our associated priorities are aligned to our field organization to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service we provide and optimize the guest experience. 
Simplification.   Our ongoing simplification efforts focus on improving the way we plan and execute across our portfolio of brands. Every program, communication, and report that reduces time in front of our guests is being assessed for simplification or elimination. Simplifying processes and procedures around scheduling, inventory management, day-to-day salon execution, communication and reporting improve salon service. Our organization also remains focused on identifying and driving cost savings and profit enhancing initiatives that do not harm the guest experience.

Salon Franchising Program:
General.    We have various franchising programs supporting our 2,646 franchised salons as of June 30, 2017, consisting mainly of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters, Roosters and Magicuts. These salons have been included in the discussions regarding salon counts and concepts.
We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval and lease negotiation, construction management services, professional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of on-going support designed to help franchisees build successful businesses.
Standards of Operations.    The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment, benefits and wage determination, establishing prices to charge for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established operational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design and decor, and trademark usage. The Company's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the standards for each franchising program. All of the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the Company to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control the franchise operations or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company’s franchise agreements do not give the Company any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of franchisees’ employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor, and trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees’ employees’ wages and benefits, hours of work, scheduling, leave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute resolution procedures, dress code, and/or discipline and discharge. 
Franchise Terms.    Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and ongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most franchise concepts, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and administers the funds on behalf of the concepts. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of franchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the Company's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location.
Additional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below:
Supercuts
Supercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination of the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements, which give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific. The development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements. Older franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements and provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that resolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store sites.
SmartStyle
The majority of existing SmartStyle franchise agreements have a five year term with a five year option to renew. The franchise agreements are site specific to salons located in Walmart Supercenters. As announced in January 2017, this business is growing both organically and through transfers from corporate to franchise-owned salons.
11

Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Magicuts
The majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15 year term with a 15 year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a ten year term with a five year option to renew. The majority of Magicuts franchise agreements have a term equal to the greater of five years or the current initial term of the lease agreement with an option to renew for two additional five year periods. The current franchise agreement is site specific. Franchisees may enter into development agreements with the Company which provide limited territorial protection.
Roosters Men’s Grooming Center
Roosters franchise agreements have a ten-year term with a ten-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee). New franchisees enter into a franchise agreement concurrent with the opening of their first store, along with a development agreement under which they have the right to open two additional locations. 
Franchisee Training.    The Company provides new franchisees with training, focusing on the various aspects of salon management, including operations, personnel management training, marketing fundamentals, and financial controls. Existing franchisees receive training, counseling and information from the Company on a regular basis. The Company provides salon managers and stylists with technical training for Supercuts and SmartStyle franchisees.
Salon Markets and Marketing:
Company-Owned Salons
The Company utilizes various marketing vehicles for its salons, including traditional advertising, guest relationship management, digital marketing programs and promotional/pricing based programs. A predetermined allocation of revenue is used for such programs. Most marketing vehicles including radio, print, online, digital and television advertising are developed and supervised at the Company's Salon Support headquarters. The Company reviews its brand strategy with the intent to create more clear communication platforms, identities and differentiation points for our brands to drive consumer preference.
Franchised Salons
Most franchise concepts maintain separate advertising funds that provide comprehensive marketing and sales support for each system. The Supercuts advertising fund is the Company's largest advertising fund and is administered by a council consisting of primarily franchisee representatives. The council has overall control of the advertising fund's expenditures and operates in accordance with terms of the franchise operating and other agreements. All stores, company-owned and franchised, contribute to the advertising funds, the majority of which are allocated to the contributing market for media placement and local marketing activities. The remainder is allocated for the creation of national advertising and system-wide activities.
Affiliated Ownership Interests:
The Company maintains ownership interests in beauty schools. The primary ownership interest is a 54.6% interest in Empire Education Group, Inc. (EEG), which is accounted for as an equity method investment. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. EEG operates accredited cosmetology schools. Contributing the Company's beauty schools in fiscal 2008 to EEG leveraged EEG's management expertise, while enabling the Company to maintain a vested interest in the beauty school industry. Additionally, we utilize our EEG relationship to recruit stylists straight from beauty school. 
Corporate Trademarks:
The Company holds numerous trademarks, both in the United States and in many foreign countries. The most recognized trademarks are "SmartStyle," "Supercuts," "MasterCuts," "Regis Salons," "Cost Cutters," "Hair Masters," "First Choice Haircutters," and "Magicuts."
"Sassoon" is a registered trademark of Procter & Gamble. The Company has a license agreement to use the Sassoon name for existing salons and academies and new salon development.
Corporate Employees:

Governmental Regulations:
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business as well as a variety of regulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty related business, including health and safety.

In the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (the FTC Rule) and by state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise operations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of an offering circular/disclosure document containing specified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has registered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and in which such registration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the franchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, may prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees and may limit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is for government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not expect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations.
In Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs by way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial franchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship requirements such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees.
The Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all of its operations.
The Company maintains an ownership interest in EEG. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of their revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education Act of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the school, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education.
