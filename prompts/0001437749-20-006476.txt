ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Mikros Systems Corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “Mikros” or “us”) designs and manufactures software, hardware and electronic systems used to maintain complex distributed systems. Examples of such systems include defense equipment such as radars and combat systems, and commercial and industrial applications such as printing presses, power distribution, and utility systems, and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) systems.
 
Over the past decade, our principal customer has been the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), primarily the U.S. Navy (“Navy”). We provide the following key system to the Navy for maintenance of radars and combat systems:
 

● | ADSSS®, the ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite, a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) system used to monitor Combat System Elements (CSEs) onboard the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
More recently, we have developed and marketed software products to analyze maintenance data collected from target systems, optimize maintenance procedures, and predict failures. Our Prognostics Framework® (PF) and Diagnostic Profiler® (DP) products provide software capabilities which complement our maintenance hardware products (ADEPT and ADSSS) and allow us to provide complete hardware/software solutions for advanced maintenance, particularly of complex distributed systems. Now that we have a complete hardware/software solution for advanced maintenance, we are expanding into commercial and industrial markets.
 
Our Products
 
Adaptive Diagnostic Electronic Portable Testset. ADEPT, also known as the AN/PSM-132, is an automated maintenance workstation designed to significantly reduce the time required to align all variants of the AN/SPY1 Radar System aboard U.S. Navy AEGIS cruisers and destroyers while optimizing system performance and readiness. Manufacturing, selling and servicing ADEPT units was a substantial part of our business over the past decade. During the life of the program, we delivered a total of 226 ADEPT units to our Navy customers. Effective October 1, 2019, the US Navy determined to stop funding the ADEPT program.
ADEPT Distance Support Sensor Suite. In 2013, we started development of ADSSS for the Navy’s LCS. Our system has now matured and has earned the official Navy nomenclature AN/SYM-3. The LCS is the U.S. Navy’s latest combat warship. AN/SYM-3 is a network-enabled system that can be configured to monitor multiple shipboard systems and report maintenance data onshore for further analysis to detect trends and predict failures. AN/SYM-3 provides an open architecture approach with industry-standard hardware, and cybersecurity compliant software to acquire and process system operational and maintenance data. The AN/SYM-3 system fully automates the capture of system operation, environment and maintenance data to provide unattended operation. The system monitors key parameters and sends alert notifications when parameters move out of tolerance.
 
The first full AN/SYM-3 system was successfully completed on LCS 2 and onshore installation of prognostics software has been completed at Port Hueneme Division. The ADSSS is used on both variants of the LCS, currently planned to be at least 32 ships. In 2019, we completed installations on four more LCS ships that are being deployed allowing for data collection while operational at sea. During 2020, we expect to install systems on two or three additional ships. We are working with the government to have their virtual data transport system installed on two deploying ships, allowing for near real-time data to be sent back to shore and processed through our prognostics framework models.  During 2020, we expect to add four new combat system elements to our LCS platform which is expected to expand our footprint and bring condition-based maintenance plus (CBM +) to additional mission-critical systems.
 
Through our NSSMS contract awarded in the fourth quarter of 2019, we plan to develop a new variant of the AN/SYM-3 system for the NATO Seasparrow Surface Missile System.  NSSMS is installed on Navy Aircraft Carriers (CVN class) and “Big Deck” Amphibious Assault Ships (LHD/LHA class), so the new variant could be installed on these two new ship classes. We have started the software, hardware, and systems engineering tasks needed to move this CBM capability to land based test events and then to a long-term pilot installation for four systems on the NSSMS platform.
 
The SYM-3 has also generated interest from other ship classes, Aegis and unmanned systems, and for use to monitor shipboard hull, mechanical and electrical (HME) systems, additional combat systems, and navigational radars.  This is part of the Navy’s continued effort to increase operational, sustainability and lethality for many different ship classes.

Diagnostic Profiler. The Diagnostic Profiler is an integrated development environment for developing diagnostic capabilities used in maintenance, embedded diagnostics, and troubleshooting applications. The software provides diagnostic services to its host application, including fault callouts, suggested “next best” test to further isolate faults, and direct maintenance actions. When additional faults are identified, the software prioritizes the fault callouts by probability. The use of the Diagnostic Profiler eliminates the need for the development and maintenance of diagnostic flow charts and hard-coded text sequences. This reduces the effort required to correct bugs and design changes. Over the life of the system, this could result in significant cost savings. This system is used by clients and has also generated yearly support contracts for service. Mikros has also been upgrading and customizing the system to the client needs. 
Prognostics Framework. Prognostics Framework is an analytic software framework for implementing real-time prognostics, diagnostics, and status monitoring to support embedded prognostic applications, health management systems and condition-based maintenance applications. The Prognostics Framework software institutes an information framework that organizes relevant data related to: (i) the condition of the system; (ii) the system’s ability to perform required functions over specific time intervals; and (iii) the need for maintenance actions and repair parts. The Prognostics Framework has been used to implement a complete health management system on one of the first radar systems to require prognostics as a key element of its overall solutions. Other potential applications include complex computer networks, power generators, power supply, cooling, C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence), environmental and imaging systems.
Government Contracts 
 
In September 2016, we were awarded and entered into a multi-year IDIQ contract with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division, relating to our ADSSS product. The contract has a term of five years and provides for the purchase and sale of up to $48 million of ADSSS units and related engineering and logistics support. The first delivery order in the amount of $3.0 million was awarded on September 15, 2016 to perform installations, support and logistics for the LCS class.
 
In June 2018, we received the second delivery order under our multi-year IDIQ relating to our ADSSS product. This $2.5 million order provides for further MK 99 Fire Control System (FCS) development, test and installation.
 
In September 2019, we received the third delivery order under our multi-year IDIQ relating to our ADSSS product. The award covers the installation of condition-based maintenance systems for the Littoral Combat Ship and has a ceiling of $15 million.  As of the date of this report, approximately $1.0 million of incremental funding has been awarded for work to be executed in government fiscal year (FY) 2020. 
 
In October 2019, we received an additional contract award under our multi-year IDIQ relating to our ADSSS product. This incremental funding with a ceiling up to $6 million, under the third delivery order, covers the development of a new variant of the AN/SYM-3 system and installation of the new CBM system on two additional ship classes; the Aircraft Carriers (CVN class) and the “Big Deck” Amphibious Assault Ships (LHD/LHA class). As of the date of this report, $1.0 million of incremental funding has been awarded for work to be executed in FY 2020 and we expect an additional award in the amount of $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2020.  
 
In April 2017, we received contract awards totaling $2.0 million from the U.S. Navy to extend the capabilities of the ADSSS Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) system to support a fourth Navy radar system, the MK 99. The Small Business Innovation Research office in Dahlgren, VA provided $0.5 million of the total funding to support this effort.
 
In February 2017, we were awarded a follow-on multi-year Small Business Innovation Research Phase III IDIQ contract with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, for our ADEPT program. The contract provided for the purchase and sale of up to $35.1 million of ADEPT units and related engineering, such as calibration, repair, training and other logistics services. We have been awarded several delivery orders under the ADEPT IDIQ Contract. In October 2019, we received notice from Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems that the ADEPT program will not be funded in fiscal year 2020. We will continue to fulfill our current obligations under outstanding engineering services task orders previously issued under the program. As of the date of this report, we have one open task order for general engineering services.
 
In November 2019, we were awarded a five (5) year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) from Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, to begin a Phase I SBIR effort entitled “Unmanned Surface Vehicle and Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Autonomous Behavior Development”. The amount of this Phase I effort was approximately $150,000.
 
Small Business Innovation Research Grants
 
We have been an active participant in the DoD’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant program which has resulted in the award of numerous prime government contracts including the multi-year IDIQ contracts upon which we have built our business in recent years. We have renewed our bid and proposal efforts to pursue projects that fall within our areas of expertise. These areas include electronic systems engineering and integration, radar systems engineering, combat/C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence) systems engineering, communications engineering, remote monitoring, and augmented reality. In that regard, in 2019, we generated one Phase I award for sensor signal processing on a Navy unmanned vehicle platform.

Commercial Contracts
 
In 2019 and 2020, HP Indigo, Saab Grintek Defense and Northrop Grumman renewed their annual contracts for Diagnostic Profiler and Diagnostician Software Maintenance and Support.  We have also increased our capabilities to provide online support at one of the client’s facility. 
Manufacturing and Depot Center
 
We operate a Manufacturing and Depot Center in Largo, Florida which has been manufacturing our AN/PSM-132 and AN/SYM-3 systems for our DoD customers since 2010. Our center is American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ISO 9001:2015 certified for manufacturing, distribution and support of electronic systems for military and commercial applications and products. The facility is supported by our Research and Development center in Fort Washington, PA which is ISO 9001:2015 certified for design and development of electronic systems for military and commercial applications and products. Our quality management system complies with Naval Sea Systems Command Standard Item 009-04. In addition to facility certifications, we have personnel trained and certified in numerous IPC – Association Connecting Electronics Industries, Lean Six Sigma (LSS), and Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) specialties. We offer light manufacturing, integration, kitting, build-to-print, and box-build with testing services to commercial customers and DoD contractors. Expanding the Largo facility’s light manufacturing and integration services for commercial customers and other DoD contractors is a key component of our long-term growth strategy. At this time, we are  producing AN/SYM-3 kits that will be used for different combat systems for our planned Navy ship installs for both LCS and NSSMS.  We are also starting the manufacturing effort for CBM + opportunities for commercial clients that will utilize our Mikros MindR® data collection system, our commercial version of our PF solution, which is more affordable, light weight, and easily installed in different customer environments.
Corporate Growth & Strategy
 
Our strategy for continued growth is based on continuing expansion of our defense business and executing new initiatives to apply our advanced maintenance technology in commercial markets. Regarding the defense industry, we expect to continue expanding our technology base, backlog and revenue by continuing to bid on projects that fall within our areas of expertise. These areas include electronic systems engineering and integration, radar systems engineering, combat/C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Intelligence) systems engineering, communications engineering, remote monitoring, and augmented reality. We believe that we can utilize the intellectual property developed under our various SBIR awards to develop proprietary products, such as ADEPT and ADSSS, with broad appeal in both the government and commercial marketplace. Our state-of-the-art test equipment can be used by many commercial and governmental customers such as the FAA, radio and television stations, cell phone stations, and airlines. Second, we will continue to actively participate in the SBIR program and pursue SBIR projects with the DoD, Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies. Third, we believe that through our marketing of products, such as AN/SYM 3 (ADSSS), we will develop key relationships with prime defense contractors. Our strategy is to develop these relationships into long-term, key subcontractor roles on future major defense programs awarded to these prime contractors.
 
Regarding commercial markets, our Diagnostics Profiler and Prognostics Framework software offerings complement our hardware products and allow us to provide complete hardware/software solutions for advanced maintenance applications. Current customers for these systems include major multinational corporations such as HP Indigo, which recently extended our Diagnostic Profiler software support for a seventh year. We continue to receive repeat orders from these customers to support their applications. We plan to provide “condition-based maintenance” systems for “complex distributed systems” to commercial customers. In that regard, we are currently developing a condition-based maintenance solution for industrial equipment based on our proprietary Prognostics Framework solution, which we call Mikros MindR®. We have deployed two active pilot systems that are providing key maintenance data daily to service technicians. We are also in discussion with additional commercial companies regarding the use of our condition-based maintenance applications.
 
In 2020, our primary strategic focus is to continue as a premium provider of R&D and product development services to the defense industry, generate multiple task orders under our IDIQ and BOA contracts, additional Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants with a view to obtaining additional government contracts, and, expand our commercial business through marketing and sales of our Prognostics Framework and Diagnostic Profiler software products. In furtherance of this strategy, we will also seek to generate incremental revenue through providing light assembly and production services to commercial customers at our M&D Center in Largo, Florida.
 
Over the longer term, we intend to further develop advanced maintenance technologies and implement these technologies in products for deployment in defense applications and to expand into more commercial applications. We believe that many of our core capabilities, remote monitoring, rugged systems, predictive maintenance and communications expertise, are applicable to other industries that work with complex distributed systems, such as utilities, communications and transportation systems. We are currently in discussions with certain industry participants regarding this initiative.
 
During recent years, the combination of spending caps, discretionary spending cuts, sequestration and reductions in defense spending has caused, and may in the future continue to cause, delays in funding certain projects. This may negatively impact our revenues and profits.

Competition
 
The SBIR arena is highly competitive and we compete against numerous small businesses for SBIR awards. In our general business area of electronic defense systems and products, we also compete against many larger companies that have greater financial and human resources. We believe that the primary competitive factors in obtaining SBIR contracts are technical expertise, prior relevant experience, and cost. We believe that our history of completing projects in a timely and efficient manner, along with the experience of our management and technical personnel, enables us to compete effectively for SBIR grants.
Intellectual Property
 
Under SBIR data rights, we are protected from unauthorized use of SBIR-developed technology and data for a period of five years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under a particular SBIR contract or any follow-on contract.
Customer Concentration and Dependence on Federal Government
 
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from SBIR and IDIQ contracts with the U.S. Federal government. In 2019, approximately 99% of our revenues were realized in connection with government contracts. In 2018, approximately 98% of our revenues were realized in connection with government contracts. Although our operations are not subject to any particular government approval or regulations, we are dependent upon funding being made available to the DoD in amounts sufficient to cover the SBIR grants and other DoD contracts for which we compete.
Research and Development
 
We specialize in the development of electronic systems technology for military and commercial applications. All our research and development costs in 2019 and 2018 were for the benefit of our customers, who are agencies of the federal government. The customer-sponsored research and development projects are performed under contracts and are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed. In future periods, we may engage in company-sponsored research and development projects which would be expensed as incurred.
 
In 2019, we continued to devote substantial resources to expanding our technical expertise and strengthening our research and development capabilities. These efforts included hiring additional engineering professionals, implementing policies and procedures required to earn and maintain important certifications, including ISO 9001:2015 quality certifications and Naval Sea Systems Quality Standard 009-004. We believe these investments will continue to make us more competitive and generate new opportunities in both government and commercial markets.
 
Backlog
 
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists primarily of ADSSS systems to be developed and delivered together with related engineering and logistics support. At December 31, 2019, our backlog was $1.8 million.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 26 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees of which 21 work at our Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, Research & Development Center, 1 works at our Princeton, New Jersey corporate headquarters, 1 works at our Washington, DC office, and 5 work at our Largo, Florida M&D Center. None of our employees belong to a labor union. We believe relations with our employees are good. We also use the services of subcontractors and consultants as necessary to aid in software and hardware development and for the manufacture of products.
