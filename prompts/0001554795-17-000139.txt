ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
We were formed to monetize the experience of our founders in generating traffic through the front doors of hearing aid dispensing practices by providing advertising and marketing and design services that are unique to the industry. We also provide consulting services including store set-up, customer relations management and sales techniques, all to take advantage of the customers acquired in the course of the advertising and marketing campaigns. We have created the “Alliance” program, enabling independent hearing aid practitioners to leverage their collective purchasing power of hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases. We plan to become a leader in auditory rehab training utilizing our interactive computer-based software program called Aware™, a self-assessment and training module that helps individuals work through simple to difficult auditory skills. We are dedicated to serving the retail hearing aid dispensing community and developing a program to contribute to various hearing aid focused charities.
 
Whether the hearing aid dispensary is small, medium or large, we have previously shown an ability to increase the total revenue of our clients without increasing cost. There are over 14,000 retail hearing aid dispensing practices in the United States. The company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums, along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences, especially the 55+ age sector which is our clients’ primary targeted audience. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to marketing service providers for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures.
 
The Alliance program will enable independent hearing aid practitioners to leverage the purchasing power of the hearing devices by grouping together and aggregating their purchases. The potential savings to an individual of the Alliance may be significant and may increase their operating margin.

Additionally, individual Alliance members can also utilize our expertise in marketing and advertising to potentially increase each member’s units sold per month. We use geographically and demographically targeted Direct Mail campaigns as well as print advertising in local newspapers during a promotional event. The goal is for Alliance members to work with us in creating an exclusive and time-sensitive promotion for buying devices without the consumer researching their local market for the same product at a cheaper price, a common problem for the industry and individual businesses. Oftentimes, the consumer researches the same product and compares prices with other local hearing device retailers on the internet and purchases the hearing device with the cheapest, but not always the best hearing aid retailer. The Company anticipates that this approach, combined with the Alliance, may increase the efficiency of the promotion.
 
We provide a comprehensive range of services (including consulting services), grouped into four fundamental disciplines: advertising/marketing, customer relationship management, public relations and specialty communications.
 

• | Advertising/marketing: We design and implement all the advertising and marketing activities for the client, generally to the general population in their market to the pre-determined demographic. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer relationship management (CRM): We work with our clients to help identify and market to the their customer database, using automatic triggers to market to them on certain anniversaries for the customer, for example, initial purchase date, hearing device warranty expiration, birthday, etc... 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public relations: We work with local and national press release companies to help the client write and publish press releases, as well as with the client to determine and execute certain actives to yield a long term positive outcome for the business, using community outreach and other activities to help build the clients brand. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialty communications: The world is no longer one big place where mass communications and marketing define the methods of communications. Our society is now a collection of audiences defined by different cultures, ethnicities, genders, lifestyles and interests. We excel in specialty communications by reaching each intended audience with communication styles and vehicles germane to the targeted audience.

Corporate Overview
 
InnerScope Advertising Agency, Inc. (“InnerScope”) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated on June 15, 2012, with its principal place of business in Roseville, California. InnerScope was formed to provide advertising and marketing services to retail establishments in the hearing device industry.
 
On June 20, 2012, Innerscope acquired InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC. Through this Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC (“ILLC”), a commonly owned entity, InnerScope acquired a 100% interest of all membership interests in ILLC. On November 1, 2013, InnerScope entered into an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with Intela-Hear, LLC (“Intela-Hear”), a commonly owned entity, whereby InnerScope acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Intela-Hear. InnerScope (herein after referring to InnerScope, ILLC and Intela-Hear or “the Company”) was formed to fill the gap in the advertising/marketing side of the hearing device industry. Both ILLC and Intela-Hear were controlled and majority owned by our Chairman.
 
On October 28, 2016, a majority of the Company’s shareholders, based on the recommendation of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “BOD”), approved a forward split of the common stock, whereby an additional two shares of common stock were issued for every share of common stock outstanding (the “Forward Split”).

InnerScope is an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
 
Innerscope will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering under this prospectus, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”).
 
InnerScope also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
 Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 225,000,000 shares of common stock, and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our common stock is listed on The OTCQB under the symbol “INND.”
 Our principal corporate headquarters are located at 2281 Lava Ridge Court, Suite 130, Roseville, CA. 95661. Our telephone number is (916) 218-4100. Our website address is www.innerscopeadagency.com.

Customers
 
Moore Family Hearing Company (“MFHC”), a related party, controlled by our Chairman, pursuant to a Marketing Agreement (the “MFHC Marketing Agreement”), accounted for approximately 48% and 83% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On August 5, 2016, MFHC and the Company agreed to cancel the MFHC Marketing Agreement as a result of the sale by MFHC of substantially all of their assets, including the hearing aid dispensaries to which we were providing services. Prior to the sale, MFHC stores increased from 18 as of January 1, 2015 to 20 as August 5, 2016. We charged MHFC $3,200 per store per month effective January 1, 2015. Beginning April 1, 2016, through August 5, 2016, the Company also provided direct print and mail advertising services to MFHC. For the year ended December 31, 2016, one unrelated customer accounted for approximately 52% of our revenues.
 
On August 5, 2016, the Company along with Mark Moore (“Mark”, the Company’s chairman), Matthew Moore (“Matthew”, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer) and Kim Moore (“Kim”, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer) entered into a Store Expansion Consulting Agreement (the “Expansion Agreement”) with an unrelated party. Mark, Matthew and Kim are herein referred to collectively as the Moores. Pursuant to the Expansion Agreement, the Company and the Moores will be responsible for all physical plant and marketing details for new store openings during the initial term of six-months. The Expansion Agreement was cancelled on January 6, 2017. The Company’s client has decided to do their own marketing in-house and eliminate this out-sourced contract, and has decided to delay the opening of any new stores.  The Company has recognized a gain on the cancellation of the Expansion Agreement of $64,000 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The client has agreed to pay the Store Expansion earn out fee and an additional $30,000 for the cancellation of the Marketing Agreement and Store Expansion Agreement.

Also on August 5, 2016, the Company and the Moores entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with the same unrelated party as the store Expansion Agreement. Under the Consulting Agreement, including a Non-Compete provision covering a ten mile radius of any retail store, the Company and the Moores will provide unlimited licensing of the Intela-Hear brand name, exclusive access to the Aware Aural Rehab Program within 10 miles of retail stores, exclusive territory of all services within 10 miles of retail stores and 40 hours per month of various consulting services. The Consulting Agreement continues until January 31, 2019, unless terminated for cause, as defined in the Consulting Agreement. The Company recognized $402,777 of revenue from the Consulting Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company will realize $1,000,000 of the revenues under the Agreement in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.
 
Effective August 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Marketing Agreement (the “Marketing Agreement”) with the same unrelated party as the Consulting and Store Expansion Agreement. Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement, the Company will provide marketing concepts and designs to promote its products and use the Company’s advertising services for an initial six month period. Pursuant to the Marketing Agreement and the current structure, the Company will receive $50,000 per month. On January 6, 2017, the Marketing Agreement was cancelled. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized $193,548 of revenue from the Marketing Agreement. 
 
We typically focus on the medium size hearing aid providers and practices (4 to 20 locations) to large hearing aid 20+ dispensing practice locations where the advantages of strategic, cost-effective advertising are appreciated, but practice ownership cannot afford or have the time or expertise in-house to create and maintain these programs. The Company is currently marketing its services to potential new clients.
 
Revenue Generation
 
We derive our revenue from:
 

• | Monthly Consulting Fees, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design Services/Licensing Fees, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Media Buying 
--+------------------------------------------------------

Consulting Fees
 
We create relationships with our clients for monthly consulting fees. This fee gives the client access to copyrighted materials in our library. The fee also gives the client preferred buying status in the media-buying program, which includes direct mailings, television and radio advertisements, and email advertisements. This allows the client to realize substantial savings through our relationships. Management believes this saved money is typically invested back into the marketing expenditure of the client, which increases our revenue and profits. Fees are based on the practice size (number of locations) in conjunction with an estimated number of consulting and design hours expected to be utilized by the client.
Design Services & Licensing Fees
 
We are a full design studio that designs individual Business to Customer (B2C) marketing pieces specialized for the hearing device industry. We also design and implement website creations from concept to implementation.
Media Buying
 
We negotiate, on behalf of the client, to get the best possible rates while receiving a commission from the media outlet. As part of our media buying, we utilize television advertisements, radio advertisements, email campaigns, and direct mail marketing.
 The most profitable of these media-buying sectors is direct mail marketing where we contract with mail production houses as needed. This allows us to produce the highest quality materials at a competitive price with minimum quantities required, which is a key competitive edge for us and our clients. Our management believes that when the client saves money, they typically reinvest back into their marketing budget for further marketing expenditures.

Marketing and Business Development
 
We market our advertising services through three different marketing programs: Direct Relationships, Customer Referrals and Direct Sales and Marketing.
 
Direct Relationships
 
Our business primarily comes from referrals from industry consultants and hearing aid manufacturers. Industry consultants and hearing aid manufacturers refer their customers (hearing practices) to us to help the hearing practice with their marketing services including practice consultation, direct mail, newspaper advertisements, media buying and telemarketing services.
Referrals
 
We continue to develop a self-referral network between current and past clients that uses current and time-tested successful marketing campaigns and marketing consulting services.
 
Direct Sales and Marketing
 
We have a complete database of all hearing aid practices across the country, totaling over 15,000 independent businesses. We target these practices through telemarketing, direct mail, and email marketing to contact the practice owners and managers to consider us as their marketing arm.
 
We provides incentives to new customers by providing a low cost direct mail program, which would be on average 30% less in cost then the competition but still maintaining a profit. This marketing offer creates goodwill and proves to the customer that they can be profitable and successful using our services.
 
THE FUTURE 
 
The Alliance Plan
 
The Company is in the midst of setting up an Alliance (the “Alliance”), which will provide for hearing aid practices to purchase products offered by the Alliance at a discount through a contract already negotiated by the Company with a manufacturer. The Alliance will set up members (at no additional cost) in all large and medium sized markets around the United States to sell private label hearing devices that are manufactured and shipped by a leading manufacturer. Through the Alliance, the member will be able to purchase product directly from the manufacturer at a discount. The manufacturer will be billing and collecting for all hearing aids sold to the member under the pricing arrangement agreed to by the member and the Alliance. The manufacturer and the Alliance, on a monthly basis, will calculate the difference between the member price and the Alliance price (the “rebate”). The manufacturer will then pay the rebate to the Company on a monthly basis. The Company will recognize the rebate as revenue in the month the rebate is earned. The manufacturer will not charge any fees associated with the collecting or distribution of the margin between the member’s price and the Alliance’s price.
Marketing Support
 
A significant benefit for the Alliance members will be marketing support. We will be the marketing arm for the Alliance and all members will have access to the lowest cost of direct mail marketing in the industry and time-tested marketing materials for direct mail and newspaper advertisements. This benefit could increase an Alliance member’s practice to new levels or help the Alliance become more efficient and cost effective business.
 The Alliance will be creating a Business Development Fund (BDF) for every Alliance member created from their monthly hearing device purchases from the Alliance group. The Alliance will contribute 5% of the monthly total or net paid for hearing instruments purchased through the member’s Alliance account every month and deposited into a BDF to be used or credited toward that member’s future marketing/advertising.

-

By agreeing to become a part of The Alliance, the Alliance Member will gain exclusive access to the Alliance offerings in a particular geographic area, with a guarantee from the Company that it will not permit any other hearing aid practice in that geographic area to join the Alliance. This insures that no competitors in the member’s market area has the right to sell or use:
 
The Alliance’s
private label brand hearing instruments
The Alliance’s
proprietary programming software (only authorized Alliance businesses can program the hearing instruments)
Any marketing,
advertising, or price strategies (exclusive to only Alliance businesses)


The Company’s arrangement with the manufacturer will allow each practice to decide whether a private label strategy (using an Alliance brand) is right for their practice, or if a combination of both the manufacturer’s label and private label hearing instruments may be the right choice. The Alliance will offer both choices with the same discount levels. Unless a retailer is a member of the Alliance, the discount of purchasing either an Alliance branded device or the manufacturer’s hearing device will not be available.
 The Alliance will use high value packaging and collateral materials. All of the hearing instruments will be delivered to the patient in a branded and zippered fabric case, which includes a drying cup, cleaning spray, ear gel, cleaning wipes, and brush/pick magnet combo with a vent brush. All of the Alliance’s high quality hearing instruments will be fully supported with quality customer brochures, as well as a consumer based website, www.intelahear.com.
 Alliance Marketing Plan
 
The Alliance marketing plan is divided into distinct phases.
 
1st phase: The Alliance will focus on a grass roots campaign through word of mouth with industry leaders, which have private practice contacts that are currently searching for a group to help them navigate through these challenging times.
 
2nd phase: Using social media such as LinkedIn, the Alliance will make connections with the decision makers of private practices that are not currently tied into a single manufacturer or a supply arrangement with a hearing device manufacturer.
 
3rd phase: Recruit outside manufacturer representatives that are already located in the geographic territories where the Alliance desires to expand. These outside manufacturer representatives would have local knowledge and resources to find and convert existing practices to the Alliance.
  
The Alliance will primarily offer 2 levels for the Alliance members, and 1 additional, exclusive tier in the network.
 
The first level
will offer the Alliance member a 35% discount off the single unit price from the manufacturer if they purchase less than 20 units
per month through the alliance. These units could be a private label or the manufacturer’s labeled hearing device. All units
except the entry-level hearing device would qualify for a 5% Business Development Fund (hereinafter “BDF”) contribution.
This BDF will be calculated on the Alliance accounting side at the end of each month. The Alliance will then produce a statement
to the Alliance member. The Alliance will be fully responsible for reimbursing the BDF to the Alliance members.
The second level
will offer the Alliance member a 40% discount if they purchase more than 20 units per month through the Alliance, plus the 5%
BDF on all units except for the Entry Level Hearing Devices.
The exclusive
tier will be called the “Founders.” This super exclusive tier will be for the elite few businesses that can produce
over 100 units per month for the Alliance. The Founders tier will receive a 45% discount, plus the 5% BDF on all units except
for the Entry Level Hearing Devices. All Founders will sign a confidentially and non-disclosure agreements about their practice
being in the founders tier.

Competition
 
We have numerous direct, indirect and partial competitors, many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to provide services that will be competitive in the marketplace, and even if competitive, that we will be able to earn a profit.
 
The numerous types of direct or indirect competitors that exist in the market today include, but may not be limited to, sales and marketing firms, marketing consultants, design services, ad agencies, media buying firms, Internet marketing firms, online social media firms and others: Key competitors include Chicago Advertising & Marketing (CAM), a leader in direct marketing for the Hearing Aid Industry since 1995, Beeman Marketing, a marketing firm specializing in hearing care practitioners and audiologists since 2004, and Nutshell Marketing, a high quality direct response marketing firm specialized in targeting 55 and older age group.
 
The Alliance faces competition from major retail distributors and/or networks, as there is presently rapid growth of manufacturer-owned retail stores. Major consolidation has taken place in the US market by the hearing aid manufacturers in the last few years, with almost every manufacturer participating in buying out other smaller manufacturers, resulting in many different brand labels controlled under the same parent company umbrella. This consolidation has allowed the manufacturers to increase and control more of their distribution by offering different levels in their product lines throughout their different brands. This has also allowed the manufacturers to implement different price strategies for the same technology throughout their brands. This consolidation has not only increased their market share but also increased their profit margins.
 
The Internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids in the U.S. Numerous small companies are on the Internet advertising hearing aids for the cheapest price, and the largest hearing aid manufacturer, Sonova, which owns HearingPlanet, is most prominent among these online offerings. However, Internet sales still require the participation of a local practitioner for testing and fitting. This limits the widespread geographic appeal of Internet sales.
 
Technology and Development
 
We are equipped with three (3) G5 MacPros and one (1) iMac, which are up-to-date with the latest in software package from Adobe Creative Cloud and other graphic design software. We also utilize a large format printer and a production color printer to handle all proofing needs. All design and client information is held on a cloud computing network, which allows all designers and customer relation associates to access all design and customer files from on-site and off-site, to improve productivity and decrease lag time. Files are encrypted and password protected to make sure files are securely stored.
Intellectual Property
 
We have copyrights on all materials that are created or modified by any designers, which includes all conceptual and final artwork. Over the years, we have developed proprietary processes in how we manage our marketing programs; these processes are not protected by any patents but are covered by non-disclosure agreements executed with clients, consultants and employees. In the future we may utilize the services of contract developers, consultants, and/or third party personnel. Our success may depend in part upon our ability to preserve our trade secrets, obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, and operate without infringing upon the proprietary right of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies, trade secrets, and know-how that are not patentable. Although we may take action to protect our unpatented trade secrets and our proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors, we cannot guarantee that:

(a) | these agreements will not be breached; 
----+-------------------------------------------


(b) | we would have adequate remedies for any breach; or 
----+-------------------------------------------------------


(c) | our proprietary trade secrets and know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed or discovered by competitors. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We cannot guarantee that our actions will be sufficient to prevent imitation or duplication of either our products or services by others or prevent others from claiming violations of their trade secrets and proprietary rights.

Government Regulation.
 
We are subject to a limited variety of local, state, and federal regulations. While we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that from time to time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulation applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Our current business requires that we comply with state corporate filings, city or county business license and the necessary business liability insurance. The requirements of these regulations are minimal and do not cause any undue burden.
 
Internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the United States. Changes in the laws and regulations relating to the telecommunications and media industry, however, could impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission could begin to regulate the Internet and online service industry, which could result in increased costs for us. The laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and to our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business. There are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted, covering issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Such legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the Internet, decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, or require us to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we have 5 employees.
