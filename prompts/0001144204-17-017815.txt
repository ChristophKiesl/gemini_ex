Products
 
Action Sports Cameras
 
Our Action Sports Cameras. We believe that to succeed in the competitive action camera marketplace, it is imperative that we to distinguish our product offerings through clear and unique value propositions. For this reason, we have positioned our current action sports camera offerings as “ready-to-go” cameras. We believe our approach is unique to this category as we intend to provide a completely “all included” solution for the consumer. The strategy provides the end user with everything necessary to start enjoying the product straight out of the box. The “all included” package contains numerous universal mounts designed to enable users to capture content when engaged in a wide variety of activities. These include helmet, handlebar grip and tripod mounts. Also included are helmet straps, a tripod and a removable replaceable battery. We also sell accessories to further expand the features, versatility and convenience of our camera.
1080p Action Sports Camera.  We introduced our initial entry into the action sports camera market in November 2015. Our 1080p action camera is easy handling with sharing options that ensure high-quality images, long battery life and expandable memory storage. The camera comes in a small, easy-to-use form factor housing with dimensions of 2 5/16” W by 1¾” H, weighing 2.5 pounds with the battery installed and featuring a 2” LCD display and a 32GB Sport Series SDXC Card. The 1080p camera is a fixed-lens camera with a 5 mega-pixel sensor, a 140 degree viewing angle, and provides video recording at 1080 pixels at 30 frames per second and 12 mega pixel photos. This camera can be used in time lapse mode and is wi-fi enabled. The camera is contained in a removable polycarbonate floating water proof housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 100 feet. Our 1080p camera features a quick-release buckle and threads at the bottom to attach to all our offered mounts. In addition, we have priced our 1080p camera on an “all included basis” at $99.99, which we believe makes it extremely price competitive with other entries in the action camera market. This camera is currently offered under the name “Villain” in the United States, Monster Vision 1080p in the EU and will be sold only as Monster Vision 1080p when our current packaged inventory sells through. For information concerning certain patent infringement claims surrounding our 1080p action sports camera, see “— Litigation.”

The headset offers integrated high performance with on-ear headphones. The headset features pupil distance adjustment, precision polished glass lenses for a better picture and call answer, pause/play and multifunction control. We offer our headset at $40.
 
Data Storage Devices
 
Our primary end markets for our memory storage products are as follows:
 
Consumer.  We provide flash memory storage products to multiple consumer markets, including imaging, gaming, audio/video and mobile applications. Flash storage cards are used as the film for all major brands of digital cameras. In addition, many portable game devices include advanced features that require high capacity memory storage. Also, multimedia features and download applications in mobile phones drive demand for additional flash memory storage.
Computing.  We provide data storage solutions for the computing market. CF and SD card and USB flash drive flash memory allows consumers to store pictures and music on cards and then quickly and easily transfer these files to and between laptops, notebooks, desktops, and other devices. In addition, we sell SSDs for the computing market. We plan to continue to develop new releases of our SSDs for the notebook and desktop computer markets as we believe that SSDs are increasingly likely to replace HDDs in a variety of computing solutions.

Monster Apple iPhone/iPad External Memory Drive
 
We offer a family of ultra-small mobile external memory drive products for Apple iOS devices (iPhone/iPad/iPod) under the iX32 and Memory Cable trade names.
 
We offer an iX32 flash drive which contains a memory module (16GB up to 128GB) with a Lightning connector and a USB connector. Lightning is a proprietary computer bus and power connector created by Apple Inc. and is used to connect Apple mobile devices like iPhones, iPads and iPods to host computers, external monitors, cameras, USB battery chargers and other peripherals. Through the USB port, the user can plug his/her Apple device to any computer to store data/media and take it for future use. Through the Lightning connector, the user can download data from selected Apple iOS devices onto the drive and then transfer the data to another iOS device or to a device with a USB port (such as a TV or a computer). As a result, the user creates “freed” up space on his/her Apple device by directly copying content off the device instead of having to move the content by sending it to iCloud or other remote cloud storage destinations. It is also helpful if a user wants to consume large megabyte data, such as a movie, and does not want to store that content on his/her iOS device which would further diminish the available memory. In such an instance the “movie” can be loaded onto the drive and then watched from the drive when it is plugged into the iOS device.
 
The device also allows backup of photos, contacts, documents and videos, access to Dropbox, internal App storage and is security protected with optional password/fingerprint protection. In the case of the Memory Cable, it also serves as a charging cable if needed for the iOS device.
 
On-The-Go Cloud
 
Our On-The-Go Cloud device, which we market on an exclusive basis, is an innovative multi-function wireless media access hub. This device allows a user to create a wi-fi hot spot for multiple users, share photos and videos with friends and stream movies while on the road or in the air to any wi-fi enabled device. This lightweight, smartphone-sized device is equipped with dedicated ports for SD and microSD cards up to 64GB, as well as standard-size USB flash drives or external hard drives up to 2TB. A Micro USB cable is used for connectivity and charging the onboard battery which can last five hours on a single charge while streaming videos. When a PC or Mac is connected via the micro USB cable, it acts as a reader and hub, simultaneously giving access to memory cards and/or a storage device plugged into the USB port. Not only can data be viewed or played, it can be transferred among the connected storage. For example, an HD movie file from an SD card can be copied to an external hard drive.
 
The same functionality above can also be done wirelessly. The device has 2.4GHz (b/g/n) encrypted Wi-Fi capability, which gives cable-free connectivity to PCs, Macs, tablets and smartphones. Files can be accessed via any web browser and by wireless enumeration, in which it operates as a network drive. With a streaming capacity of up to five devices at 720p (three devices at 1080p) and unlimited direct access, it’s ideal for sharing media. The device also has an Ethernet port allowing it to act as a wi-fi hotspot. The device comes with a travel bag and micro USB cable and is priced under $100.
 
SSDs 
 
SSDs are data storage devices that utilize solid-state memory to store persistent data. SSDs contain no moving parts and use microchips that retain data in non-volatile memory chips, meaning they retain their memory when the power is turned off. SSDs have the same interface as hard disk drives (“HDDs”) and easily replace them in most applications. SSDs are used in consumer electronic products which are primarily designed for small form factor, battery powered consumer hand held devices, such as laptop computers and tablets.
 
Our drives are used for laptop, notebook, desktop and enterprise server applications. These drives feature enhanced reliability, higher performance and reduced power consumption compared to typical HHDs and are more than twice as fast as many other SSD drives.
 
Overdrive 3.0 SSD and Overdrive 3.0 Mini.  Our Overdrive 3.0 Series of SSDs is designed for consumer applications that require high-performance and endurance with easy plug and play compatibility. The drives are USB powered making them energy efficient with no external power switch required. Our Overdrive 3.0 and Overdrive 3.0 Minis are USB 2.0 compatible as well. Its robust construction is designed to survive impact up to 500g and resistant to magnetic interference and extreme temperatures. The drives have a laser extended stainless steel enclosure with a small form factor that travels easily.

The SSD includes a USB 3.0 cable and has a price point of $100.
Monster “Superfast” SSD.  Our Monster “Superfast” SSD allows a user the ability to upgrade an PC from the internal traditional rotating HDD to our MD-550 2.5” SSD. The upgrade increases the speed, battery life and reliability of the PC. The MD-550 SSD has no rotating parts thus offering substantially more reliability and durability than standard rotating HDDs.
 
Our Monster “Superfast” SSD comes in 240GB, 480GB and 1TB configurations and range in price from $150 to $450.
 
CompactFlash Cards
 
CF cards are flash memory mass storage devices used mainly in portable electronic devices. Flash memory products are electronically re-writable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. CF cards make data easy to add to a wide variety of computer devices, including digital cameras and music players, desktop computers, personal digital assistants, digital audio recorders and photo printers.
 
Our line of CF cards consists of the following:
 
800x CF. These cards are designed for discerning photo and video users. Built with a robust structure, our CF Cards feature 120 MB/s read read/write speeds and superior memory card performance.

USB Flash Drives
 
USB flash drives are small portable data storage devices that include flash memory. The integrated universal serial bus (“USB”) interface plug into a computer’s USB port and function as portable hard drives. USB flash drives have less storage capacity than an external hard drive, but they are smaller and more durable because they do not contain any internal moving parts. They are often used for storage, back-up and transfer of computer files, thus facilitating data transfers between different devices.
 
We offer a wide selection of customized USB flash drives in different memory capacities and with a wide variety of features.

Manufacturing and Product Development
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not directly manufacture any of the products we sell. Instead, we depend exclusively on third parties for the manufacture and sourcing of our products. Reliance on third party manufacturers and suppliers exposes us to material risks, especially as our action sports cameras and iX32 flash drive are currently sourced from sole source suppliers. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors — We depend exclusively on third parties to manufacture and supply our products. If third party manufacturers are unable to timely deliver required quantities of our products at acceptable qualities and prices, we will not be able to meet customer demand for our products, which would adversely impact the success of our business.” However, we believe that by outsourcing the manufacture and sourcing of these products, we benefit from lower manufacturing and engineering costs. For this reason, for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers to produce and supply the substantial majority of our products.

-

 

We do not have long-term agreements with any of our third party suppliers or manufacturers for our primary memory products or our iX32 flash drive. We currently source our current action sports camera offerings and iX32 flash drive from sole source suppliers and while we believe there is an alternative supplier available for our iX32 flash drive we do not currently have an alternative supplier for our action sports cameras. We obtain our action sports cameras further to a formal agreement with Shuoying Digital Science & Technology (China) Co., Ltd. that expires in January 2018 but automatically renews for successive 12 months periods unless sooner terminated by either party with six months prior written notice. We believe it may be more difficult to find alternative sources for our action sports cameras if necessary. We intend to endeavor to locate alternative sources for our action sports cameras to mitigate risks related to reliance on this sole source supplier.
 
We seek to differentiate our products through product features offered, product positioning, packaging, merchandising and branding. By continuing to subcontract manufacture and source our products from third parties, we believe that we are able to sell products incorporating new technology without having to make the substantial investment in, or having to incur the fixed costs associated with, product development and manufacturing.
 
Our in-house testing and production staff in Simi Valley, California regularly inspects and tests product samples, assembles pilot production runs and repackages bulk quantities received from our subcontract manufacturers and suppliers. We also develop user manuals, product packaging and marketing materials, as well as installation guides, software and hardware designed to permit user friendly product installation. Our staff periodically tours our subcontract manufacturers’ and suppliers’ facilities and monitors and tests to minimize defective products.
 
The majority of our products are shipped directly by our subcontractor manufacturers and suppliers to our facility in Simi Valley, California. These products are then packaged and shipped by us directly to our customers.
 
Product development
 
To date, we have not made material expenditures on product development. However, we realize that to compete in this industry, we must continue to offer technologically advanced products. New products are developed and offered by our subcontractors, manufacturers and suppliers and then offered by us. We believe our relationship with our contract manufacturers and suppliers allows us to enhance and expand our product offerings with existing and new technologies that such third parties develop internally and avoid the costs associated with an in-house research and development team. Our efforts are directed at the evaluation of new products and enhancements to existing products. We monitor market and industry trends to understand and identify new technologies and plan for new product offerings.
 
We intend to continue to devote efforts to introduce new products that meet emerging demands and preferences, including new versions of our existing product lines. Specifically, we plan to continue to penetrate the global action camera market, while identifying additional consumer electronic products to be introduced based on leading technologies.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales
 
We sell our products primarily through distributors and independent sales representatives and distributors.
 
Distributors.  We use distributors to sell our products to non-direct customers such as small computer manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers and other resellers. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements with us for the purchase and redistribution of our products in specific territories.
Retailers.  We sell our branded devices directly to a select group of major retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales through distributors to smaller retailers. The retail channel complements our other sales channels while helping to build brand awareness for our products. We also offer our branded products through our website.
 
Although we have established a substantial domestic distribution channel for our memory products bearing the Monster brand, we believe it is necessary to substantially expand our distribution channels with respect to sales of our higher margin specialty products. Our executive sales team has recently established domestic distribution arrangements for our actions sports cameras with major entities such as Fry’s, Sam’s Club and Toys R’ Us. We also believe that international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for us. Our executive sales team seeks to enhance our international presence by capitalizing on the strength of the Monster Digital brand. Examples of recently added international retailers and strategic distribution arrangements include Synchro France, ADL, Selfridges and FNAC.

We protect some of our customers against the effects of price decreases on their inventories. Accordingly, if we reduce our prices, we pay certain distributors and retailers the difference between the price paid for the product still in their inventory and the reduced price. Additionally, some of our retail customers and distributors have the right to return limited amounts of products still in their inventory for credit.
 
Marketing
 
We believe our marketing relationships with key industry leaders distinguishes our company from others in our industry. Our Overdrive 3.0 SSD and Overdrive Thunderbolt SSD, each with a 1TB configuration, are currently offered in all Apple stores throughout Europe. Our Advanced 3.0 OTG USB flash drive is the first Apple certified external memory of iOS. Our action sports cameras are being sold under the widely recognized Monster brand.
 
Also, our products are offered and supported by Monster, Inc.’s large global and retail distribution network. Further to the license with Monster, Inc., our company and Monster, Inc. consult and cooperate with each other in the design process of products sold under the Monster Digital brand name. Also, the license provides that our company and Monster, Inc. will cooperate to promote and effect the offer and marketing of products sold under the Monster Digital brand name through Monster, Inc.’s existing and future sales and distribution channels.
 
To date, Monster, Inc. sales team has introduced our Monster Digital memory products to many of their key distributors and retail chains and has indicated that it intends to continue to do so in the future. We believe that approximately 19% and 33% of our gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from Monster, Inc.’s introductions to buyers and retailers. Monster, Inc. has existing relationships with virtually all major retail chains and strategic distributors across North America, Latin America and Europe.
 
In addition, Monster, Inc. has a global network of independent sales representatives established which affords us the ability to access additional sales coverage and to take advantage of established local market relationships. To ensure the quality of its sales forces, our products are incorporated into Monster, Inc.’s internal sales metrics that measure sales performance for all sales people, independent sales representatives and customers.
 
We participate in co-sponsored events with our customers and industry trade shows such as Consumer Electronics Show. We participate in these events and trade shows in order to develop new relationships with potential customers and maintain relationships with our existing customers. We also intend to fund cooperative advertising campaigns with our customers, develop custom product promotions and cooperate with our retailers to use point-of-sale and mail-in rebate promotions to increase sales of our products. We also intend to utilize sales circulars to obtain regional and national exposure for our products and our brands. We believe that these marketing efforts will help generate additional shelf-space for our products with our major retailers, promote retail traffic and sales of our products, and enhance our goodwill with these retailers.

In August 2015, we executed an amendment to the license agreement with Monster whereby Monster granted us the additional right further to the aforementioned License Agreement to use the name “Monster Digital, Inc.” as our corporate name. Further to the amendment, in addition to the royalties mentioned above, we issued Monster, Inc. 382,575 shares of our common stock and paid Monster a cash fee of $500,000.
 
We are required to remit royalty payments to Monster, Inc. on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, royalty expense amounted to $371,000 and $262,000, respectively. We were not in compliance with the royalty remittance policy during each of the aforementioned fiscal periods. We were in full compliance with the remittance policy at December 31, 2016. This license agreement contains various termination clauses that include (i) change in control, (ii) breach of contract and (iii) insolvency, among others. Either party to the license agreement has the right to terminate the agreement if the other is in material breach of any of the terms and conditions of the agreement and such party fails to cure such breach within 30 days after the date of receipt of written notice from the other party.
 
In addition, in August 2015, and in connection with the aforementioned amendment to the trademark license agreement, we entered into a two-year advisory board agreement with Noel Lee, the Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder of Monster, Inc. Further to the advisory board agreement, we issued Mr. Lee a warrant to purchase up to 191,289 shares of our common stock at a per share exercise price of $14.85.
 
Warranties
 
Because the design and manufacturing process for our products is highly complex, it is possible that our products may contain defects or are otherwise not compatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of products during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions.

Backlog
 
Because of volatile conditions in our markets, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes for our products do and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly. We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Competition
 
Our industry is characterized by intense competition, supply shortages or oversupply, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence.
 
Competition is based on multitude of factors, including product design, brand strength, distribution presence and capability, channel knowledge and expertise, geographic availability, breadth of product line, product cost, media capacity, access speed and performance, durability, reliability, scalability and compatibility. Specifically, the performance, functionality, reliability and price of our products are critical elements of our ability to compete. We believe that we offer, and that our target consumers seek products that combine higher levels of performance, functionality and reliability at prices competitive with other leading brand-name products. Also, market penetration, brand recognition and inventory management are also critical elements of our ability to compete. Most consumers purchase products similar to ours from off-the-shelf retailers such as large consumer electronics and office supply superstores. Market penetration in the industries in which we compete is typically based on the number of retailers who offer a company’s products and the amount of shelf-space allocated to those products.
 
Our existing competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have longer operating histories and have greater brand name recognition, substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with retailers, distributors, OEMs and end users. As a result, these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines, ensure more stable supply, adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we may. Ultimately, this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We expect to face competition from existing or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative data storage solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features. If a manufacturer of consumer electronic devices designs one of these alternative competing standards into its products, the digital media we sell, as currently configured, will not be compatible with that product and our revenues may decline, which would result in a material adverse effect on or business.
 
Our competition includes:
 
Action sports cameras.  The market for action sports cameras is highly competitive. Further, we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors introduce new and more competitive offerings alongside their existing products, and as new market entrants introduce new products into this market. We compete against established, well-known action camera and traditional camera manufacturers such as GoPro, Inc., Canon Inc., Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation, Polaroid Holding Corporation and Vivitar Corporation, large, diversified electronics companies such as JVC Kenwood Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Corporation and Toshiba Corporation, and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd. Most of these competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. In addition, many of these existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:
 

• | longer operating histories;

• | the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;

Moreover, smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales. It is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products similar to our action sport camera. In addition to competition or potential competition from large, established companies, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products.
 
Solid-state drive and hard disk drive manufacturers.  Our SSDs face competition from other manufacturers, including Intel, Micron and Samsung, Toshiba, and others. Our SSDs also face competition from hard disks drives, which are offered by companies including, among others, Seagate, Samsung and Western Digital Corporation.
 
CF and SD card and USB flash drive manufacturers and resellers.  We compete with semiconductor companies that manufacture and sell flash memory chips, flash memory cards and USB flash drives. These include Hynix, Infineon, Micron, Samsung, SanDisk, and Toshiba. We also face significant competition from manufacturers or card assemblers and resellers that either resell flash cards and USB flash drives purchased from others or assemble cards and USB flash drives from controllers and flash memory chips purchased from companies such as Renesas, Samsung or Toshiba, into flash cards and USB flash drives. These companies include Crucial, Dane-Elec, Delkin Devices, Feiya, Fuji, Hagiwara, Hama, Hewlett Packard, Data I/O, Infineon, Kingston, Kodak, M-Systems, Matsushita, Memorex, Memory Plus, Micron, PNY, PQI, Pretec, Ritek, Samsung, SanDisk, Silicon Storage Technology, SimpleTech, SMART Modular Technologies, Sony, TDK, Transcend and Viking InterWorks.
