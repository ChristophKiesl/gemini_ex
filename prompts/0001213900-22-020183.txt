Item 1. Business
Background



We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 9, 2005 under the name of JML Holdings, Inc. and we subsequently merged with Baoshinn International Express, Inc. and changed our name to Baoshinn Corporation on January 10, 2006. We changed our name to Green Standard Technologies, Inc. on June 17, 2015andon May 19, 2016, we changed our name to ZZLL Information Technology, Inc. (the “Company”). 



On April 23, 2013, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Syndicore Asia Limited (“SAL”) under the laws of Hong Kong, which principally holds our ownership interest in Hunan Syndicore Asia Limited (“HSAL”), an e-Commerce company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”).



On August 18, 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Network Service Management Limited (“NSML”) to form Z-Line International E-Commerce Company Limited (“Z-Line”) under the laws of Hong Kong. We initially owned 55% of the equity interests in Z-Line, which was formed to provide consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business-sales services via web portals. On October 8, 2019, we acquired the remaining 45% equity interest in Z-Line from NSML. Z-Line has had limited operating activities since incorporation.



On May 23, 2020, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Shenzhen Ezekiel Technology Co. Limited (“Ezekiel”) under the laws of the PRC, which is engaged in the distribution of petroleum based products in the PRC.



We currently operate our business through our subsidiaries, SAL, HSAL and Ezekiel. The structure of our corporate organization is as follows:

Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act 



In December 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was signed into law. The HFCAA amended the Sarbanes Oxley Act to prohibit trading on U.S. exchanges of public reporting companies audited by audit firms located in foreign jurisdictions that the PCAOB has been unable to inspect for three sequential years. Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the  HFCAA, if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) determines that it cannot inspect or investigate completely our auditor.



Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021 which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in (i) the PRC because of a position taken by one or more authorities in the PRC and (ii) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations.



The PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections in China without the approval of Chinese government authorities. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken the PRC that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate.



Our auditor, WWC, P.C., is an independent registered public accounting firm with the PCAOB, and as an auditor of publicly traded companies in the U.S., is subject to laws in the U.S. pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. WWC, P.C. , is based in California and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis, including in December 2021. Should the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspection of our auditor’s work papers relating to our activity in the PRC, it will make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor’s audit procedures or equity control procedures. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures or quality of the financial statements, which would adversely affect us and our securities.



Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, our securities will likely be delisted.



Description of the Business



In 2021 and 2020 we were engaged in two business segments, (i) the e-commerce business, consisting of HSAL and SAL’s e-commerce operation and (ii) Ezekiel’s sales of petroleum based products and multi-function lottery machines.



HSAL’s e-Commerce business 



HSAL is an e-Commerce company that developed “Bibishengjia”, an online application based on a shopping search engine that concurrently searches many shopping sites, primarily based in China, including major shopping sites such as Taobao.com, Tmall.com, JD.com and Pinduoduo.com, and helps customers meet their one-stop online shopping needs. The shopping sites included in the Bibishengjia search engine pay us commissions for directing customers to their sites. Additionally, if a seller on a shopping site offers a rebate to the shopping site for purchases made from such seller, the shopping site typically shares such rebates with the search engine that directed the customer to the shopping site. Besides directing traffic to shopping sites, Bibishengjia also runs its own online shopping platforms - Bibi Mall and Lianlian Nongyuan Agricultural Products Store, and sources and resells agricultural and other goods on Bibishengjia. Bibi Mall and Lianlian Nongyuan Agricultural Products Store do not take possession of the products and use third party delivery services to pick up the products sold from vendors and deliver the goods to customers directly. Bibishengjia was launched on August 18, 2019 and is currently available for download at the Apple APP Store and other major mobile download stores.

On September 26, 2019, we, through SAL, entered into an agreement (the “Pretech Agreement”) with Pretech International Co., Limited (“Pretech”), a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong (“HK”). Pretech is a software, hardware and digital company that also specializes in the development and manufacture of consumer electronics. Under the terms of the Pretech Agreement, Pretech agreed to act as SAL’s sales agent to promote and bring more customers to Bibishengjia and also make sales of its own products through the use of Bibishengjia. Pretech paid $1 million for the use of Bibishengjia, and the Company agreed to pay Pretech 5% of all sales made in the PRC and HK through Bibishengjia. The term of the Pretech Agreement was initially for 24 months. On October 26, 2020, the Pretech Agreement was amended and restated whereby Pretech was given the right to use Bibishengjia directly for 7 years. When users browse the Bibishengjia APP, they are able to click on the Pretech hyperlink and be directed to Pretech’s own site where they can make purchases of Pretech’s products. Additional features and functions may be added to the APP according to the Pretech’s needs, markets conditions and additional requirements upon separate agreement between the parties, either in conjunction with the needs of SAL and HSAL or specifically for Pretech. Under the Pretech Agreement, the Bibishengjia APP, its contents and all related intellectual property rights including rights related to the Pretech hyperlink, are the sole property of SAL, including any additional developments or modifications made in the APP, in perpetuity Pretech’s use of Bibishengjia is accomplished by a section on the Bibishengjia APP created specifically for Pretech.



Ezekiel’s petroleum based products distribution business 



In October 2020, Ezekiel entered into the business of distribution of petroleum based products, such as asphalt, heat conduction oil and machine (lubricating) oil. Ezekiel’s suppliers include large Chinese state-owned enterprises as well as reputable private Chinese companies. Ezekiel doesn’t take possession of the petroleum based products sold to third parties, which are stored in the suppliers’ designated warehouses, and is not responsible for delivery to the customers.



Ezekiel’s multi-function lottery ticket machine business 



In late 2020, Ezekiel started a new business where it purchases custom-made multi-function lottery ticket machines and re-sells them to third parties. The machines are designed and manufactured by third parties with third party technologies. Ezekiel doesn’t own any intellectual property rights relating to the machines. Besides dispensing lottery tickets for which the machine owner retains 7-8% of the ticket sales price, the machines also function as a cellphone charging station for about $0.45 per hour and includes a disinfectant wipes dispenser. The machine has a LED screen which allows a customer to browse the Bibishengjia APP and make purchases there. Ezekiel has obtained licenses from several second and third-tier cities in the PRC where competition for lottery tickets sales and lottery tickets machines is manageable. The licenses allow the machines to dispense lottery tickets in these cities. Besides selling the machines to third parties, Ezekiel also plans to install, as owner and operator, the multi-function machines in cities where Ezekial has received licenses to sell lottery tickets.



The cost of each machine is approximately $950 and we sell these machines to third parties for approximately $1,375. We currently generate revenue from sales of our machines to third parties. If and when we are able to install machines, as an owner and operator, we expect to generate revenue from the fees retained on all lottery ticket sales made by the machines, and fees generated by the cellphone charging station.



Our Strategy



HSAL’s e-Commerce business 



We have been focusing on blue-collar millennials living in second and third tier cities in China as our targeted customers and intend to expand our footprint in such geographic areas. We also plan to include white collar millennials living in these cities as targeted customers. Our internally conducted survey indicates that office workers are interested in value shopping due to limitations on their disposable income.



Ezekiel’s petroleum based products distribution business 



Ezekiel’s suppliers include large Chinese state-owned enterprises as well as reputable private Chinese companies. Ezekiel plans to establish itself as a reliable distributor by offering quality products and services. Accordingly, it believes that developing and maintaining relationships with large state-owned suppliers and reputable privately-owned suppliers is a key to its business. Management believes that maintaining relationship with Ezekiel’s customers is also critical to its future success because substantially all of its sales in 20202021 came from one large customer, which management believes will continue to place purchase orders for large quantity of products. We plan to develop more customers and to increase the size of our business through referrals and from our existing business relationships.

Ezekiel’s multi-function lottery ticket machine business 



Our plan is to increase our market share and sales in second and third-tier cities in the PRC where competition for lottery tickets sales and lottery tickets machines is manageable..



Markets and Customers



HSAL’s e-Commerce business 



HSAL’s primary customers are blue-collar workers in their 20’s and 30’s living in second and third tier cities in China who are sensitive to product prices. We also plan to include white collar millennials living in these cities as targeted customers. According to data published by Sina Finance, about 61.58% of newly-added customers of major e-commerce websites in China during the 2019 holiday seasons were millennials living in third tier cities. The published data indicates 63.4% of the population in third tier cities in China prefer online shopping with a shopping frequency of 5.8 times per month. We intend to capitalize on these trends and demographics in our future marketing initiatives.



Ezekiel’s petroleum based products distribution business



Asphalt production is concentrated in the eastern part of China, and according to Caihui News, the demand gap in the western part of the country continues to expand. Our suppliers include large Chinese state-owned enterprises as well as reputable private Chinese companies who provide stable and high quality products to us. Purchasers of our goods are mainly state-owned enterprises with good credit.



For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Qingdao Jiuzhou Xintong Industry & Trade Co., Ltd. located in the city of Qingdao accounted for 77.85% of our total revenue, and one state-owned supplier, Yanchang Petroleum (Zhejiang FTZ) Limited, located in the city of Zhoushan accounted for 100% of our purchases.



Ezekiel’s multi-function lottery tickets machine business 



Lotteries are generally conducted to promote public welfare in the PRC and are uniformly operated and actively encouraged by the state. Depending on the type of the program, laws in the PRC mandate that a certain percentage of the lottery tickets sales will be used by the government to support state projects. Sports lotteries support national sports projects and welfare lotteries support the progress of social welfare such as state-run assisted living programs and orphanages. Data published by the China Welfare Lottery official website indicates that only 20%~30% of the annual lottery tickets sales in China are made through self-service methods (e.g. online sales), while in developed countries in Europe and the United States instant scratch-off lottery tickets account for 60% of the market share and self-service terminals are widely available. China’s scratch-off lottery tickets only account for 6% of the Chinese lottery market share. We believe that the market for self-service terminal-based lottery ticket sales is potentially large and that significant growth can be anticipated as the use of self-service machines become more popular and gain market acceptance.



We did not generate any revenues from the sale of multi-function lottery tickets machine in 2021 due to the pandemic and the lockdowns in China.



Marketing and Promotion



HSAL’s e-Commerce business 



We formed a partnership in March 2020 with the government of Hunan Province to help market local products on the Bibi Mall and Lianlian Nongyuan Agricultural Products Store on the Bibishengjia.APP. These products are otherwise hard to sell due to transportation and other logistical limitations.

We have historically promoted our APP on local TV programs and host community gatherings to share shopping experiences. In the third quarter of 2020, we started to promote the Bibishengjia. APP through “Momo”, a free social search and instant messaging mobile app with over 100 million monthly active live streaming users as of September 2020. We believe that mobile streaming media will accelerate our growth in the future. We registered Bibishengjia on Momo and have hired streamers/influencers who promote Bibishengjia. in their live streaming studios.



Ezekiel’s petroleum based products distribution business 



Because our suppliers include large Chinese state-owned enterprises as well as reputable private Chinese companies, we believe that we quickly became known for our stable and high-quality products. The entry barrier for this business is relatively high and we believe that an established business may not be easily duplicated by competitors. Members of Ezekiel’s management team have established personal relationships with suppliers and customers, and we aim to maintain these relationships as well as develop new relationships using personal connections and other industry resources in order to further establish ourselves and gain additional customers.

 

Ezekiel’s multi-function lottery tickets machine business 



We currently rely on trade shows to promote our machines to third party buyers. In addition to selling to third parties, we also plan to install the multi-function lottery ticket machines in strategically chosen second or third tier cities. The colorful moving images of lottery tickets on the LED screens of the machines help to attract customers . We have been exploring opportunities in many provinces and cities across the country with the goal of installing our own machines or selling machines to third parties in these locations.



Competition



HSAL’s e-Commerce business 



The shopping search e-commerce industry itself is a service industry and our Bibishengjia. App does not have distinguishable competitive advantage other than offering users the ability to purchase products at advantageous prices. Many non-shopping search e-commerce platforms now offer discounts on their products and large e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, JD, Pinduoduo, etc. have also created platforms that offer shopping search functions. As the competition in e-commerce increases , we believe that accurate traffic capture platforms with a traffic guidance model such as Bibishengjia. will offer unique advantages and gain popularity.



Ezekiel’s petroleum based products distribution business 



Our competitive advantage is that our suppliers include large Chinese state-owned enterprises as well as reputable private Chinese companies who provide stable and high quality products to us. However, we are in the early stages of business development and do not have an established reputation in the industry. In addition, costs for petroleum based products are significant and because our funds are limited, the scale of our business growth may be restricted.



Ezekiel’s multi-function lottery tickets machine business 



According to market surveys, China’s population accounts for about 19% of the world population, but accounts for only about 2% of global lottery sales. Only 10% of the population in China have purchased lottery tickets compared with more than 75% of the populations in developed countries such as the United States, France, and Japan, according to data published on the China Welfare Lottery official website. Currently in China, lottery tickets are mainly sold in ticket offices by sales people. In the developed countries, however, lottery ticket machines with self-service functions are installed in supermarkets, convenience stores, subways and other public places. We believe that the self-service lottery sales model will be the leading channel in the development of China’s lottery industry. Based on our survey, individuals who purchase lottery tickets in China at present have not formed the habit of buying lottery tickets from automatic terminals. Most customers still prefer to visit a physical lottery ticket sales office to meet like-minded people and enjoy tickets analysis services offered by the ticket sales offices. We may also encounter the problem that operating a lottery ticket machine may be challenging for some individuals.

In the Chinese lottery market, only lotteries permitted by the state can legally sell lottery tickets and lottery issuing agencies all are government-owned institutions. In addition to selling tickets themselves, lottery issuing agencies also authorize third parties to sell tickets. Competition among the lottery issuing agencies is fierce, and competition among their authorized lottery machine owners/operators is fierce as well.



We are currently competing against other lottery machine sellers. However, our custom-made multi-function lottery machines offer features and expanded applications that we believe the other machines don’t have, including a cellphone charger, a disinfectant wipes dispenser and a web shopping function. Paper currency transactions are not available on our machines. Customers can choose to use the online payment tool Alipay or the online social media WeChat to make contact-less purchases of lottery tickets. If a lottery player wins a prize, he can use the “scan code to redeem” function to redeem prizes on the spot. The prizes will be credited to the winner’s account in real time and the redemption process is safe and fast. If, as planned we install and operate the machines as an owner, , we will face competition from other lottery ticket dispensing machines that are also licensed to dispense tickets in the same city and from existing lottery ticket offices.. We will aim to gain a competitive advantages over other lottery machines through the promotion of the expanded applications on our machines.

 

Regulatory Compliance



Because substantially all of our business is conducted within the PRC, our operations are subject to regulations imposed by both the PRC and local governments. These include:
Regulations on Sales of Lottery Tickets and Lottery Ticket Machines. 



The lottery industry is heavily regulated in the PRC. Pursuant to the Lottery Administrative Regulations and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Lottery Administrative Regulations, the issuance of lottery tickets requires the State Council’s special permission. Lottery issuing agencies, lottery sales agencies and licensed lottery tickets sales companies must follow detailed rules in making lottery tickets sales, including a prohibition against false advertisements, unfair competition, selling lottery tickets to minors and selling lottery tickets on credit. Lottery equipment and related technical services must meet the standards prescribed by the law. A lottery sales company may sell lottery tickets only after it has received a lottery sales license from the lottery sales agencies. Licensed lottery tickets sales companies must meet specific qualification requirements, such as capital and location requirements, non-criminal records requirements and creditworthiness requirements. Licensed lottery tickets sales companies must also enter into a form contract formulated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and other national government agencies in order to become qualified. The form contract has to specifically set forth the provision and management of the lottery machines.
Regulations on Annual Inspection.



In accordance with relevant PRC laws, all types of enterprises incorporated under PRC laws are required to conduct annual inspections with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the PRC or its local branches. In addition, foreign invested enterprises are subject to annual inspections conducted by other applicable PRC governmental authorities. In order to reduce enterprises’ burden of submitting inspection documentation to different governmental authorities, the Measures on Implementing Joint Annual Inspection on Foreign-invested Enterprises issued in 1998 by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), together with six other ministries, stipulated that foreign-invested enterprises must participate in an annual inspection jointly conducted by all relevant PRC governmental authorities.
Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange.



Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 2008 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) and the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities, Renminbi are freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require prior approval from SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as US dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.




-6-







Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE or its local counterpart. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency receipts into Renminbi. On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated a circular regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its registered capital in foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. This circular stipulates that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. Violations of this circular can result in severe penalties, including monetary fines.



In addition, any foreign loans to an operating subsidiary in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its approved total investment amount and its approved “registered capital amount”.



Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions. 



In October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75, which regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a “special purpose vehicle” by PRC residents to seek offshore equity financing and conduct “return investment” in China. Under Circular 75, a “special purpose vehicle” refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC citizens or PRC entities (collectively, as PRC residents) for the purpose of seeking offshore equity financing using assets or interests owned by such PRC residents or PRC entities in onshore companies, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents through the use of “special purpose vehicles,” including without limitation, establishing foreign invested enterprises and using such foreign invested enterprises to purchase or control (by way of contractual arrangements) onshore assets. Circular 75 requires that, before establishing or controlling a “special purpose vehicle,” PRC residents are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the competent local counterparts of SAFE for their overseas investments. In addition, such PRC resident is required to amend his or her SAFE registration or to file with SAFE or its competent local branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose vehicle in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China by the offshore special purpose vehicle. To further clarify the implementation of such amendment or filing procedure, SAFE requires domestic enterprises under Circular 75 to coordinate and supervise such amendment or filings with SAFE or its local counterparts by such PRC residents. If PRC residents fail to comply, the domestic enterprises are required to report to the local SAFE authorities.



Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including being prohibited from distributing its profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to its offshore parent or affiliate, and restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital from the offshore entity to the PRC entities, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations.



Regulation of Overseas Listings.



On August 8, 2006, The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”), the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, State Administration of Taxation (the “SAT”), the SAIC and SAFE jointly promulgated the “Rules on the Mergers and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors,” which became effective on September 8, 2006, and was further amended on June 22, 2009, or the M&A Rules. Among other things, the M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle, or SPV, formed for listing purposes and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals must obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such SPV’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings. However, the application of this PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement to various types of transactions, including those which involve the use of variable interest entity agreements.

Regulations of Dividend Distribution.



Under current applicable laws and regulations, each of our consolidated PRC entities may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our consolidated PRC entities is required to deposit at least ten percent (10%) of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year into its statutory surplus reserve fund until the accumulative amount of such reserve reaches fifty percent (50%) of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation.



The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies a 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except to the extent tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax.



Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as “resident enterprises” clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC “resident enterprises” will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10%, when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects such PRC “resident enterprises” to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities.



Under the implementation regulations to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders’ meetings; and 50% or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights.



Seasonality



Our management believes that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences, except during the two-week period before the “Singles’ Day” (November 11) and Chinese New Year’s Day our Bibishengjia online sales increase.



Employees 



As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 18 employees working in China, performing sales, operational and administrative functions and 2 employees in Hong Kong, performing managerial functions. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. We have taken necessary precautions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including offering employees flexibility to work from home and mandatory social distancing requirements in the workplace.
