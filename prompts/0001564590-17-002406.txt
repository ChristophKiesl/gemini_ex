ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 Overview   Glatfelter began operations in 1864, and we believe we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of specialty papers and fiber-based engineered materials. We are headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, and we own and operate manufacturing facilities in, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the Philippines and we have sales and distribution offices in Russia and China. We are constructing a new manufacturing facility in Arkansas which is expected to be operational by the end of 2017. Exclusive of Arkansas, our ten manufacturing facilities have a combined production capacity of approximately 1.1 million tons of specialty papers and airlaid products used in a wide array of applications. 
 Strategy   Our strategy is focused on growing, organically and by acquisition, in our key global growth markets including single-serve coffee and tea products, nonwoven wall cover materials, electrical products, hygiene and wipes products, and other technical engineered materials. We partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands and grow our revenue. We are committed to growing in our key markets and expect to make additional investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands. Consistent with this strategy, we are investing approximately $80 million to build a new advanced airlaid facility in Arkansas to service the North America market. Production at the new facility is expected to begin in late 2017 with annual production capacity of approximately 22,000 short tons. The investment increases our total global airlaid materials capacity to approximately 129,000 short tons. 
 New product development and new business development are critical components of our business. 

  During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested $10.3 million, $10.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively, in new product development activities. In each of the past three years, in excess of 50% of net sales were generated from products developed, enhanced or improved within the past five years.
 In addition, our business strategy includes expanding product margins and generating strong free cash flows driven by delivering on cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives and by making strategic investments designed to improve our returns on invested capital.
 Acquisitions   Over the past several years, we have completed a number of acquisitions that have diversified our revenue, expanded our geographic footprint and enhanced our asset base. Our acquisition strategy is focused on targeting investments in adjacent or closely related markets and which complement our long-term strategy of driving growth in core markets. Since 2006, we have successfully completed six acquisitions demonstrating our ability to establish leading market positions through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses.
 Business Units   We manage our company as three separate business units: Composite Fibers; Advanced Airlaid Materials; and Specialty Papers. Consolidated net sales and the relative net sales contribution of each of our business units for the past three years are summarized below:

Dollars in thousands | 2016 | | | 2015 | | | 2014 |

Composite Fibers   Our Composite Fibers business unit serves customers globally and focuses on higher value-added products in the following markets:
 
• | Food & Beverage filtration paper primarily used for single-serve coffee and tea products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wallcovering base materials used by the world’s largest wallpaper manufacturers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


GLATFELTER 2016 FORM 10-K | 1

• | Metallized products used in labels, packaging liners, gift wrap, and other consumer product applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Composite Laminates paper used in production of decorative laminates, furniture, and flooring applications; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technical Specialties a diverse line of special paper products used in applications such as electrical energy storage, transport and transmission, wipes, and other highly-engineered fiber-based applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe Composite Fibers maintains a market leadership position in the single-serve coffee and tea markets, nonwoven wallcover base material and many others of the products it produces. This business unit’s revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014 | 
-----------------------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Food & beverage | $ | 258,463 | | $ | 274,865 | | $ | 296,304
Wallcovering | | 90,767 | | | 91,620 | | | 149,957
Metallized | | 61,059 | | | 68,397 | | | 80,839 
Composite laminates | | 35,107 | | | 34,897 | | | 38,159 
Technical specialties and other | | 71,558 | | | 71,689 | | | 52,592 
Total | $ | 516,954 | | $ | 541,468 | | $ | 617,851

 
A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates unfavorably affected the comparison of 2016 to 2015 by $11.1 million and by $75.8 million in the comparison of 2015 to 2014.
 We believe many of the markets served by Composite Fibers present attractive growth opportunities due to evolving consumer preferences, new or emerging geographic markets, and increased market share through superior products and quality. We also believe growth opportunities exist as a result of new product innovations. Many of this business’ papers are extremely lightweight, technically sophisticated, require specialized fibers, and require specifically designed papermaking equipment and production processes. Our proven capability to produce these demanding products and our focus on customer relationships positions us well to compete in these global markets.
 The primary raw materials used in the production of our lightweight papers are abaca pulp, wood pulp and synthetic fibers. Sufficient quantities of abaca pulp and its source abaca fiber are required to support growth in this business unit. Abaca pulp, a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability, is produced by our Philippine mill, which provides a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers business unit. In the event the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources 

  and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands.
 The Composite Fibers business unit is comprised of five paper making facilities (Germany, France and England), two metallizing operations (Wales and Germany) and a pulp mill (the Philippines). The combined attributes of the facilities are summarized as follows:
 
 
Production Capacity (short tons) | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
---------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------
155,500 lightweight and other paper | Abaca pulp | | 14,500
 | Wood pulp | | 93,000
 | Synthetic fiber | | 22,000
28,000 metallized | Base stock | | 28,000
18,000 abaca pulp | Abaca fiber | | 25,800

 
Composite Fibers’ lightweight products are produced using highly specialized inclined wire paper machine technology. We believe we currently maintain approximately 25% of the global inclined wire capacity.
 In addition to critical raw materials, Composite Fibers’ production cost is influenced by energy prices, particularly natural gas. The business unit generates all of its steam needed for production by burning natural gas. However, in 2016, it purchased approximately 75% of its electricity needs the cost of which is influenced by the natural gas markets.
 In Composite Fibers’ markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single serve coffee & tea | Ahlstrom, Purico, MB Papeles and Zhejiang Kan 
Nonwoven wallcovering | Technocell, Neu Kaliss, and Goznak 
Composite laminates | Schweitzer-Maudit, Purico, MB Papeles and Oi Feng 
Metallized | AR Metallizing, Torras Papel Novelis, Vaassen, Galileo Nanotech, and Wenzhou Protec Vacuum Metallizing Co.

 
Our strategy in Composite Fibers is focused on:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Airlaid Materials Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit is a leading global supplier of highly absorbent cellulose-based airlaid nonwoven materials primarily used to manufacture consumer products for growing global end-user markets. The markets served by Advanced Airlaid Materials include:

• | feminine hygiene;
--+------------------


• | specialty wipes;
--+-----------------


• | adult incontinence;
--+--------------------


• | home care; and
--+---------------


• | other consumer products.
--+-------------------------

 Advanced Airlaid Materials serves customers who are industry leading consumer product companies as well as private label converters. We believe this business unit holds leading market share positions in many of the markets it serves. Advanced Airlaid Materials has developed long-term customer relationships through superior quality, customer service, and a reputation for quickly bringing product and process innovations to market.
 Advanced Airlaid Materials’ revenue composition by market consisted of the following for the years indicated:
 
 
In thousands | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014 | 
-------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+------+--
Feminine hygiene | $ | 173,902 | | $ | 182,048 | | $ | 216,836
Specialty wipes | | 25,206 | | | 22,950 | | | 16,002 
Adult incontinence | | 12,281 | | | 10,720 | | | 17,586

Other | | 20,243 | | | 15,526 | | | 15,848 
Total | $ | 244,262 | | $ | 244,589 | | $ | 281,673

 
A significant portion of this business unit’s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates unfavorably affected the comparison of 2015 to 2014 by $25.1 million. The effect of currency changes was not material in 2016 compared with 2015.
 The feminine hygiene category accounted for 71% of Advanced Airlaid Material’s revenue in 2016. The majority of sales of this product are to a small group of large, leading global consumer products companies. These markets are considered to be more growth oriented due to population growth in certain geographic regions and changing consumer preferences. In developing 

  regions, demand is also influenced by increases in disposable income and cultural preferences. 
 The Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit operates state-of-the-art facilities in Falkenhagen, Germany and Gatineau, Canada. The Falkenhagen location operates three multi-bonded production lines and three proprietary single-lane festooners. The Gatineau location consists of two airlaid production lines employing multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies and two proprietary single-lane festooners. In addition, we are building a new production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas which is expected to be operational in late 2017 with an annual capacity of approximately 22,000 short tons and will primarily serve the growing demand for wipes and hygiene airlaid products in North America.
 The business unit’s two existing facilities operate with the following combined attributes:
 
 
Airlaid Production Capacity (short tons) | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
-----------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------
 | 107,000 | | Fluff pulp | | 81,000

 
In addition to the cost of critical raw materials, our cost to produce is impacted by energy. Advanced Airlaid Materials purchases substantially all of the electricity and natural gas used in its operations. Approximately 90% of this business unit’s revenue is earned under contracts with pass-through provisions directly related to the cost of key raw materials.
 Advanced Airlaid Materials continues to be a technology and product innovation leader in technically demanding segments of the airlaid market. This business unit’s airlaid material production employs multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies as opposed to other methods such as hydrogen-bonding. We believe that its facilities are among the most modern and flexible airlaid facilities in the world, allowing it to produce at industry leading operating rates. Its proprietary single-lane festooning technology provides converting and product packaging which supports efficiency optimization by the customers converting processes. This business unit’s in-house technical expertise, combined with significant capital investment requirements and rigorous customer expectations creates large barriers to entry for new competitors.
 The following summarizes this business unit’s key competitors:

Many of the market segments served by Specialty Papers are characterized by declining demand resulting in an industry with excess capacity, lower operating rates and pricing pressure. As a result, over the past several years, certain producers have closed, reduced or repurposed production capacity in an attempt to bring supply balance to the market. In addition, foreign producers have created additional imbalance by shipping product to the U.S. when market pricing is favorable or the U.S. dollar is stronger. Maintaining the supply and demand balance will require 

  the industry to continually remove capacity sufficient to match declining demand.
 Despite our exposure to these declining markets, in each of the past twelve years, we have outperformed the broader uncoated free sheet market in terms of shipping volume. We have been successful at maintaining this business unit’s shipments by leveraging the flexibility of our assets base to respond to new product and new business development opportunities, efficiently responding to changing customer demands and delivering superior customer service.
 We are one of the leading suppliers of carbonless and book publishing papers in the United States. Although the markets for these products are declining, we have been successful in executing our strategy to replace this lost volume with products such as envelope papers, business forms, and other value-added specialty engineered products. Specialty Papers envelope papers market is also declining, however we have leveraged our customer service capabilities and geographic locations to grow our market share in each of the last several years.
 Specialty Papers’ highly technical engineered products include high speed ink jet printing papers, office specialty products, greeting cards, packaging, casting, release, transfer, playing card, postal, FDA-compliant food and other niche specialty applications. Such products comprise an array of distinct business niches that are in a continuous state of evolution. Many of these products are utilized for demanding, specialized customer and end-user applications. Some of our products are new and higher growth while others are more mature and further along in the product life cycle. Because many of these products are technically complex and involve substantial customer-supplier development collaboration, they typically command higher per ton prices and generally exhibit greater pricing stability relative to commodity grade paper products.
 The Specialty Papers business unit operates two integrated pulp and paper making facilities with the following combined attributes:
 
 
Uncoated Production Capacity (short tons) | | Principal Raw Material (“PRM”) | | Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) | 
------------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+----------
 | 815,000 | | Pulpwood | | 2,340,000
 | | | Wood- and other pulps | | 730,000 

 
This business unit’s pulp mills have a combined pulp making capacity of 620,000 tons of bleached pulp per year. The principal raw material used to produce pulp is pulpwood, including both hardwoods and softwoods. Pulpwood is obtained from a variety of locations including the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. To protect our sources of pulpwood, we actively promote conservation and forest management among suppliers and woodland owners.

  The Spring Grove facility includes four uncoated paper machines as well as an off-line blade coater and a specialty coater which together provide annual production capacity for coated paper of approximately 65,000 tons. The Chillicothe facility operates four paper machines producing uncoated and carbonless paper. Two of the machines have built-in coating capability which along with three additional coaters across the Ohio operations’ facilities provide annual coated capacity of approximately 126,000 tons.
 In addition to critical raw materials, the cost to produce Specialty Papers’ products is influenced by energy. In 2016, the business unit generated all of its steam needed for production and generated more power than it consumes at the Spring Grove, PA facility, and it purchased approximately 25% of its electricity needed for the Chillicothe, OH mill. In connection with the conversion of the fuel source for its boilers from coal beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, for the Chillicothe, OH mill and the first quarter of 2017, for the Spring Grove, PA mill, both facilities’ source of fuel is now predominantly natural gas. 
 In Specialty Papers’ markets, competition is product line specific due to the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing for certain products. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:
 
 
Market segment | Competitor 
---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbonless paper and forms | Appvion, Inc., and to a lesser extent, Fibria Celulose, Koehler Paper, Mitsubishi Paper, Nekoosa Coated Products and Asia Pulp and Paper Co.
Engineered products | Specialty papers divisions of International Paper, Domtar Corp., Packaging Corp, and Sappi Limited, among others. 
Envelope & converting | Domtar and International Paper 
Book publishing | Domtar Corp., North Pacific Paper (NORPAC), Resolute Forest and others 

 
Customer service, product performance, technological advances and product pricing are important competitive factors with respect to all our products. We believe our reputation in these areas continues to be excellent.
 To be successful in the market environment in which Specialty Papers operates, our strategy is focused on:
 
• | new product and new business development capabilities to ensure optimal utilization of our capacity and to maximize margins;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging our flexible operating platform to optimize product mix by shifting production among the machines in our system to more closely match output with changing demand trends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | driving operational excellence by utilizing ongoing continuous improvement
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional financial information for each of our business units is included in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24 including geographic revenue and long-lived asset financial information.
 Concentration of Customers   For each of the past three years, no single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. However, as discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, one customer accounted for the majority of Advanced Airlaid Materials net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 Capital Expenditures   Our business is capital intensive and requires significant expenditures for equipment enhancements to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, environmental compliance and for normal upgrades or replacements. Capital expenditures totaled $160.2 million, $99.9 million and $66.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For 2017, capital expenditures are estimated as follows:

In millions | Low | | | High |

Total | $ | 125 | – | | $ | 140

Environmental Matters   We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect the environment as well as human health and safety. At various times, we have incurred significant costs to comply with these regulations and we could incur additional costs as new regulations are developed or regulatory priorities change.
 We have incurred material capital costs to comply with new air quality regulations including the U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule (BART; otherwise known as the Regional Haze Rule) and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule (Boiler MACT). In order to comply with these rules, during 2015 and 2016 we completed process modifications on boilers at two of our facilities. We converted or replaced five coal-fired boilers to natural gas and upgraded site infrastructure to accommodate the new boilers, including connecting to a gas supply. The cost of these projects totaled approximately $113 million.
 We are a defendant in the Fox River environmental site, a complex and significant matter. For a more
