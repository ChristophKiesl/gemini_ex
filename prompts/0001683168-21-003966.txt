Our Strategy
 
Today, more businesses are seeking to streamline their operations by connecting their machines and electronic devices to the Internet, manage them remotely, and create new business models. The growth in the IoT and REM markets are being driven by the growing importance of data, being able to act on that data, and the rapidly falling cost of sensors, connectivity, compute, and storage. While the promise is great, designing and deploying these projects is complex, costly and time-consuming. Our offerings are designed to help companies increase speed and reduce friction for their deployments through reduced complexity, decreased development costs, and increased ease of management for web-scale applications and real-world solutions; thus, driving customer value and success. We plan to address the market opportunity by offering our customers turnkey solutions by leveraging the layers of the IoT Stack, such as Collect, Connect, Compute, Control and Comprehend, through a combination of services, hardware and software solutions, accessible and manageable through our SaaS platform.
 
We are executing a growth strategy that includes continuous innovation complemented by strategic acquisitions to expand our ability to offer complete IoT and REM solutions with the intent of increasing our scale and broadening our scope so that we can increase our value proposition to our customers. We believe this strategy will allow us to address a larger portion of our customers’ operational needs and engage with customers as a strategic "total solution" partner. We believe this will strengthen our position in the market as our customers come to us for a wider variety of solutions.
