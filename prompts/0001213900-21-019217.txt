Item 1. Business. 
 
We are a leading developer of contactless payment solutions, Near Field Communication (NFC) technology based, for the unattended market. We have been a technology leader since 1990, providing systems, devices and services to operators and integrators with solutions and components that are simple to implement.
 
To date, we have deployed over one million payment solutions to our focused unattended markets: self-service kiosk, micro-markets and vending machines, entertainment and gaming, automated teller machines, or ATM, Mass Transit Ticketing Validation, and fuel payments.
 
We operate through regional offices, supporting clients and payment industry partners with its unique contactless payment solutions.
 
On March 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement, or the Sale Agreement, for the sale of 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of our wholly owned Polish subsidiary, ASEC S.A., or ASEC, with Vector Software SP. Z O.O., or the Buyer. ASEC is headquartered in Krakow, Poland and has been conducting our Mass Transit Ticketing business in Europe.  The consideration for ASEC is $3,000,000, of which approximately $2,100,000 shall be used to repay Polish banks loans at the closing date, as mentioned in the Sale Agreement, further offset by minor adjustments. The Sale Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants, including an undertaking we provided not to compete with the business of ASEC for a period of five years after the closing and an undertaking to indemnify ASEC and the Buyer for certain damages. Our liability is limited to the purchase price actually paid by the Buyer.
 
In addition, we engaged an investment bank to explore strategic options and are investing resources in this process.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel on February 15, 1990, under the name of De-Bug Innovations Ltd., with unlimited duration. Our name was changed to On Track Innovations Ltd. on July 8, 1991. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies, under registration number 52-004286-2 and our Ordinary Shares are quoted on the OTCQX® market, or OTCQX, under the symbol OTIVF.
 
Our Markets 
 
We plan to continue to support our growing unattended markets which are self-service kiosks, micro-markets and vending machines, entertainment and gaming, ATM, mass transit ticketing validation, and fuel payments.
 
We believe that worldwide events including the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating the trend towards adoption of unattended contactless payments in these markets.
 
Our Products 
 
We combine a unique radio frequency, or RF technology with an “open garden” approach, and we enable our customers and partners to pick and choose products and services from our wide offering.
 
Our solutions include: Readers, Controllers and Terminals, Management Software, Payment Services, and a complete Payment System as a Service (PSaaS).
 
OTI Readers
 
We supply NFC and contactless payment reader products and solutions. Our products and solutions are approved by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., or UL, and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and certified by MasterCard TQM (Terminal Quality Management).

Controllers and Terminals 
 
Controllers and Terminals are hardware devices that manage the flow of data between two machines and are used to “control” a peripheral device (e.g., a vending machine). We have a range of Controllers and Terminals that provide secured and certified access to payment service providers which enable contactless payment acceptance, connectivity, and cloud-based management for machines.
 
Management software 
 
We provide a cloud-based software for Self-Service Kiosks, Micro-Markets, Vending and any Pulse machines that provides real-time control and insights of each machine, enabling operators to remotely manage their terminal’s fleet.
 
Payment Services 
 
Our payment services include the following payment options:
 

● | Payment Service API - a simple and powerful application programming interface, or API, to our payment servers to provide our customers and partners access to a certified Europay Mastercard Visa, or EMV, system to enable a fast and secured integration to new processors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Close Loop Payment - extending EMV payment, we offer support for close-loop payment cards with different technologies such as MIFARE and Mag-Stripe. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile Payment - we provide APIs for effortless and smooth integration with mobile payment solutions, enabling mobile payments on our system. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A complete Payment System as a Service (PSaaS) 
 
Our system is a modular, cost-effective solution for self-service kiosks, micro-markets, vending and any pulse machines which enable contactless payments.
 
The complete PSaaS system incorporates telemetry, sales and operations into an all-inclusive solution that makes any kiosk, pulse or vending business connected and interactive, providing cloud control with real-time online management and alerts.
 
Industry Background
 
Under certain regulations and credit card anti-fraud legislations, the use of contactless payment technologies has become an essential requirement for both consumers and retailers. Various market sectors have begun to massively adopt contactless payments and are constantly looking for ways to make the adoption process as convenient as possible for both merchants and customers. Millions of contactless debit and credit cards are issued annually by leading financial institutions to various consumers, and merchants are looking to install contactless payment readers that can be easily integrated into their existing unattended point of sale locations.
 
The world’s leading smartphone manufacturers are either including or are expected to include NFC support in their upcoming handset upgrades, which will enhance the technology adoption lifecycle. Whether it is a standard contactless travel card, or EMV contactless card, or an NFC mobile phone, the main motive is to provide quick and efficient payment solutions. Leading smartphone manufacturers have also introduced and are actively pushing the use of their own contactless payment solutions such as Apple Pay™, Google Pay™ and Samsung Pay™, all of which require a contactless reader to be available at the merchant countertop.
 
In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards adoption of unattended contactless payments in these markets.

Strategy 
 
Our goal is to maintain our status as a leading developer of NFC and cashless payment technologies and our reputation as a manufacturer of top-quality products carrying the highest certification standards. We have been working for the past few months on updating our strategy for the coming years, which we believe will enable us to realize our potential and resume our growth, and ultimately create shareholder value. In addition, we engaged an investment bank to explore strategic options and are investing resources in this process.
 
Key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal include:
 

● | Expanding our global market presence. We market our products through regional offices in the United States, Europe, Africa and our headquarters in Israel. We are using our headquarters and regional offices to strengthen our presence in existing markets, penetrate new markets, provide local customer service and technical support, and adapt our products to our local customers’ specific needs. We continue to expand our market presence via strategic partners and distributors around the globe. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing our focus on generating high-margin, recurring revenues. We are continuing our strategy to shift from hardware sales to SaaS and in upgrading our hardware to maintain our technological lead. We intend to generate additional recurring revenues by receiving service fees for ongoing customer services and transaction fees from our customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhancing our technological position. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to develop new technologies, extend the functionality of our products and services, and offer innovative products and services to our customers and partners. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer Service and Technical Support
 
We provide our customers with training, installation support, ongoing customer service and technical support through our regional offices, distributors and local services providers, including employees located in our corporate headquarters in Yokneam, Israel, as well as employees located in our offices in Europe, South Africa and the United States. Our customer service teams in Yokneam provide central services to our global network. Our offices, distributors and local providers, in turn, provide customer service and technical support by telephone and email.
Sales and Marketing
 
In addition to selling our products and solutions through our distributors, we sell and market our products directly and through our regional offices. We market and sell our products in the Americas through our U.S.-based subsidiary, OTI America. In Africa, our subsidiary in South Africa, OTI PetroSmart, and in Europe, our subsidiary in Poland, OTI Europe Sp.z.o.o. In Israel and in regions where we do not have local subsidiaries or representatives, we market and sell through our main headquarters in Yokneam, Israel. Our marketing and sales staff implement marketing campaigns and programs to promote our products and services to enhance our global brand recognition. Our current marketing efforts include participation in digital events, webinars, press releases, websites, social media and client / distributor meetings. We also conduct technical seminars to inform sales staff, customers, distributors, business partners and other industry contributors of our unique products and innovative technologies.
Customers
 
Our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers. The customers we consider to be our major customers and the percentage of our revenue represented by each major customer vary from period to period. In 2020 and 2019, a customer in North America accounted for 19% and 20%, respectively, of our total revenues for such periods. Another customer in Asia accounted for 14% and 6% of our total revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively. An additional customer in Europe accounted for 12% and 13% of our total revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively. If we were to lose any one of our major customers, or if any of our customers were to have difficulty meeting their financial obligations to us for any reason, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Manufacturing 
 
We outsource all our manufacturing and product assemblies to third-party vendors. Whenever possible, our policy is to use more than one supplier and manufacturing subcontractor for each part of our production process in order to limit dependence on any one source.
 
We are ISO 9001:2015 certified. We require that our suppliers and subcontractors be ISO 9001:2015 certified. ISO 9001:2015 is an international standard promulgated by the International Standards Organization, which specifies requirements for a quality management system and provides guidance and tools for companies to ensure that their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements. This standard is updated from time to time pursuant to the international authorization requirements.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Most of our products are subject to local electromagnetic compliance, or EMC/Radio regulations such as radiation, conducted emission and immunity, and safety regulations such as fire and electrical hazards, governed by low voltage standards for our regular readers and hazardous areas standards for our petroleum products. In the United States, EMC/Radio testing and certification for such products are governed by Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15 while safety testing and certification fall under the standards set by UL. In the rest of the world, where FCC and UL rules do not apply, we follow various international and local standards for EMC/Radio and safety. The compliance with these standards is assured by testing and certifying our products at various accredited labs and/or notified bodies located both in Israel and other countries (e.g., United States, Germany, South Africa, India, China, Brazil and more). Our products comply with the regulations in the markets in which we operate.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success depends on, among other things, our ability to maintain our technological leadership, enhance our existing products and develop new products, technologies and solutions. Accordingly, we intend to continue devoting substantial resources to research and development.
 
Our research and development activities focus on two major areas:
 

● | developing new innovative technologies related to the contactless payment solutions market; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | enhancing the functionality of our components and expanding the range of our products to serve new markets. 

 
Our main research and development facilities are located at our headquarters in Israel. We believe that our success is based on our experienced team of senior engineers and technicians who have extensive experience in their respective fields. Our research and development facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified.
 
Proprietary Technologies and Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology and IP. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law, as well as know-how, confidentiality agreements and other contractual relationships with our customers, employees, affiliates, agents, consultants, distributors and others.
 
Our IP portfolio includes issued patents with respect to our contactless technology, as well as trademarks and designs. As part of our efficiency program, we have reduced our investment in non-core patents and registrations. The expiration dates for our granted patents range between 2027 to 2033.
 
We do not know whether any issued patents will be enforceable against alleged infringers or will be upheld if their validity is challenged. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers, partners, employees, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors, and generally control access to the distribution of our products, documentation and other proprietary information.

Competition
 
Our competition is with technology vendors that provide contactless payments solutions products and technologies:
 

● | In the Kiosk, Micro markets and Vending markets, our competition includes unattended payment solution and technology providers such as ID Tech, Nayax and Ingenico. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the Petroleum Market, we compete with fueling and fleet management end-to-end solution vendors such as Orpak and Hectronic. As this domain has high entrance barriers, competition in this field is limited. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 121 employees. This number includes approximately 40 employees of ASEC that on March 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell.
  
We operate in accordance with the applicable law and the provisions of the general extension orders applying to labor and employment relations in Israel. These provisions principally concern the length of the working day, minimum wages for employees, contributions to pension funds or managers’ insurance, contribution to work disability insurance, convalescence, travel expenses, holidays and other conditions of employment. We provide our employees with benefits and working conditions above the required minimum and which we believe are competitive with benefits and working conditions provided by similar companies in our industry in Israel. Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We have written employment agreements with substantially all of our employees. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and it may be difficult to attract or maintain qualified personnel to our offices. We dedicate significant resources to employee retention and have never experienced work stoppages, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. Our subsidiaries located outside Israel operate in accordance with the local applicable labor laws and have written employment agreements with substantially all their employees.
 
SEC Filings
 
The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
We maintain a corporate website www.otiglobal.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website and the other websites referenced above do not constitute a part of this annual report on Form 10-K. We have included these website addresses in this annual report on Form 10-K solely as inactive textual references.
