 Item 1. Business
 ﻿
 General Information
 ﻿
 Mobivity Holdings Corp. (the “Company” or “we”) is in the business of developing and operating proprietary platforms over which brands and enterprises can conduct national and localized, data-driven mobile marketing campaigns. Our proprietary platforms, consisting of software available to phones, tablets PCs, and Point of Sale (“POS”) systems, allow resellers, brands and enterprises to market their products and services to consumers through text messages sent directly to the consumers via mobile phones, mobile smartphone applications, and dynamically printed receipt content. We generate revenue by charging the resellers, brands and enterprises a per-message transactional fee, through fixed or variable software licensing fees, or via advertising fees. We help restaurant and retail brands realize their strategy of growing their business by increasing customer frequency, engagement and spend. Mobivity's analytics and products provide solutions that allow brands to take validated marketing actions across all channels, based on real customer behavior to create personalized, relevant, localized and targeted campaigns. With national clients such as Subway, Sonic, Chick-fil-A, and Baskin-Robbins, Mobivity's goal is to unlock the power of internal and external customer data to create a system that provides data driven insight to continually adapt and enhance communications with customers. 
     According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 7% of commerce in the US occurs online which means 93% is still happening in the physical world. We believe that brands, and in particular restaurant and retail brands, need a better way to tie marketing activities to customer purchases, and then use the information to build a more relevant, personal experience for each customer, at a local and national level. Mobivity is giving brands the ability to connect (and measure) marketing communications in the physical world by unlocking POS and mobile data and marrying it with other traditional tactics to create a closed loop: in some cases increasing response rates from 0.05% to 5% (or greater); improving online advertising conversion by 10X; and increasing revenue per ad by more than 2.5X.
 ﻿
 Mobivity’s solution addresses the offline marketing problem and makes personalized marketing automation possible for offline commerce.  Digital marketing is highly dynamic and personally targeted. According to studies published by McKinsey & Company, Point Drive, and the National Advertising Institute, targeted advertising generates conversion rates more than eleven times higher than non-targeted advertising, more than double the revenue per advertisement, and is 250% more efficient than non-targeted advertising. Combined with purchase data and analytics gathered by Mobivity’s products and platforms, Mobivity customers are able to quickly transform traditionally low marketing campaign response rates to exponentially higher response rates.
 ﻿
 Mobile phone users represent a large and captive audience. While televisions, radios, and even PCs are often shared by multiple consumers, mobile phones are personal devices representing a unique and individual address to the end user. We believe that the future of digital media will be significantly influenced by mobile phones where a direct, personal conversation can be had with the world’s largest target audience. According to a report published by comScore in January 2014, more U.S. Internet users accessed the Internet through mobile devices than through PCs. Additionally, consumers now spend more time using the mobile Internet on smartphones than using the Internet via PCs according to the 2014 Digital Consumer Report published by Nielsen.

Our “C4” Mobile Marketing and customer relationship management platform is a Web-hosted software solution enabling our clients to develop, execute, and manage a variety of marketing engagements to a consumer’s mobile phone. Our C4 solution allows our clients to communicate directly with their customers through Short Messaging Service, or SMS, multi-media messaging, smartphone application development and interactive voice response interactions, all of which are facilitated via a set of graphical user interfaces operated from any Web browser.
 ﻿
 Our C4 platform also allows our customers to deploy and administer our “Stampt” mobile device loyalty application. Stampt is a smartphone replacement for “Buy 10, Get 1 free” punch cards. Consumers no longer need to worry about forgetting paper-based loyalty punch cards. Stampt makes it easy to receive all of the rewards consumers want from their favorite businesses. Consumers can use Stampt throughout the United States to earn free sandwiches, coffee, pizza, frozen yogurt, donuts, bagels and more. Stampt’s nearby feature shows consumers all of the rewards they can earn at nearby businesses. From the Stampt mobile device application, consumers simply tap any business to learn more about that business and to see all of the loyalty points they have earned at that business. Consumers can keep track of all of the rewards they are close to earning through the “my cards” feature displayed in the application’s interface. Once a consumer has earned all of the Stampts they need for a reward, they simply show the cashier and click “tap to redeem” button from the application interface on their device. Our customers can create and manage any Stampt program from the C4 platform’s set of Web-based interfaces.
 ﻿
 Our “SmartReceipt” solution enables our customers with the ability to control the content on receipts printed from their point of sale, or POS system. SmartReceipt is a software application that is installed on the POS, or directly onto receipt printer platforms, such as Epson’s OmniLink product, which dynamically controls what is printed on receipts such as coupons, announcements, or other calls-to-action, such as invitations to participate in a survey. SmartReceipt includes a Web-based interface where users can design receipt content and implement business rules to dictate what receipt content is printed in particular situations. All receipt content is also transmitted to SmartReceipt’s server back-end for storage and analysis. Our SmartReceipt solution is fully integratable with our C4 platform and allows our customers to print SMS marketing or Stampt mobile application calls-to-action on receipts.
 ﻿
 We also offer our clients reporting and analytics capabilities through the C4 solution which allows our clients to assess and optimize their mobile marketing and SmartReceipt campaigns. Our proprietary platform connects to all wireless carriers so that any consumer, on any wireless service (for example, Verizon), can join our customer’s SMS mobile marketing campaign. Once the consumer has subscribed to our customer’s SMS mobile marketing campaign, our C4 Web-based software solution serves as a tool by which our customers can initiate messages and other communications back to their subscribed consumers, as well as configure and administer their mobile marketing campaigns.
 ﻿
 Company Strategy
 ﻿
 Our objective is to build an industry-leading Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product that connects consumers to merchants and brands. The key elements to our strategy are:
 ﻿

· | Exploit the competitive advantages and operating leverage of our technology platform. The core of our business is our proprietary “SmartReceipt” receipt intercept technology. Several years of development went into designing SmartReceipt such that the process of intercepting receipt data and controlling the receipt printer is scalable, portable to a wide variety of POS platforms, and does not impact the print speed of other performance characteristics of a typical receipt printer. Furthermore, we believe the transmission of receipt data to Mobivity’s cloud-based data stores presents a very competitive and innovative method of enabling POS data access. Additionally, we believe that our C4 SMS text messaging platform is more advanced than technologies offered by our competitors and provides us with a significant competitive advantage. With more than seven years of development, we believe that our C4 platform operates SMS text messaging transactions at a “least cost” relative to competitors while also being capable of supporting SMS text messaging transactional volume necessary to support our goal of several thousand end users. Additionally, our C4 platform supports interactive voice response, or, capabilities that we believe are unique to our solution and will allow Mobivity to deliver additional capabilities beyond SMS text messaging that will be unique and valuable to the marketplace. Our C4 platform also provides features that allow our customers to manage their Stampt mobile device application in conjunction with SMS text messaging campaigns, which we believe is a unique combination of both SMS text messaging and mobile device application management.

  ﻿

· | Evolve our sales and customer support infrastructure to uniquely serve very large customer implementations such as franchise-based brands who operate a large number of locations. Over the past few years we have focused our efforts on the development of our technology and solutions with the goal of selling and supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Going forward, we intend to increase significantly our investments in sales and customer support resources tailored to selling to customers that operate franchise brands.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We will continue to search and identify unique opportunities which we believe will enhance our product features and functionality, revenue goals, and technology. We intend to target companies with some or all of the following characteristics: (1) an established revenue base; (2) strong pipeline and growth prospects; -2- 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) break-even or positive cash flow; (4) opportunities for substantial expense reductions through integration into our platform; (5) strong sales teams; and (6) technology and services that further build out and differentiate our platform. Our acquisitions have historically been consummated through the issuance of a combination of our common stock and cash.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Build our intellectual property portfolio. We currently have five issued patents that we believe have significant potential application in the mobile marketing industry. We plan to continue our investment in building a strong intellectual property portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 While these are the key elements of our current strategy, there can be no guarantees that our strategy will not change or that our strategy will be successful.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 We have entered into the following material transactions since January 1, 2015.
 ﻿
 March 2015 Private Placement.  
 ﻿
 In March 2015, we conducted a private placement of 4,805,000 units of our securities at a price of $1.00 per unit.  Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase one-quarter share of our common stock, over a five year period, at an exercise price of $1.20 per share.  Emerging Growth Equities, Ltd. acted as placement agent for the private placement and received $234,500 in commissions and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 234,500 and 58,625 shares, exercisable over a period of five years from the closing date, at an exercise price of $1.00 and $1.20 per share, respectively.  Pursuant to the terms of the offering, we entered into registration rights agreement with the investors pursuant to which we filed with the SEC a resale registration statement covering the common shares made part of the units.  The SEC declared the registration statement effective on September 10, 2015.     ﻿
 LiveLenz Acquisition
 ﻿
 On January 15, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of LiveLenz Inc., a Nova Scotia corporation (“LiveLenz”), pursuant to an agreement dated January 15, 2016 among the Company and the stockholders of LiveLenz. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired all of the capital stock of LiveLenz in consideration of our issuance of 1,000,000 shares (“Consideration Shares”) of our common stock to the LiveLenz stockholders and our issuance of an additional 15,000 shares of our common stock in satisfaction of certain liabilities of LiveLenz. The agreement included customary representations, warranties, and covenants by us and the LiveLenz stockholders, including the LiveLenz stockholders’ agreement to indemnify us against certain claims or losses resulting from certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants by the LiveLenz stockholders in the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the LiveLenz stockholders have agreed to adjust the number of Consideration Shares downward based on LiveLenz’ working capital as of the closing and in the event of any claims for indemnification by us. The LiveLenz stockholders have agreed that 100% of the Consideration Shares will be escrowed for a period of 18 month and subject to forfeiture based on indemnification claims by us or the final determination of LiveLenz’ working capital as of the closing date. As of the date of this report, no adjustments have been made to the working capital.
 ﻿
 2016 Private Placement
 ﻿
 In March 2016, we conducted the private placement of 3,256,000 shares of our common stock, at a price of $0.60 per share, for the gross proceeds of $1,953,600.  The offering was conducted by our management and no commission or other selling fees were paid by us.  Pursuant to the terms of the offering, we entered into registration rights agreement with the investors pursuant to which we filed with the SEC a resale registration statement covering the common shares. The SEC declared the registration statement effective on August 8, 2016. 
 ﻿
 Working Capital Line of Credit Facility
 ﻿
 In March 2016, we entered into a Working Capital Line of Credit Facility (the “Facility”) with Silicon Valley Bank to provide up to $2 million to finance our general working capital needs.  The Facility is funded based on cash on deposit balances and advances against our accounts receivable based on customer invoicing.  Interest on Facility borrowings is calculated at rates between the prime rate minus 1.75% and prime rate plus 3.75% based on the borrowing base formula used at the time of borrowing.  The Facility contains standard events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations, breaches of affirmative or negative covenants, and bankruptcy.  There are no financial covenants and as of the date of this report there are borrowings of $1 million under the Facility.

2016 Warrant Exercise    ﻿    Between September 29 and October 31, 2016, we conducted an offer to the holders of our outstanding common stock purchase warrants pursuant to which our warrant holders were permitted to exercise their warrants at a reduced exercise price for a period expiring on October 31, 2016. At the commencement of the warrant offer, there were warrants outstanding that entitled their holders to purchase 8,464,339 shares of our common stock at exercise prices of $1.00 and $1.20 per share. The holders of all warrants were allowed to conduct cash-based exercises of their warrants at an exercise price of $0.70 per share up through October 31, 2016. We undertook this limited-time warrant exercise price reduction in order to raise additional capital without incurring further potential dilution to our stockholders. In addition, through the warrant holders’ acceptance of our offer, we could significantly reduce the number of outstanding warrants and thereby simplify our capital structure. As of the close of the warrant offer, there have been 3,329,990 warrants exercised to purchase 3,329,990 shares of our common stock, resulting in additional capital of $2,330,993. We recorded stock based compensation expense of $208,195 to account for the fair value of this transaction in accordance with ASC 718. The warrant offer was conducted by our management and there were no commissions paid by us in connection with the solicitation.  
 ﻿
 Industry Background
 ﻿
 We believe industry trends point to a shift in the local marketing industry in both how merchants and brands market their products and services to local customers. We believe that consumers are transitioning to new digital channels and moving away from legacy marketing channels. It is this transition that we believe has created an opportunity for new and innovative local marketing services and technologies to evolve. We believe that consumers are increasingly devoting their attention and lifestyle to mobile devices and that marketers will need new products, technologies, and services tailored for consumer’s mobile devices.
 ﻿
 Traditional marketing using television, radio and print lacks targeting and offline marketing audiences are declining annually based on research published by Forrester in a February 2015 study. Nielsen reports that television viewers in the key 18-49 year old age demographic are down in 2015, as are all television viewing households, and DVR usage has reduced television advertisement effectiveness by 30% over the past year. Radio listenership is down 15% from 2014 and 2015 radio advertising spend was down nearly 2% year over year. Yellow Pages use was down 22% in 2015 according to the Local Search Association findings and online news readers surpassed print for the first time in 2015. According to a Strategy Analytics Advertising Forecast in February of 2015, $124 billion is spent annually on traditional, offline marketing media sources that lack specific targeting and are declining in size and effectiveness.
 ﻿
 Mobile marketing campaigns use multiple channels to reach the consumer, including mobile web sites, mobile applications, mobile messaging and mobile video, all of which can be integrated into interactive campaigns. Each channel can link to additional mobile content or channels, as well as to complementing traditional media. Mobile marketing provides a powerful, instant and interactive response path in that consumers may send a keyword to a short code via SMS, or register on a mobile web site. This makes the mobile phone a precisely targeted communication channel, where users are highly engaged with content. As a result, the mobile channel is believed to be a highly effective campaign tool and its response levels are high compared to other media. We believe that mobile is valuable as a stand-alone medium for marketing, but it is also well suited for a vital role in fully integrated cross-media campaign plans, including TV, print, radio, outdoor, cinema, online and direct mail. We believe that the future of digital media will be significantly influenced by mobile phones where a direct, personal conversation can be had with the world’s largest network.

 The Mobivity Solution
 ﻿
 Our mobile marketing platform is designed to allow brands to operate mobile marketing campaigns, as well as resellers to market their own mobile marketing platform under their own brand identity. As of the date of this report, we have approximately 35,000 customers utilizing our mobile marketing platform and we deliver on their behalf an average of 38 million SMS text messages per month. We have approximately 30,000 additional customers using our Smart Receipt solution and we process on their behalf an average of 85 million receipt transactions per month. Our customers are spread over all industries that market to individual consumers and range in size from national franchisers to the single site family-owned business. Our clients access our “C4” solution through a standard Web browser that allows them to directly conduct the setup, messaging, and ongoing customer relationship management with the consumers they market to. Our customers are given a dedicated support representative along with account credentials to access their own C4 account from any Web browser.
 ﻿

· | Campaign Setup: Initially, our clients will use their own C4 account on our proprietary platform to design their mobile marketing campaign for purposes of attracting customers to subscribe for the customer’s mobile messaging service. In compliance with federal and state laws relating to mobile marketing, marketers typically attract customers to their mobile messaging service through media communications distributed through non-mobile devices, media, other than mobile devices, including store signage, billboards, other forms of print media, and digital media not directed through a mobile device. Our C4 solution also allows for the creation and design of digital display graphics that can be displayed on television screens, digital scoreboards, or other digital screens where an animated or more graphically rich solicitation may be desired. Digital displays are particularly useful on large digital scoreboard displays at sporting events. Through these various forms of -4-

communication, customers of our clients will be invited to subscribe to SMS text messaging communications (for example, “Join our mobile VIP club! Text “Pizza” to 12345”) or to set-up loyalty offers through our Stampt smartphone loyalty application (for example, “Download Stampt, use your iPhone or Android phone to join our loyalty program – buy five sandwiches and get one free!”).Consumers responding to these communications will be directed to our clients’ own C4 account on our proprietary platform, where our platform records and stores the consumer’s relevant information for access by our client stores. Once the consumer has subscribed to our customer’s mobile marketing campaign, our C4 solution serves as a tool by which our customers can initiate messages and other communications back to their subscribed consumers, as well as configure and administer their mobile marketing campaigns.

  ﻿

· | Messaging. Our C4 platform allows for marketers to instantly message their subscribers via SMS text messaging or “push” messaging to users of the Stampt smartphone application. Our platform is designed to be a fully automated, self-executing tool where our clients access their own C4 account on our proprietary platform, design and create their mobile marketing message, designate to whom among their list of opted-in consumers the message will be sent and then select the time (or times) the message will be distributed. Each customer is assigned a dedicated support representative to provide support in this process, however the platform is designed to provide the customer with the ability to design and carry-out the entire campaign through their remote online access to our platform. Our customers are provided with an instant communication channel to alert their subscribers of events, specials, or other announcements. Our C4 platform provides various messaging tools for marketers to create and initiate these messages in real-time or for future broadcasts. The solution also allows the marketer to connect to Facebook or Twitter accounts so that their messaging broadcasts can be promoted to select social media channels if desired.

  ﻿

· | Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Our C4 solution offers our customers a variety of CRM services, including the success rate for each media campaign designed to attract subscribers to the customer’s mobile marketing campaign, historical data and success rate with regard to each mobile message sent. The subscriber records and through various reporting features offered by the CRM function provide marketers with quick access to a variety of useful data points. Tracking subscriber and messaging activity over time is useful in handling customer inquiries or issues with the marketing program or to gain insights into subscriber behavior. For example, a marketer might want to examine how the total number of subscribers gained from a recent promotion of their call-to-action. The Mobivity solution provides various default reports while allowing for Mobivity customers to request custom reports tailored for their specific needs.

  ﻿

· | Stampt Smartphone Loyalty Application. Stampt is a smartphone application available to both iPhone and Android smartphones. The application is acquired by consumers via download from the Apple App Store or Google Play market service. Once installed, consumers can view local merchants who are setup on our C4 platform to offer mobile loyalty cards. Mobile loyalty cards allow consumers using Stampt to visit merchants and participate in loyalty programs (for example, “buy 10, get 1 free”) that are setup by merchants using the Mobivity solution. Consumers can also receive instant offers sent from merchants through our platform’s messaging features. The Stampt application allows consumers to register purchases by using the Stampt application on their smartphone to take a quick picture of a special code that the merchant provides at the time of purchase. The purchase is also registered on the merchant’s own account on our C4 platform. The Stampt application instantly verifies the consumer’s location at the related merchant’s location of business and registers the purchase. Purchases are then depicted on the Stampt application so the consumer and the merchant know how many purchases are required to earn a reward.

· | Smart Receipt. Our SmartReceipt solution enables our customers the ability to control the content on receipts printed from their point of sale, or POS system. SmartReceipt is a software application that is installed on the POS which dynamically controls what is printed on receipts such as coupons, announcements, or other calls-to-action such as invitations to participate in a survey. SmartReceipt includes a Web-based interface where users can design receipt content and implement business rules to dictate what receipt content is printed in particular situations. All receipt content is also transmitted to SmartReceipt’s server back-end for storage and analysis. Our C4 solution integrates with SmartReceipt by supporting SMS marketing or Stampt mobile application calls-to-action which can be printed on receipt content by SmartReceipt.

  ﻿

· | Resellers. Our platform can be white-labeled to allow for resellers or agents to market and deliver their own branded mobile marketing solution complete with all of the features of the C4 platform. Resellers are provisioned their own Web-based administration system whereby they can create and track their own customers’ use of the product.

  ﻿
 In the future, we intend to develop additional platform features that with the goal of driving additional value to the evolving mobile marketing industry.
 ﻿
 Marketing and Sales
 ﻿
 We market and sell the services offered over our proprietary C4 platform directly through our own sales force, via resellers, and in some cases through agents.

﻿

· | Direct Sales. Our direct sales force is predominantly comprised of five sales representatives employed by us to promote and sell our services in various geographical areas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Resellers. We sell our services via wholesale pricing of licensing and transactional fees to various resellers who market and sell the Mobivity services under their own brand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Agents. We also engage independent agents to market and sell our services under the Mobivity brand in return for payment of a commission or revenue share for customers they introduce to us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | In addition to our direct and indirect sales channels, we also market our services online through our Website, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other online channels. We also participate in various trade and industry events to build awareness and promote exposure to our services and brand.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our services are predominantly marketed and sold in the form of a recurring software licensing fee that is determined by desired features and the number of physical locations our customers would like to deploy the services in. For example, a customer who exclusively utilizes our SMS text messaging feature for one location will pay a much lower recurring licensing fee that a marketer who desires our full breadth of product features and needs to drive localized marketing campaigns across 50 locations in various cities or locales.
 ﻿
 In addition to license fees, we also arrange for a transaction fee in special cases where our customers require greater bandwidth or throughput to process large volumes of mobile messaging transactions. For example, a customer may want to utilize our services for a major sporting event when there may be tens of thousands of fans who are expecting a “score alert” sent to their mobile phone via a SMS text message. In this case, the required resources to facilitate a large number of SMS messages in a short period of time is much higher and therefore we may charge an additional per-SMS text message fee to our customer.
 ﻿
 Research and Development
 ﻿
 We have developed an internal and external software development team with many years of experience in the mobile advertising and marketing industries. Our research and development activities are focused on enhancements to our platform, including extending our technology into payment processing, location based services, application analytics, and other technical opportunities in the evolving mobile industry.
 ﻿
 Our total engineering, research and development expenditures in 2016 and 2015 were $1,712,750 and $728,741, respectively.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 Although the market for mobile marketing software and solutions is relatively new, it is very competitive. We compete with companies of all sizes in select geographies that offer solutions that compete with various elements of our platform and offering, such as SMS text messaging service providers or providers of mobile smartphone applications. We also compete at times with interactive and traditional advertising agencies that perform mobile marketing as part of their services to their customers. Many of these entities have significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, we compete with traditional offline coupon and discount services, as well as television, radio, newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon and discount products and services to their retail enterprise customers.
 ﻿
 Many of the leading providers of online services have begun to develop or acquire mobile marketing platforms with features similar to ours. For example, in May 2010, Google, Inc. acquired Admob, Inc. and in January 2010 Apple, Inc. acquired Quattro Wireless. Each of the acquired companies was engaged in mobile marketing. In addition, we believe that Facebook, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo! have each begun to develop mobile marketing platforms.
 ﻿
 We believe that the key competitive factors that differentiate us from our competitors include:
 ﻿

· | Demonstrable experience and competence. We have been providing mobile marketing services since 2006. In 2009, Sybase, an international enterprise software and services company, awarded us their Innovator of the Year. Major brands such as Sonic, Subway, Chick-Fil-A, and Baskin Robbins have selected Mobivity’s products and services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Competitive pricing. We believe we are one of the few mobile marketing providers in the industry that can provide SMS text messaging services at a flat licensing fee structure rather than charging for every SMS text message transaction processed. We also believe that we have a “least cost” operating advantage that competitors may find challenging to compete with.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Scalability. We believe that our platform is more scalable than most if not all of our competitors. Many of our customers require large volumes of mobile marketing messages to be transacted and a high quantity of end users operating our Web- -6- 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


based product features. We have grown our monthly messaging volume from less than 1 million SMS text messages per month in 2010 to more than 38 million per month as of the date of this report. The number of customers utilizing our Web-based products has also grown from less than 100 in 2010 to more than 35,000 as of the date of this report.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Our business, as is typical of companies in our industry, is highly seasonal. This is primarily due to traditional marketing and advertising spending being heaviest during the holiday season while brands, advertising agencies, mobile operators and media companies often close out annual budgets towards the end of the calendar year. Seasonal trends have historically contributed to, and we anticipate will continue to contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 We regard the protection of our developed technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trademark laws, copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology which is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.
 ﻿
 As of the date of this report we own seven patents. U.S. Patent numbers 7,991,388 B1 and 8,244,216 B1 were issued on August 2, 2011 and August 14, 2012, respectively. These patents cover a geo-bio-metric personal identification number, a service that authenticates a user from a feature phone or smart phone using a number of mobile attainable attributes: geolocation, facial image, accelerometer (which measures the physical orientation or movement of the device itself), and text messaging. The purpose of the geo-bio-metric PIN service is to authenticate a user while verifying the following: the user is currently using his or her other phone; the user is at the location that their phone is at; the user is not at another location and using their phone through a proxy; and an impostor is not using the phone.

 In March 2011, we acquired US Patent number 6,788,769 B1 which covers a method and system for using telephone numbers as a key to address email and online content without the use of a look-up database. Using this system, a phone number is used to access a website or an email address in exactly the same way it is used to dial a telephone.
 ﻿
 U.S. Patent numbers 8,463,306 and 8,818,434 were issued on June 11, 2013 and August 26, 2014, respectively. U.S. Patent 9,307,430 was issued on April 5, 2016. These patents cover a method and system for testing a SMS text messaging network. The method and system allows for real-time testing of the initiation and completion of SMS text messages and any delivery delays across the major American mobile phone carriers, and accurately measures the progress on SMS broadcasts and records when a broadcast has been completed.
 ﻿
 U.S Patent number 3,836,444 was granted on September 29,2016. This patent covers a system to generate value added messages on receipts printed by point-of-sale (POS) systems based on various rules determined by information conveyed on the purchase receipt such as location, time of day, or other purchase data. The patent application claims priority to a patent application filed in 2006.
 ﻿
 Our issued and any future patents that we may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. The failure of our patents, or the failure of our copyright and trade secret laws to adequately protect our technology, might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. In addition, patents may not issue from any of our current or any future applications.

 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 The growth and development of the mobile messaging market and the market for electronic storage of personal information has resulted in a variety of stringent consumer protection laws, many of which impose significant burdens on companies that store personal information. Depending on the products and services that they offer, mobile data service providers may be subject to regulations and laws applicable to providers of mobile, Internet and VOIP services, including domestic and international laws and regulations relating to user privacy and data protection, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, billing, real estate, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile, television and intellectual property ownership and infringement. We expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation. In addition, the

application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled.
 ﻿
 In addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has examined, or is currently examining, how and when consumers enroll in mobile services, what types of disclosures consumers receive, what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers' personal information. Consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained, used and shared with other companies. Consumer groups have asked the FTC to: identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used; investigate marketing tactics that target children; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest, in particular, in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information.
 ﻿
 The principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform, include:
 ﻿

· | Deceptive Trade Practice Law in the U.S. The FTC and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising. The general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be "clearly and conspicuously" disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision. The balancing of the desire to capture a potential customer's attention, while providing adequate disclosure, can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures.

· | Behavioral Advertising. Behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. Behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individual's web-browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual. This data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geo-tags through mobile devices. Many businesses adhere to industry self-governing principles, including an opt-out regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected. The FTC and EU member states are considering regulations in this area, which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. Among other things, the implementation of an opt-in regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services. A few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state. These bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer. There have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising.

· | Behavioral Advertising-Privacy Regulation. Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state, as well as EU member state and foreign country, laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual, such as an Internet Protocol address or a name. Although the mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely self-regulated in the U.S., the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual. Within the EU, member state data protection authorities typically regard IP addresses as personal information, and legislation adopted recently in the EU requires consent for the placement of a cookie on a user device. In addition, EU data protection authorities are following with interest the FTC's discussions regarding behavioral advertising and may follow suit by imposing additional privacy requirements for mobile advertising practices.

  ﻿

· | Marketing-Privacy Regulation. In addition, there are U.S. federal and state laws and EU member state and other country laws that govern SMS and telecommunications-based marketing, generally requiring senders to transmit messages (including those sent to mobile devices) only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages. U.S. federal, EU member state and other country laws also govern e-mail marketing, generally imposing an opt-out requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship.

· | SMS and Location-Based Marketing Best Practices and Guidelines. We voluntarily comply with the guidelines of the Mobile Marketing Association, or MMA, a global association of 700 agencies, advertisers, mobile device manufacturers, wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel. The MMA has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities. The guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service. We voluntarily comply with the MMA code of conduct, which generally require notice and user consent for delivery -8-

of location-based services. In addition, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, or CTIA, has developed Best Practices and Guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding location-based services.

  ﻿

· | TCPA. The United States Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephone-dialing system (ATDS) unless the recipient has given prior consent. The statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national Do-Not-Call list, and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent. Violations of the TCPA can result in statutory damages of $500 per violation (i.e., for each individual text message). U.S. state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls. We believe that our platform does not employ an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA based on case law construing that term.

  ﻿

· | CAN-SPAM. The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN SPAM Act, prohibits all commercial e-mail messages, as defined in the law, to mobile phones unless the device owner has given "express prior authorization." Recipients of such messages must also be allowed to opt-out of receiving future messages the same way they opted-in. Senders have ten business days to honor opt-out requests. The FCC has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial e-mail messages. Senders have 30 days from the date the domain name is posted on the FCC site to stop sending unauthorized commercial e-mail to addresses containing the domain name. Violators are subject to fines of up to $6.0 million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities. Carriers, the FTC, the FCC, and State Attorneys General may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the Act.

  ﻿

· | Communications Privacy Acts. Foreign and U.S. federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage. EU member state laws also require consent for our receiving this information, and if our carrier customers fail to obtain such consent we could be subjected to civil or even criminal penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Security Breach Notification Requirements. EU member state laws require notice to the member state data protection authority of a data security breach involving personal data if the breach poses a risk to individuals. In addition, Germany enacted a broad requirement to notify individuals in the event of a data security breach that is likely to be followed by notification requirements to data subjects in other EU member states. In the U.S., various states have enacted data breach notification laws, which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information. Japan and Uruguay have also enacted security breach notice requirements. This new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including by the U.S. at the federal level, as well.

  ﻿

· | Children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children. Other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information. In addition, it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose.
