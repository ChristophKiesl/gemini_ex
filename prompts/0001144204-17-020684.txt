ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Original Source Entertainment, Inc. (the “Company”, the “registrant”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or “Original Source”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. We originally formed to license songs to the television and movie industry. From our inception we have generated very little revenues, and our operations have been primarily limited to organizational, start-up, and capital formation activities. We have historically and currently have no employees other than our officers.
 
On February 5, 2014, our board of directors authorized the spin-off of Original Source Music, Inc. (“Original Source Music”), our wholly-owned subsidiary which then held all of our operations and assets, to our shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. Under the terms of the spin-off, the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Original Source Music will be distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of our common stock on the February 25, 2014 record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of our common stock as of the February 25, 2014 record date will become owners of 100% of the common stock of Original Source Music. The spin-off of Original Source Music was effective as of May 13, 2016, due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Registration Statement on Form 10 of Original Source Music and the Form 10’s effectiveness.
 
We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. We have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has the Company been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. We believe that we are a blank check company as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, because as of May 13, 2016, we ceased having a specific business plan and purpose when we spun-off our then wholly owned subsidiary Original Source Music, which held all of operations and assets, as further described above.
 
We do not have any definitive plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any operating business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. However, we are currently in negotiations with NeuroOne, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroOne”), with respect to a potential reorganization pursuant to which, as currently contemplated, we would acquire NeuroOne as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the stockholders of NeuroOne would exchange all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NeuroOne currently held by them for shares of the Company’ Common Stock (the “Proposed Transaction”). As the definitive agreement and other transaction documents are still being negotiated, and the parties are still performing due diligence, we can give no assurance as to the ultimate form or terms of the Proposed Transaction or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated at all.
