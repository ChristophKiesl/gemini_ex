Item 1. Description of Business
 
We are a development-stage company, incorporated on January 29, 2018 in the state of Nevada, with a fiscal year end of December 31. We are intending to develop, market and sell a subscription-based income/expense tracking application service. The management is also discussing providing a secure physical wallet that only opens once an expenditure/earning is reflected in the application. Our operations have been limited to researching the marketplace for our proposed income/expense application product possibly connected to a physical wallet and the issues entailed in developing these products, as well as the preliminary design and development of our website. We have not yet implemented our business model or undertaken development of our proposed income/expense product nor the possible physical wallet. To date, we have generated no revenues from our operations. There can be no assurances that our efforts to develop our proposed income/expense service will succeed, or that we will be able to market our proposed income/expense service or the potential physical wallet, if developed.

Why physical wallet?
 In future, once we start generating revenues, we plan on developing a physical wallet with a lock on it. The lock will open via Bluetooth at a moment a user makes an entry to the application. That way we will exclude a chance for an expense or an income occur and stay unrecorded, thus, significantly increasing the efficiency of the users budget planning and monitoring of their monies. The scope of the project is huge, and we expect it to take at least 12 months to be completed.

Monetization of the project:
 We plan on providing one-month free trial for users to look-and-feel its usage comfort and enjoy its design. After that, users will be offered to purchase in-app subscriptions for 6/12/24 months. They will be able to pay simply using a credit/debit card that has been previously linked to the App.

Further, when the business is successful and as the physical wallets are developed, they will be available for sale on our website or purchased through the App. 

The wallets will be delivered to their new owners with a promo-code of one-year App subscription.

Monetization from in-app advertisements will also be one of our income sources. We also maintain website at lovarra.com
 
Employees and Employment Agreements
 
We have no employees other than Vadim Rata, our president and director, and Nicolai Moldovanu, our secretary, treasurer and director. Neither Mr. Rata nor Mr. Moldovanu is employed elsewhere so they have the flexibility and willingness to devote all of their time to working on our company and are not paid a salary or compensation. 
 
We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our directors for time spent as directors.
