Overview


We operate in three primary business areas: first, application of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our precision medicine business, to provide AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients and to assist pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries in the development of new personalized drugs and diagnostics; second, production of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-cleared STREAMWAY® System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal and associated products and; third, contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production.


We have three reportable segments: Helomics, Skyline, and Soluble. The Helomics segment includes clinical testing and contract research services that include the application of AI. Our Soluble segment provides services using a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens, using additives and excipients commonly included in protein formulations resulting in soluble and physically stable formulations for biologics. Our Skyline segment consists of the STREAMWAY System product sales, and our TumorGenesis® subsidiary is included within corporate. Going forward, we have determined that we will focus our resources on the Helomics segment and our primary mission of applying AI to precision medicine and drug discovery.
 
During the third quarter of 2020, there was a change in our reportable segments. As a result of the formation of the new Soluble subsidiary, we believe the Soluble business represents a reportable segment. Soluble signed its first contract during the third quarter of 2020. We also believe it is appropriate to combine our Skyline Medical and Skyline Europe entities into a single reportable segment based on the changes to our physical presence and intent to sign future contracts through the US entity. Finally, we believe the Helomics business continues to be a reportable segment of the business.


Precision Medicine Business


Our precision medicine business, conducted in our Helomics division, is committed to improving the effectiveness of cancer therapy using our proprietary, multi-omic tumor profiling platform, one-of-a-kind database of historical tumor data, and the power of AI to build predictive models of tumor drug response.

Helomics’ mission is to improve clinical outcomes for patients by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. Our Patient-centric Drug Discovery using Active Learning asset (PeDAL™) is a unique technology that combines our proprietary, clinically validated patient tumor cell line assay (TruTumor™), a vast knowledgebase of proprietary and public data together (TumorSpace™) with active learning - the active learning allowing the efficient exploration of compound drug responses against a large diverse patient “space”. PeDAL offers researchers the opportunity to efficiently and cost-effectively bring patient diversity much earlier in the drug discovery process. PeDAL works by iterative cycles of active-learning powered Learn-Predict-Test (L-P-T) to guide the testing of patient-specific compound responses using the TruTumor assay and patient cell lines to build a comprehensive predictive model of patient responses to compounds. This predictive model can then be used to rank compounds by the fraction of patients of certain profiles that respond as well as the set of compounds that provide the best coverage across patients. PeDAL will be used in fee-for-service projects with pharmaceutical companies.
 
Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) and AI-Driven Business


We believe leveraging our unique, historical database of the drug responses of over 150,000 patient tumors to build AI and data-driven multi-omic predictive models of tumor drug response and outcome will provide actionable insights critical to both new drug development and individualizing patient treatment. Through the course of over 15 years of clinical testing of the responses of patient tumors to drugs, Helomics has amassed a huge proprietary knowledgebase of 150,000 patient cases. This data has been rigorously de-identified and aggregated to build a unique, proprietary model of tumor drug response that we call TumorSpace. The TumorSpace model and its data provide a priori knowledge for the machine learning approaches we employ as part of the PeDAL approach.
 
TumorSpace model provides a significant competitive advantage to our business offerings. PeDAL's unique patient and tumor-centric AI-driven approach can rapidly and cost-effectively screen hundreds of compounds in thousands of tumor cell lines, and gain valuable information about off-target effects and deliver:
 

• | A ranked list of drug candidates by responsiveness 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Sets of drug candidates that provide maximum patient coverage 
• | Biomarker profiles of patients that respond to specific drug candidates



PeDAL also can deliver drug candidates targeted at a specific patient profile as early as the hit-to-lead stage of discovery, significantly increasing the chance of clinical success, leading to a dramatic improvement in both the success, time, and cost of your oncology discovery programs. The AI-driven models will, once validated, also provide clinical decision support to help oncologists individualize treatment.
 
Our CRO/AI business leverages our core competence in profiling the drug response of patient tumors. Our large knowledgebase of tumor drug response and other data, together with proven AI, has created a unique capability for oncology drug discovery that allows for the highly efficient screening of drug responses from thousands of diverse, well-characterized patient primary tumor cell lines. This novel disruptive patient-centric approach is ideally suited to the early part of drug discovery (especially hit-to-lead, lead optimization, and pre-clinical), resulting in better prioritization of compounds and better coverage of patient diversity. This will dramatically improve the chances of successfully translating discoveries, resulting in lowered costs, shortened timelines, and most importantly enhanced “speed-to-patient” for new therapies.
 
Our CRO services business applies PeDAL to address a range of needs from discovery through clinical and translational research, to clinical trials and diagnostic development and validation as noted below:
 
Research
 

• | Biomarker discovery
--+--------------------
• | Drug discovery 
• | Drug-repurposing 

Development
 

• | Patient enrichment & selection for trials
--+------------------------------------------
• | Clinical trial optimization 
• | Adaptive trials 

Clinical Decision Support
 

• | Patient stratification
--+-----------------------
• | Treatment selection

We believe this market segment has significant growth potential and we believe we are differentiated from traditional CRO’s and other precision medicine and AI companies through these unique assets:



• | Clinically validated TruTumor platform; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | TumorSpace model of over 150,000 tumor cases; 
• | Experienced AI team and AI platform; 
• | Ability to access outcome data going back over ten years for over 120,000 of the tumor cases in our database.

Industry and Market Background and Analysis – Precision Medicine Business
 
Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that considers individual variability in genes, disease, environment, and lifestyle for each case to develop effective therapies. This approach allows doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment, dose, and therapeutic regimen could provide the best possible outcome. The global precision medicine market is estimated to reach $278.6 billion by 2030, up from $43.6 billion in 2016. (Source: BIS Research’s “Global Precision Medicine Market to Reach $278.6 Billion by 2030”, December 2030).
 
Precision medicine, precisely targeting drugs based on the genomic profile of the patient, has become the aspiration for cancer therapy. Over the past several decades, researchers have identified molecular patterns that are useful in defining the prognosis of a given cancer, determining the appropriate treatments, and designing targeted treatments to address specific molecular alterations. The objective of this precision oncology is to develop treatments tailored to the genetic changes in each person’s cancer, intended to improve the effectiveness of the therapeutic regimen, and minimize the treatment’s effects on healthy cells. However, for a majority of patients the reality is that while many mutations in the patient’s tumor can be identified most are not actionable with current protocols, due to a lack of research regarding which mutations in a tumor confer a sensitivity to a particular drug. As a result, the impact of targeted therapies is low, and uptake in clinical practice is inconsistent.
 
There is now a growing realization that genomics alone will not be enough to achieve the promise of personalized therapeutics, especially for cancer. A multi-omic approach (e.g., assessing the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, responseome, and microbiome) provides researchers and clinicians the comprehensive information necessary for new drug development and individualized therapy. Comparatively, the multi-omic approach provides a three-dimensional, 360-degree view of the cancer, while genomics alone is just a flat, one-dimensional view. However, multi-omic data is difficult to access quickly as it is both costly and time consuming to initiate prospective data collection, and few comprehensive, multi-omic datasets exist, especially specific to cancer. Our Helomics TumorSpace database addresses this need.
 
Clinical Testing


Via our Helomics subsidiary, we offer a group of clinically relevant, cancer-related tumor profiling and biomarker tests for gynecological cancers that determine how likely the patient is to respond to various types of chemotherapy and which therapies might be indicated by relevant tumor biomarkers.


Clinical testing is comprised of Tumor Drug Response Testing (formerly ChemoFx) and Genomic Profiling (formerly BioSpeciFx) tests. The Tumor Drug Response Testing determines how a patient’s tumor specimen responds to a panel of various chemotherapy drugs, while the Genomic Profiling evaluates the expression of specific genes, or biomarkers, in the patient’s tumor. Our proprietary TruTumor tumor platform provides us with the ability to work with actual live tumor cells to study the unique biology of the patient’s tumor in order to understand how the patient responds to treatment.


Testing involves obtaining tumor tissue during biopsy or surgery which is then sent to our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified laboratory using a special collection kit. Tumor Drug Response Testing is a fresh tissue platform that uses the patient’s own live tumor cells to help physicians identify effective treatment options for each gynecologic cancer patient.

Genomic Profiling offers a select group of clinically relevant protein expression and genetic mutation tests associated with drug response and disease prognosis. Physicians can select biomarkers for testing from carefully chosen panels of relevant tests, intuitively organized by cancer pathway and tumor type. Results for these tests are presented in a clear, easy to understand format, including summaries of the clinical relevance of each marker.
 
Business Strategy for Precision Medicine Business


We are a data and AI-driven discovery services company that provides AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients by leveraging our two primary unique assets:

· | TruTumor - a clinically validated tumor-profiling platform that can generate drug response profiles and other multi-omic data. Over $200 million has been invested in this platform and was clinically validated in ovarian cancer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | TumorSpace model contains data on the drug response profiles across 131 cancer types over 10+ years of clinical testing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Over 38,000 of the more than 150,000 clinically validated cases in our TumorSpace database are specific to ovarian cancer. The data in TumorSpace is highly differentiated, having both drug response data, biomarkers, and access to historical outcome data from those patient samples. We intend to generate additional data (genomics and transcriptomics) from these tumor samples to deliver a multi-omic approach to the pharmaceutical industry.
 
Through our Helomics subsidiary, we will utilize both this historical data and the TumorSpace platform to build AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response and outcome through our CancerQuest 2020 (“CCQ2020”) initiative. Once validated, we will commercialize these AI-driven predictive models in revenue generating service projects with pharmaceutical, biotech, and diagnostic companies.
 
A key part of our commercialization strategy for the CCQ2020 initiative is the understanding that our AI-driven models of tumor drug response serve a key unmet need of pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries for actionable multi-omic insights on cancer. In collaboration with these companies, using the predictive models, we will accelerate the search for more individualized and effective cancer treatments, through revenue generating projects in biomarker discovery, drug screening, drug repurposing, and clinical trials.
 
Our commercial strategy has identified a portfolio of revenue generating project types that leverage the predictive models, our AI expertise, PeDAL tumor profiling, and CLIA laboratory to provide custom solutions utilizing our full array of assets and expertise.
 
The CCQ2020 initiative focused initially on ovarian cancer, which is where we have the most expertise, samples, data, and access to outcomes. However, we intend to expand the initiative to include cancers of the lung, breast, colon, and prostate, and will actively seek partners to assist in that effort.
 
Within the clinical sector, we will utilize these predictive models (once validated) for new clinical decision support tools for individualizing therapy for patients with cancer. These clinical decision support tools are a longer revenue horizon than the fee-for-service research projects with pharmaceutical companies but, importantly, will provide a steady stream of additional data generation to refine the predictive models for both clinical and research applications.
 
Soluble Biotech
 
Our subsidiary, Soluble Biotech Inc. (“Soluble”), focuses on contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production and operates the assets of Soluble Therapeutics and BioDtech, which the Company acquired in May 2020. Specifically, Soluble provides optimized FDA-approved formulations for vaccines, antibodies, and other protein therapeutics in a faster and lower cost basis to its customers. In addition, Soluble enables protein degradation studies, which is a new and, based on current projections, potentially substantial line of business for the Company.

-

 

The primary assets of Soluble are our automated High Throughput Self-Interaction Chromatography (HSC™). HSC is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on FDA approved excipients for protein formulations. Our technology measures second virial coefficient (B22 value) of protein-protein interactions to identify excipients that promote protein solubility in solutions. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic. For academic collaborators, this means further progression of biochemical & biology studies necessary to advance fundamental research in areas of unmet medical need.
 
In addition, Soluble provides comprehensive protein stability analysis. Analysis via time-dependent shelf-life studies and forced degradation studies designed to quickly determine which of the FDA approved additives that will improve the solubility and stability of proteins in solutions. Services include pre-formulation development, formulation stability assessment, and biophysical characterization which evaluate variables including pH, temperature, humidity, light, oxidizing agents, and mechanical stress to determine the most promising additives, formulation of B22 values and confirmation on conformation stability. We provide clients with a list of the most promising additives from a set of over 40 different additives that can increase the solubility and stability of protein formulations.
 
Soluble also offers protein solubility kits that allow rapid identification of soluble formulations. We provide four different kits to fulfill customer solubility requirements. The kits are in 96-well format and provide the tools and methods to compare relative solubility across 88 common formulations (with 8 controls). Soluble kits utilize a simple mix and spin protocol that quickly evaluates aggregation behavior as a function of pH, salt, and additives costing significantly less than if manually determined. In addition, we provide innovative technologies for bacterial detection and removal in therapeutic proteins that continue to be a significant issue in the pharmaceutical field.
 
Skyline Medical – The STREAMWAY System


Sold through our subsidiary, Skyline Medical Inc. (“Skyline Medical”), the STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid, and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present both an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical’s STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the United States.


Skyline Medical operated with reduced personnel and associated operating costs in 2020. By streamlining our production, the Company maximized efficiency attaining similar revenue to 2019. Throughout the year we continued to receive indications of interest from several parties for the possible acquisition of the Skyline division, as well as other partnership initiatives. We continue to operate the Skyline Medical business by continually improving our strategic opportunities, while focusing our resources on our precision medicine business.
 
Industry and Market Background and Analysis - Infectious and Biohazardous Waste Management
 
There has long been recognition of the collective potential for ill effects to healthcare workers from exposure to infectious/biohazardous materials. Federal and state regulatory agencies have issued mandatory guidelines for the control of such materials, and in particular, bloodborne pathogens. OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) requires employers to adopt engineering and work practice controls that would eliminate or minimize employee exposure from hazards associated with bloodborne pathogens. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The revised standard clarifies and emphasizes the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The revised standard also calls for the use of “automated controls” as it pertains to the minimization of healthcare exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

Most surgical procedures produce potentially infectious materials that must be disposed with the lowest possible risk of cross-contamination to healthcare workers. Current standards of care allow for these fluids to be retained in canisters and located in the operating room where they can be monitored throughout the surgical procedure. Once the procedure is complete these canisters and their contents are disposed using a variety of methods, all of which include manual handling and result in a heightened risk to healthcare workers for exposure to their contents. Canisters are the most prevalent means of collecting and disposing of infectious fluids in hospitals today. Traditional, non-powered canisters and related suction and fluid disposable products are exempt and do not require FDA clearance. 
 
We believe that our virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology (1) significantly reduces the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (2) further reduces the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (3) reduces the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (4) enhances the surgical team’s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient’s status during and after procedures. In addition to the traditional canister method of waste fluid disposal, several other powered medical devices have been developed that address some of the deficiencies described above. Most of these competing products continue to utilize some variation on the existing canister technology, and while not directly addressing the canister, most have been successful in eliminating the need for an expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.  Our existing competitors with products already on the market have a clear competitive advantage over us in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, many of our competitors have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an emerging growth company like ours.
 
We expect the hospital surgery market to continue to increase due to population growth, the aging of the population, and expansion of surgical procedures to new areas (for example, use of the endoscope) which requires more fluid management and new medical technology.
 
STREAMWAY System Product Sales


Our Skyline Medical division consists primarily of sales of the STREAMWAY System, as well as sales of the proprietary cleaning fluid and filters for use with the STREAMWAY System. We manufacture an environmentally conscious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids resulting from surgical and other medical procedures. We have been granted patents for the STREAMWAY System in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We distribute our products to medical facilities where bodily and irrigation fluids produced during medical procedures must be contained, measured, documented, and disposed. Our products minimize the exposure potential to the healthcare workers who handle such fluids.


The STREAMWAY System is a wall-mounted fully automated system that disposes of an unlimited amount of suction fluid providing uninterrupted performance for physicians while virtually eliminating healthcare workers’ exposure to potentially infectious fluids collected during surgical and other patient procedures. We also manufacture and sell two disposable products required for the operation of the STREAMWAY System: a bifurcated dual port procedure filter with tissue trap and a single use bottle of cleaning solution. Both items are utilized on a single procedure basis and must be discarded after use. The STREAMWAY disposables are a critical component of our business model. Recurring revenues from the sale of the disposables are expected to be significantly higher over time than the revenues from the initial sale of the unit. We have exclusive distribution rights to the disposable solution.


TumorGenesis


Our subsidiary, TumorGenesis, is pursuing a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. We have also announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients).

Competition and Competitive Advantages
 
Precision Medicine Business. We presently have clinical information, including tumor drug response data and an in-house bioinformatics AI platform. Cancer treatments require at least 5 years of testing to see progression-free survival rates. While competitors must wait for this data, we can leverage that data today. Other companies within our market segment are spending significant investment dollars to generate this data which they cannot leverage until the future. We can leverage the data today by sequencing the tumors and gathering the outcome data which is measured in months instead of years. In addition, the following points detail the key differentiators in our model building approach.

• | Models are built with real world data on how patient tumors responded to drugs, together with clinical outcome (progression-free survival/overall survival).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe this patient-centric, highly standardized, and curated, multi-omic tumor model offers a better chance of generating serviceable predictive models of drug-response and outcomes than competitive approaches in the market today. The information embodied in the AI-driven predictive model provides insights into each tumor’s response to different therapeutic options, resulting in the ability to provide actionable insights critical to both new drug development and individualizing patient treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soluble. HSC Technology is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on FDA approved excipients for protein formulations. The HSC Instrument and its technology has been validated over the past twelve years via industry and academic collaborations. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic.
Skyline Medical. We further believe that the STREAMWAY System is unique to the industry in that it not only allows continuous suction but also provides for unlimited capacity, eliminating the need to interrupt a procedure to change canisters. To our knowledge, the STREAMWAY System is the only known fully automated direct-to-drain system that is wall-mounted and able to collect, measure, and dispose of an unlimited amount of waste fluid without interruption.
Suppliers
 
We buy our raw materials from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of any one supplier would not materially adversely affect our business. We currently have a single supplier for certain materials and reagents that our Helomics subsidiary uses to perform its molecular diagnostic tests. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain that these strategies will be effective or that the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If our current suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, there could be an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing. In the event of the loss of these suppliers, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business. We have existing and good relationships with our service vendors.
 
Research and Development (“R&D”)


We spent $372,710 and $422,964 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, on R&D.

Intellectual Property


We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret intellectual property rights, and other measures to protect our intellectual property to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies if a breach were to occur.
Skyline Medical. In general, our patents are directed to a system and method for collecting waste fluid from a surgical procedure while ensuring there is no interruption of suction during the surgical procedure and no limit on the volume of waste fluid that can be collected. We hold the following granted patents in the United States, and a pending application in the United States on our earlier STREAMWAY System models: US7469727, US8123731, and US Publication No. US20090216205 (collectively, the “Patents”). The Patents will begin to expire on August 8, 2023.


On January 25, 2014, we filed a non-provisional Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) Application No. PCT/US2014/013081 claiming priority from the U.S. Provisional Patent Application, number 61756763 which was filed on January 25, 2013. The PCT allows an applicant to file a single patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the 148-member countries of the PCT, including the United States. The United States Patent Office has assigned application #14/763,459 to our previously filed PCT application.


As of November 22, 2017, we were informed that the European Patent Office allowed all our claims for application #14743665.3-1651 and on as of July 11, 2018, we were informed that the European Patent #EP2948200 was granted and published validating in the following countries: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Our PCT patent application is for an enhanced model of the surgical fluid waste management system. We utilize this enhanced technology in the updated version of the STREAMWAY System unit we began selling in 2014.


Government Regulation


Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including some specific to our business, some specific to our industry, and others relating to conducting business generally (e.g., U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. The table below highlights key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses:

CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Licensing | CLIA regulates the operations of virtually all clinical laboratories, requiring that they be certified by the federal government and that they comply with various technical, operational, personnel, and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable, and timely. State laws may require additional personnel qualifications or licenses, quality control, record maintenance, proficiency testing, or detailed review of our scientific method validations and technical procedures for certain tests. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal or state healthcare programs.

Medicare and Medicaid; Fraud and Abuse | Diagnostic testing services provided under Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to complex, evolving, stringent, and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws, and regulations, including those relating to billing, coverage, and reimbursement. Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid, or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have an ownership or investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the testing laboratory, unless specific exceptions are met. Federal substance abuse legislation enacted in 2018 contains anti-kickback provisions that are, by their terms, applicable to laboratory testing paid for by all payers. Upon full review of the legislation, we were in compliance at that time and continue to maintain compliance. We monitor regularly and reflect this in our annual compliance report. Some states have similar laws that are not limited in applicability to only Medicare and Medicaid referrals and could also affect tests that are paid for by health plans and other non-governmental payers. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal or state healthcare programs.

A healthcare provider may be subject to penalties for non-compliance and may be required to notify individuals or state, federal, or county governments if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information. 

 
To date, no regulatory agency has established exclusive jurisdiction over the area of biohazardous and infectious waste in healthcare facilities.


FDA Clearance under Section 510(k)


The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health requires 510(k) submitters to provide information that compares its new device to a marketed device of a similar type, in order to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent.



13
--

 

We filed the 510(k) submission for clearance of the STREAMWAY System device on March 14, 2009 and received written confirmation on April 1, 2009 that our 510(k) has been cleared by the FDA.


Following this 510(k) clearance by the FDA, we continue to be subject to the normal ongoing audits and reviews by the FDA and other governing agencies. These audits and reviews are standard and typical in the medical device industry, and we do not anticipate being affected by any extraordinary guidelines or regulations.
 
Our subsidiary, Skyline Medical has successfully passed FDA audits in the past, with no observations or 483 warning letters issued.


Application for Electrical Safety Testing and Certification


We sought and achieved testing and certification to the IEC 60606-1 and IEC 60606-1-2, two internationally recognized standards.


The 60601-1 3rd edition certification for our STREAMWAY System is valid and enables us to continue to market and sell our product domestically and internationally.


We have contracted with TUV, a nationally recognized testing laboratory-NRTL, to certify our STREAMWAY System to the new 60601-1 3rd Edition in late 2016. We attained certification to the new standard, and then submitted it to our Notified Body (BSI) for recommendation for our CE Mark, which we received in June 2017, allowing us to sell products outside of the United States.


Effective November 21, 2016, we received a Medical Device Establishment License to sell the STREAMWAY System and related disposables in Canada.
