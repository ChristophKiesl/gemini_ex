Our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to create next-generation robotic platforms. We believe that this approach accelerates the time to market, while also reducing the costs and risks associated with product development. These capabilities are amplified by the integration of artificial intelligence, home understanding and machine vision technologies that further improve cleaning performance and help personalize the cleaning experience, enabling customers to have greater control over where, when and how our robots clean. We believe that our significant expertise in robot design, engineering, and smart home technologies and targeted focus on understanding and addressing consumer needs, positions us well to capitalize on the anticipated growth in the market for robot-based consumer products. 
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") to be a global pandemic, COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic disruption, and governments around the world have implemented various measures, including travel restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, border closures, and social distancing, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. These actions have altered macroeconomic conditions and created recession-like environments around the world. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who have the ability to work remotely. The mandated orders to "shelter-in-place" and other social distancing measures have directly and indirectly affected sales and supply chain activities. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, retailers focused on carefully managing inventory and prioritizing demand for essential products while reducing operating hours, limiting foot traffic and temporarily closing stores. Starting in the second quarter of 2020, we saw demand for our Roomba and Braava robots accelerate as maintaining a clean home took on increasing importance to people while they spent more time at home, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements. At the same time, we navigated a myriad of supply chain challenges that were compounded by COVID-19 to cost-effectively source sufficient raw materials and components, and increase volume. 
2020 Highlights
Since the introduction of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner ("RVC") in 2002, we have sold more than 30 million consumer robots worldwide to become a global, market-leading consumer robotics innovator with a strong presence in major geographic regions worldwide. In 2020, iRobot sold more than $1.4 billion in consumer robots and navigated very challenging market conditions as the COVID-19 pandemic directly and indirectly impacted all aspects of our business. Our commitment to innovation and funding critical research and development projects continued to yield tangible results through new product 
launches and new and enhanced features and functionality. In addition to launching the Roomba i3 and i3+ in North America during 2020, we introduced the iRobot Genius Home Intelligence ("Genius"), a powerful new platform that delivers an expansive range of digital features and experiences across our entire line of Wi-Fi connected floor cleaning robots. Genius powers the iRobot HOME App, through which Roomba and Braava users can operate their WiFi-connected floor cleaning robots. Genius delivers a far greater level of personalization and control over user's floor cleaning robots and enables users to determine when, where and how their robots clean. In addition, users can receive suggestions from the HOME app about their cleaning activities that factor in their unique homes, schedules, cleaning preferences and smart home integrations. In addition to these major new product launches, we introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ in the Asia Pacific region and the Roomba Combo in select European countries during 2020. 
Other 2020 highlights included our efforts to balance cost reductions as the global pandemic began with investments to advance software-based research and development and support the growth of our direct-to-consumer sales channel. Operationally, we managed through substantial changes in anticipated demand to align production across our supply chain with substantially higher orders over the course of the year while advancing plans to expand our manufacturing capacity and overcome pandemic-related delays in Malaysia. Our profitability in 2020 benefited from a temporary exclusion to United States tariffs on RVCs made in and imported from China which expired on December 31, 2020. We also appointed new leaders to oversee our finance, accounting and IT; supply chain; commercial; and marketing organizations. 
Our total revenue for 2020 was $1,430.4 million, which represents a 17.8% increase from revenue of $1,214.0 million for 2019. Domestic revenue grew $141.0 million, or 23.4%, and international revenue increased by $75.4 million, or 12.3%, primarily as a result of higher sales of premium robots priced over $500. 
Strategy
Our long-term strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth is focused on: 1) designing and marketing a portfolio of floor cleaning robots with differentiated value propositions that appeal to an expanding range of consumers around the world, enabling us to continue increasing category penetration globally; 2) advancing innovation through the introduction of new models of floor cleaning robots, and new features and enhanced functionality of existing models of floor cleaning robots that will address the needs of new and existing customers; 3) forging enduring relationships with millions of consumers worldwide in ways that will ultimately increase their spending with us over the lifetime of those relationships; 4) continuing to diversify our product portfolio beyond RVCs; and 5) balancing investments in key technology, product development, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other initiatives with an ongoing focus on controlling costs, increasing productivity and driving efficiency.
The three key elements in our strategy are 1) differentiating the cleaning experience; 2) building long-term, enduring customer relationships; and 3) nurturing the lifetime value of our customer relationships. By executing on each element of our strategy, we believe we can better position iRobot to build and defend its category leadership, participate meaningfully in continued category growth, build a stronger direct-to-consumer sales channel to complement our extensive retail partnerships, and convert our top-line growth into even faster operating profit and earnings per share expansion.
Technology
Since the Roomba’s introduction in 2002, we have continuously pursued innovation and introduced a wide of range of powerful features and functionality that have been favorably received by customers, helped extend our consumer robot technology and category leadership, and have further expanded our product portfolio. Over the past several years, we have focused on research and development initiatives that advance overall cleaning efficacy and performance, increase the autonomy of our products and enable personalized control over how, when and where our robots clean. By leveraging our robust connectivity and cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services and the ever-increasing processing power in our robots, we have built a Home Knowledge Cloud that can quickly and cost-effectively support over-the-air delivery of new digital features and enhanced functionality for customers globally. This infrastructure also allows us to collect valuable performance data that helps us improve the effectiveness of our support teams, helps inform our product roadmaps and facilitates integration with other connected devices in the smart home. 
Our development roadmaps are shaped by our product management teams, interactions between customers and our support teams, a wide range of consumer studies and surveys, as well as the aforementioned analysis of extensive performance data of our robots in the field. We believe that the 2020 launch of the Genius platform will continue to play an increasingly important role in our ability to consistently deliver new features and functionality in our floor cleaning robots to improve performance, continue to address the needs of our customers and advance the smart home experience. We also plan to continue leveraging recent and ongoing investments in a range of technologies and interfaces, including artificial intelligence, home understanding and machine vision, that further improve cleaning efficacy, make our products easier to use and perform better, 
increase the trust that the user places in our products to successfully complete their missions, and tightly integrate our products into the lifestyles of our users. 
Products
We sell various products designed to empower people to do more in and around their homes. We believe our home floor cleaning robots deliver compelling and unique value to customers by delivering a better way to clean that frees people from repetitive, time consuming home cleaning tasks. To ensure the continued acceptance of our robots, we plan to continue to invest in the digital, data and physical products necessary to further improve the robots' cleaning efficacy, deliver the requisite autonomy to complete missions without requiring user intervention, and offer personalized control over cleaning so that the robots fit seamlessly into the lifestyle of their owners. As part of our efforts to control costs, accelerate certain strategic initiatives and further shift research and development engineering talent from hardware to software, we suspended go-to-market plans for our Terra robot mower during 2020. While we continue to believe that product diversification is an important element of our long-term growth strategy, this specific initiative is expected to remain on hold for the foreseeable future in part because we believe our ability to successfully and efficiently bring new product categories to market will be enhanced by our near-term investments to build stronger, enduring customer relationships and nurture the lifetime value of these relationships. 
All of our WiFi-connected floor cleaning robots benefit from iRobot Genius Home Intelligence, our powerful robot platform that unlocks an expansive range of digital features and experiences to give users an unmatched level of personalization and control over their cleaning robots, accounting for their unique homes, schedules, cleaning preferences and smart home integrations.

The Root coding robots, priced at $129 and $199, are designed to make coding easy and natural to learn. Using the engaging Root Coding App, kids of any age can learn coding fundamentals while they play, explore, and create.
Strategic Alliances
In addition to our internal technology development, we leverage relevant robotic technologies through licensing, acquisitions, venture investments and/or other partnerships. These strategic alliances are an important part of our product development, advanced research and distribution strategies. We rely on strategic alliances to provide technology and complementary product offerings to drive market adoption of our robotic products. 
We seek to form relationships with organizations that can provide best-in-class technology or market advantages for establishing iRobot technology. In 2019, we began a Smart Home Partner Program that enables select third parties to partner closely with iRobot in using certain data available in iRobot’s Home Knowledge Cloud to deliver enhanced product features and customer value. Consistent with our position on customer data privacy, our customer data is not accessible to third parties unless the customer affirmatively opts into the program and acknowledges that this home understanding data will be used in support of these related integrations. We are also advancing technology alliances with other smart home device companies that will enable our respective products to be integrated more tightly and thereby work together more seamlessly. Additionally, we plan to explore opportunities to forge strategic alliances that will enable us to resell complementary third-party products directly to our customers. 
Sales and Distribution Channels
We sell our consumer products through distributor and retail sales channels, as well as our on-line store. For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 47.9%, 50.3%, and 48.7% of total revenue, respectively. For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we generated 22.7%, 21.3% and 17.3% of total revenue, respectively, from one of our retailers. 
In the United States, Canada, Japan and across much of Europe, we sell our consumer products primarily through a network of retailers. To support these retailers, we maintain in-house sales, marketing and product management teams. Certain smaller retail operations in these regions are supported by distributors to whom we sell our products directly. Throughout the rest of the world, our products are sold primarily through a network of in-country distributors who resell to retail stores in their respective countries. These distributors are supported by our international sales and product marketing team. In China, retailers are serviced by three local distributors. Due to the special needs of this market, we maintain a local sales, marketing and product team to support the distributors, manage the local marketing plan and meet product needs. 
Our retail and distributor networks are our primary distribution channels for our products. Complementing our retail and distributor networks is a growing direct-to-consumer sales channel. For the fiscal years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, direct sales to consumers accounted for 10.5%, 5.8% and 4.4% of total revenue, respectively. We ended 2020 with nearly 10 million connected customers who have opted in to our digital communications, up more than 80% over the end of 2019.
Customer Service and Support
We also provide ongoing customer service and support. Consumer customer service representatives, the majority of whom are employees of outsourced service organizations or our distribution partners, are extensively trained on the technical intricacies of our consumer products. With Wi-Fi connectivity implemented across Roomba 675 and higher models, we can provide customer support directly via the iRobot HOME App and our customer service representatives can access robot 
performance information remotely to identify relevant issues and behaviors to more efficiently and effectively troubleshoot and address customer questions and concerns. In addition, this connectivity enables us to provide direct marketing material and push new features/fixes to robots in the field. 
Marketing and Brand
We market our consumer robots to end-user customers through our extensive network of retail partners with the support of our sales and marketing teams as well as in collaborations with in-country distributors. In addition, we sell directly to consumers through our e-commerce channels around the world and continually improve the buying experience on our website and Home App. For consumers seeking information about our products, the iRobot website showcases our brand, allows consumers to learn more about our products, including the latest product innovations, and enables direct-to-consumer sales. The website also plays an important after-sales role for owners seeking spare parts and accessories, as well as for trouble-shooting possible issues and contacting customer support.
Our marketing strategy is to drive consumer awareness of and interest in iRobot's product portfolio, most notably Roomba robot vacuums and Braava robot mops, and convert this interest into sales via our retail and direct-to-consumer channels. Our sales and marketing expenses represented 18.6%, 19.1% and 19.3% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in national advertising across a range of media, consumer and industry trade shows, direct marketing and public relations to drive consumer demand and further build brand awareness. 
Marketing highlights in 2020 included advancing an initiative to upgrade our marketing technology infrastructure, enhancing the e-commerce functionality on iRobot.com and our HOME App, and supporting the launches of the iRobot Genius Home Intelligence Platform and the i3/i3+ Series Roomba in the United States. In addition, we continued to execute critical marketing, advertising and public relations efforts to build demand generation in ways that amplify the iRobot and applicable product brands, generate consumer interest in our products and perpetuate customer word-of-mouth, to encourage repeat purchases by existing customers and inspire new customers to buy our products. During 2021, we expect to continue our efforts to elevate the iRobot brand while also accelerating investments aimed at enhancing the buying experience on our digital properties and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our demand-generation capabilities targeting our connected customer base. 
Manufacturing
Our core competencies are the design, development and marketing of robots. Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource non-core competencies, such as the production of our robots, to third-party entities skilled in manufacturing. By relying on the outsourced manufacture of our robots, we can focus our engineering expertise on the design of robots and associated technologies.
Manufacturing a new product requires a close relationship between our product designers, our operations teams and the contract manufacturer, as well as a range of component and raw materials suppliers as appropriate. Using multiple engineering techniques, our products are introduced to the selected production facility at an early-development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before tooling is finalized and mass production begins. As a result, we believe that we can significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and yields. Once a new product has been introduced, we focus on executing a multi-year plan to improve its profitability through a combination of higher production volume and cost-optimization initiatives. 
Under our agreements with our contract manufacturers, the manufacturers supply us with specified quantities of products that align with demand forecasts that we establish based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions. We believe that we have taken steps to diversify our manufacturing so that overall volumes are relatively well balanced across our multiple contract manufacturers and a substantial majority of volume is dual sourced. Our production processes are expected to give us the capacity to produce up to 29,000 robots a day, helping us to meet demand for peak seasons and provide us with additional greater geographical diversity and flexibility to respond to ever-changing market conditions.
We outsource the manufacturing of our consumer products to four contract manufacturers with plants in Southern China. In late 2019, we commenced manufacturing in Malaysia with one of our existing contract manufacturers. Although the COVID-19 pandemic delayed our efforts to increase production volume and limited the number of Roomba models manufactured in Malaysia during 2020, one of our top priorities in 2021 is to qualify additional contract manufacturers, produce more Roomba models and substantially expand manufacturing volumes in Malaysia. By expanding production in Malaysia and selling those products in the United States, we believe that we will substantially reduce and potentially eliminate our exposure to current U.S. tariffs, and mitigate the geopolitical risks associated with concentrating production solely in China. 
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop new products and product accessories, and enhance and develop new applications for our existing products. For the years ended January 2, 2021, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, our research and development expenses were $156.7 million, $141.6 million and $140.6 million, or 11.0%, 11.7% and 12.9% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs, and to enable us to introduce new products over the next few years that will continue to address our existing and adjacent market sectors.
Our research and development is conducted by teams dedicated to particular projects, which are primarily located at our headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts and our office in Pasadena, California.
Competition
The market for robots, including floor cleaning robots, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations, with an increasing number of competitor companies and products. As the performance, functionality and features of our floor cleaning robots have advanced, we believe that consumers are increasingly willing to consider our products as replacements for their traditional vacuum cleaners and wet floor cleaning products. A number of established companies have developed robots that compete directly with our product offerings, and many of our competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess. Our robot cleaning competitors include consumer electronics and consumer appliance companies such as Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Xiaomi, Cecotec, Hitachi, Electrolux, Midea and Shark, traditional floor cleaning brands with robotic offerings such as Dyson, Bissell and Hoover, and firms primarily focused on robotic cleaning such as Ecovacs, Roborock, Neato and iLife. In addition to dedicated robot vacuum and robot mop products, certain consumers prefer a floor cleaning robot that consolidates both vacuuming and mopping in a single product. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for robots include product features, performance for the intended mission, total cost of system operation and overall perceived value, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.
Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development and customer support, particularly as it relates to delivering exceptional value to customers. We remain committed to funding the enhancement of our products and the development of new products, as well as investing in the various sales, marketing and support activities we believe are necessary to stimulate customer demand and maintain and improve customer satisfaction. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the technical competence and ability of our employees to continue to innovate. The ownership of intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We currently hold a significant number of patents and have filed numerous additional patent applications. As of January 2, 2021, we held 538 U.S. patents, more than 1,000 foreign patents, additional design registrations, and have more than 1,500 patent applications pending worldwide. While our U.S. patents will begin to expire in 2021, no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. We will continue to file and prosecute patent (or design registration, as applicable) applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents for our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. In that regard, we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances. It is also possible that we may not develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are patentable, or that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will harm or altogether preclude our ability to do business.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include iRobot and its stylized logo, Roomba, Clean Base, NorthStar, Create, Clean Map, iAdapt, Home Base, Looj, Braava, Braava jet, AeroForce, AllergenLock, Better Together, PerfectEdge, Corners. Edges. And the Details in Between., Imprint, Mirra, Root, Terra, vSLAM and Virtual Wall. Our marks iRobot, Roomba, Braava, Braava jet, Better Together, Root, Clean Base, Clean Map, Imprint, PerfectEdge, Terra, Virtual Wall, and certain other trademarks, have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to ours. Legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to 
protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Some of our competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low-cost structures while infringing on our intellectual property. 
On October 15, 2019, we initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts against SharkNinja Operating LLC and its related entities ("SharkNinja") for infringement of five patents for technology related to robotic vacuum cleaners. In addition, we sought a preliminary injunction against SharkNinja for infringement of three U.S. patents. SharkNinja has in parallel sought declarations of non-infringement of thirteen U.S. patents owned by iRobot. On November 26, 2019, the federal district court in Massachusetts denied iRobot's motion for a preliminary injunction, and the case is proceeding toward trial.
On January 28, 2021, we initiated litigation against SharkNinja at the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") as well as in federal district court in Massachusetts based on claims of patent infringement of five additional U.S. patents related to robotic vacuum cleaners.
There is no guarantee that we will prevail on other patent infringement claims against third parties. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or the technology underlying our products is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. We have received in the past communications from third parties relating to technologies used in our various robot products that have alleged infringement of patents or violation of other intellectual property rights. Some of these allegations have resulted in actions filed against iRobot in foreign jurisdictions. In response to these communications, we have contacted these third parties to convey our good faith belief that we do not infringe the patents in question or otherwise violate those parties' rights. Where an action has been filed, we will defend iRobot against the allegations. We cannot assure you that we will not receive further correspondence from these parties, not be subject to additional allegations of infringement from others, and cannot assure you that iRobot will prevail in any ongoing or subsequently filed actions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we attempt to design around the technology at issue or to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering applicable software or product solutions, our continued supply of software or product solutions could be disrupted or our introduction of new or enhanced software or products could be significantly delayed.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due in large part to increased demand around the December holiday season. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our second-half consumer product revenue represented 67.0%, 59.0% and 59.4% of our annual consumer product revenue, respectively. We believe that the pandemic’s impact on our business, our retail partners and the spending of consumers worldwide further skewed the balance of revenue in favor of 2020 second-half revenue contribution. We have also experienced higher selling and marketing expenses in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due to increase marketing campaigns to support seasonal holiday demand. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our selling and marketing expense in the second half of the year represented 67.7%, 58.9% and 63.3% of our selling and marketing expense for full fiscal year, respectively. We expect that the majority of our revenue and selling and marketing expenses will continue to be generated in the second half of any given fiscal year unless or until we successfully introduce new products, that have potential to generate stronger sales during the first half of the year.
Regulations
Our business requires compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. In particular, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and California Consumer Privacy Act. In addition, the global nature of our business operations also creates various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subjects us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. Our products may be subject to U.S. export controls, including the United States Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and trade policies and tariffs established by the governments of the United States, China and other jurisdictions where we do business.
The laws in each of these areas - in particular those related to data privacy - are continually changing and evolving in unpredictable ways. New laws and regulations in any of these areas, as well as compliance with these laws (and their derivatives) may have an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties.
We are also subject to international and U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, regulate energy efficiency and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
Human Capital
As of January 2, 2021, we had 1,209 full-time employees. Approximately 29% of our employees are based outside of the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees. To date, we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Culture and Work Environment 
Over the past three decades, iRobot has created and amplified a unique culture built on fostering invention, discovery and technological exploration in the pursuit of practical and value-add robot products for the next-generation home. iRobot is committed to attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent, leveraging new perspectives, ideas, skills, languages and cultural backgrounds and providing the resources for individuals to reach their full potential. We’ve assembled a global team of talented, motivated and unique individuals by providing our people with opportunities to make a tangible impact in helping our company thrive while also advancing their careers. In addition, iRobot’s culture is further shaped by an ongoing commitment to the future of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ("STEM") education. This effort spans our educational robots, a range of complementary educational resources and our STEM outreach program, which is focused on engaging and inspiring students of all ages to learn more about robotics.
Underpinning our culture is an ongoing commitment to ensuring that our employees, customers and suppliers are treated with dignity and respect. We strive to maintain a workplace that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions. Our policy is to provide a safe and healthy workplace and comply with applicable safety and health laws and regulations, as well as internal requirements. Additionally, the safety and health of our employees is of paramount importance to us, particularly as we continue to navigate the direct and indirect challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the many actions taken to support our employees during the pandemic, we implemented flexible work from home policies, adopted a wide range of sanitization and cleaning protocols to keep our offices safer and instituted regular virtual town hall meetings to keep employees informed. In addition, our employees proactively donated time, resources and technology to support healthcare workers on the front lines. We supported several COVID-19 relief initiatives, such as donating thousands of masks from our manufacturing facilities to healthcare workers, participating in a project to repurpose Roomba filters for use in personal protective equipment, retrofitting Roomba in Italian hospitals with a tripod and phone to connect patients with their families and releasing numerous free online and offline learning materials for both teachers and students.
Compensation, Rewards and Benefits
In addition to competitive base salaries, we provide incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics. We also provide compensation in the form of restricted stock unit grants as well as a competitive time-off policy. We offer comprehensive benefit options, including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and an employee stock purchase plan, among others. 
We are committed to the continued development of our people. We offer opportunities for personal and technical development with programs such as our leadership training, management training, mentoring program and educational assistance. We continue to evolve our approach to attracting and retaining our talent – from having a well-defined process for hiring to continuing to enhance our compensation and benefits packages.
Diversity and Inclusion
iRobot is an inclusive organization, seeking out the best and brightest minds to help us meet the global requirements of our business. We are excited to welcome new perspectives, ideas, skills, languages and cultural backgrounds to our global iRobot family.
The iRobot community is built upon the diverse perspectives, beliefs and backgrounds of incredibly talented people from around the world who have all had a hand in shaping who we are as an organization. Strengthening diversity within our global workforce enables iRobot to bring our collective ideas together to invent a future that seamlessly fits the unique, personal and diverse needs of our global consumer base. We have and will continue to take action and hold ourselves accountable to 
continue to foster equality and diversity on a global scale. Each day we learn from each other, grow and evolve, seeking out new opportunities to strengthen our support for all employees and the communities in which we work.
As a symbol of our commitment, iRobot Founder, CEO and Chairman Colin Angle signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge on Juneteenth 2020. We are creating opportunities to have an ongoing dialogue with our employees. We have also prioritized a series of training programs to educate and empower our team, including Creating an Inclusive Workplace and Unconscious Bias. Additionally, we continue to focus on developing new capabilities and programs that will continue to raise awareness and education around racial equality and discrimination.
