Item 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
Our Company
We were incorporated in Maryland on October 20, 1997 and commenced operations on March 17, 1998. Our principal business is to invest in, finance and manage a leveraged portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, and residential mortgage loans, which presently includes the following types of investments:

◾ | Agency mortgage-backed securities, or Agency MBS, which include residential mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, which are securities representing interests in pools of mortgage loans secured by residential property in which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise, or GSE, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, or Non-Agency MBS, which are securities issued by companies that are not guaranteed by federally sponsored enterprises and that are secured primarily by first-lien residential mortgage loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Residential mortgage loans. We acquire non-Qualified Mortgage, or Non-QM, residential mortgage loans (which are described further on page 86) from independent loan originators with the intent of holding these loans for securitization. These loans are financed by a warehouse line of credit until securitization. We also hold residential mortgage loans through consolidated securitization trusts. We finance these loans through asset-backed securities, or ABS, issued by the consolidated securitization trusts. The ABS, which are held by unaffiliated third parties, are non-recourse financing. The difference in the amount of the loans in the trusts and the amount of the ABS represents our retained net interest in the securitization trusts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders primarily based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage assets and our borrowing costs to finance our acquisition of those assets.
We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As long as we retain our REIT status, we generally will not be subject to federal or state income taxes to the extent that we distribute our taxable net income to our stockholders, and we routinely distribute to our stockholders substantially all of the taxable net income generated from our operations. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must meet various ongoing requirements under the tax law, including requirements relating to the composition of our assets, the nature of our gross income, minimum distribution requirements and requirements relating to the ownership of our stock.
Proposed Merger with Ready Capital Corporation
​
On December 6, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Ready Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Ready Capital”), and RC Merger Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ready Capital (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, our Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub remaining as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ready Capital (such transaction, the “Merger”).
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Anworth Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares held by Ready Capital, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries) will automatically be converted into the right to receive from Ready Capital (i) 0.1688 shares of common stock, par 

1



value $0.0001, of Ready Capital (“Ready Capital Common Stock”), plus (ii) $0.61 in cash minus the Per Share Excess Amount, in each case, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement. The Per Share Excess Amount means an amount, if any, per share by which our termination expenses and transaction expenses exceed $32.5 million. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Ready Capital Common Stock that would have been received as a result of the Merger.
Additionally, at the Effective Time, each share of our 8.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, will be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated series of Ready Capital preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which Ready Capital expects will be classified and designed as Ready Capital’s Series B Preferred Stock (“Ready Capital Series B Preferred Stock”); each share of our 6.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, will be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated series of Ready Capital preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which Ready Capital expects will be classified and designed as Ready Capital’s Series C Preferred Stock (“Ready Capital Series C Preferred Stock”); and each share of our 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, will be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated series of Ready Capital preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which Ready Capital expects will be classified and designed as Ready Capital’s Series D Preferred Stock (“Ready Capital Series D Preferred Stock”).
The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, (a) the approval of the issuance of the Ready Capital Common Stock in connection with the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of Ready Capital stockholders, (b) the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Anworth Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger, (c) the registration and listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Ready Capital Common Stock, Ready Capital Series B Preferred Stock, Ready Capital Series C Preferred Stock, and Ready Capital Series D Preferred Stock that will be issued in connection with the Merger, (d) the respective representations and warranties of the parties being true and correct, subject to the materiality standards contained in the Merger Agreement, (e) each party’s compliance in all material respects with their respective covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement, (f) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either our Company or Ready Capital, (g) the effectiveness of an amendment to our management agreement between us and our external manager pertaining to the termination of our management agreement effective as of the Effective Time, (h) the effectiveness of an amendment to the management agreement between Ready Capital and its external manager pertaining to the reduction in the base management fee payable to Ready Capital’s external manager by $1,000,000 per quarter for each of the first four full quarters following the Effective Time, and (i) the delivery of certain documents and certificates.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each party. The respective representations and warranties of the parties are subject to certain important qualifications and limitations set forth in confidential disclosure letters delivered by us, on the one hand, and Ready Capital, on the other hand, and were made solely for purposes of the contract among the parties. The representations and warranties are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to stockholders, and the representations and warranties are primarily intended to establish circumstances in which either of the parties may not be obligated to consummate the Merger, rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that each of our Company and Ready Capital will, until the Effective Time, operate their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course and consistent with practice, and preserve substantially intact its current business organization and preserve key business relationships. Each of our Company and Ready Capital are subject to restrictions as specified in the Merger Agreement on certain actions each company may take prior to the Effective Time, including, among other things, actions related to amending organizational documents, declaring dividends, issuing or repurchasing capital stock, engaging in certain business transactions and incurring indebtedness.
The combined company will operate under the name Ready Capital and its shares are expected to continue trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the existing ticker symbol “RC”.
Upon completion of the merger, Ready Capital’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Capasse will lead the combined company and Ready Capital executives Jack Ross, Thomas Buttacavoli, Andrew Ahlborn and Gary 

2



Taylor will remain in their current roles. The combined company will be headquartered in New York, New York. The board of directors of the combined company is expected to have eight directors, consisting of Ready Capital’s existing seven directors and one independent director from our current board of directors.
In connection with the Merger, Ready Capital has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-4, containing a joint proxy statement/prospectus. The joint proxy/prospectus contains important information about the Merger and related matters. 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the related transactions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020.
Our Manager
We are externally managed and advised by Anworth Management, LLC, or our Manager. Our Manager is supervised and directed by our board of directors, or our Board. Our day-to-day operations are being conducted by our Manager through the authority delegated to it under the Management Agreement between us and our Manager (which we refer to as the “Management Agreement”) and pursuant to the policies established by our Board.
Our Manager will also perform such other services and activities relating to our assets and operations as described in the Management Agreement. In exchange for services provided, our Manager receives a management fee paid monthly in arrears in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.20% of our Equity (as defined in the Management Agreement).
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we, our Manager, and Ready Capital entered into an amendment to the Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement Amendment”). The Management Agreement Amendment provides that upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Management Agreement will terminate, and as a result of the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the termination of the Management Agreement, we will pay our Manager a termination fee of $20.3 million, and Ready Capital or Merger Sub (as the surviving company following the Merger) will reimburse our Manager for certain unpaid expenses and pay to our Manager all accrued and unpaid management fees then owed under the Management Agreement, as and when specified in the Management Agreement Amendment. The foregoing description of the Management Agreement Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Management Agreement Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020.
The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has generally not affected our Manager’s ability to manage our day-to-day operations and provide other services to us under the Management Agreement, as the Manager’s key employees and personnel who manage our operations are able to effectively work from home and provide such services to us under applicable local and state shelter-in-place orders.

Our Investment Strategy
Our investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our stockholders over the long-term primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. Our strategy is to invest in residential MBS (both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS), residential mortgage loans, and residential rental properties.
We seek to acquire assets that will produce competitive returns after considering the amount and nature of the investment’s anticipated returns, our ability to pledge the investment to secure collateralized borrowings and the costs associated with financing, managing and reserving for these investments.
Financing Strategy
Our primary financing source for our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS portfolios is repurchase agreements.

4



We have acquired residential mortgage loans that are being held-for-securitization. These loans are financed by a warehouse line of credit, which is a short-term revolving credit facility extended by a financial institution for loans that are being held pending securitization. 
We also invest in the subordinate classes of newly-formed securitization trusts, which allows us to consolidate all of the loans of these trusts. These residential mortgage loans are financed through ABS issued by the securitization trusts. The ABS which are held by unaffiliated third parties are non-recourse financing. The difference in the amount of the loans and the amount of the ABS represents our retained net interest in the loans held in the securitization trusts.
We employ short-term borrowing to attempt to increase potential returns to our stockholders. Pursuant to our Capital and Leverage Policy, we seek to strike a balance between the under-utilization of leverage, which reduces potential returns to stockholders, and the over-utilization of leverage, which could reduce our ability to meet our obligations during adverse market conditions.
The amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target investments depends upon an assessment of a variety of factors, which may include: the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets; the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges; the availability and cost of financing our assets; our opinion of the credit worthiness of financing counterparties; the health of the U.S. economy and residential mortgage and housing markets; our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates; the credit quality of the loans we acquire and the loans underlying our MBS; and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, curve.
Repurchase agreements are financings pursuant to which one party, the seller or borrower, sells assets to the repurchase agreement counterparty, the buyer or lender, for an agreed price with the obligation to repurchase the assets from the buyer at a future date and at a price higher than the original purchase price. The amount of financing available under a repurchase agreement is limited to a specified percentage of the estimated market value of the assets. The difference between the sale price and repurchase price is the interest expense of financing under a repurchase agreement. Under repurchase agreement financing arrangements, if the value of the collateral decreases, the buyer could require the seller to provide additional cash or other collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of borrowing. In the current financing climate, lenders using repurchase agreements generally advance approximately 95% of the market value of the Agency MBS financed (meaning a 5% haircut) and 65% to 80% of the market value of the Non-Agency MBS financed (meaning a 20% to 35% haircut). A significant decrease in advance rate or an increase in the haircut could result in our having to sell securities in order to meet additional margin requirements by the lender. We expect to mitigate our risk of margin calls under repurchase agreements by deploying a prudent amount of leverage.
In order to reduce our exposure to counterparty-related risk, we generally seek to diversify our exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.47 billion of outstanding balances under repurchase agreements with 15 different counterparties, with a maximum net exposure (the difference between the amount loaned to us and the value of the assets pledged by us as collateral) to any single lender of approximately $22.1 million, or approximately 5.4% of our equity.
Growth Strategy
It is our long-term objective to grow our earnings and our dividends per common share by increasing our paid-in capital and book value per share.
Our Target Investments
Our investment portfolio is focused on two different strategies that embody our hybrid investment approach. The target investments that fall under these strategies are:
Agency MBS
This strategy includes investing in Agency MBS and the related derivative transactions. The performance of this 

5



strategy is most affected by changes in interest rates, prepayments and mortgage spreads relative to U.S. Treasury securities. These assets have minimal exposure to the underlying credit of the investments. Agency MBS are collateralized by fixed-rate mortgage loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, hybrid mortgage loans, or any derivatives thereof, including:

◾ | mortgage pass-through certificates issued by a GSE such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | “to-be-announced” forward contracts, or TBAs, which are pools of mortgages with specific investment terms to be issued by government-sponsored enterprises at a future date.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mortgage Credit Investments
These assets include investing in Non-Agency MBS, residential mortgage loans, and related derivative transactions. Examples of Non-Agency MBS include MBS collateralized by prime mortgage loans, Alt-A mortgage loans and subprime mortgage loans, which may have fixed-rate, adjustable-rate or hybrid-rate terms.
Non-Agency MBS
Non-Agency MBS includes both senior and mezzanine MBS. Senior MBS refers to Non-Agency MBS that represent the senior-most tranches – that is, tranches which have the highest priority claim to cash flows from the related collateral pool within the MBS structure. Mezzanine MBS refers to subordinated tranches within the collateral pool. The Non-Agency MBS we purchase may include investment grade and non-investment grade classes including non-rated securities.
We believe the performance of our Non-Agency MBS and residential mortgage loans are most affected by changes in credit performance of the underlying collateral. These assets also have interest rate and mortgage spread exposure, but we do not believe these exposures to be the main drivers of performance.
Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Securitization
Residential mortgage loans held for securitization are held at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Anworth Mortgage Loans, Inc. (incorporated August 2017), with the intent to sponsor our own securitizations. The residential mortgage loans held-for-securitization are financed by a warehouse line of credit.
Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment Through Consolidated Securitization Trusts
We invest in residential mortgage loans held-for-investment through consolidated securitization trusts. We finance our residential mortgage loans through ABS issued by the consolidated securitization trusts. The ABS which are held by unaffiliated third parties are non-recourse financing. The difference in the amount of the loans and the amount of the ABS represents our retained net interest in the loans held in the securitization trusts.
Residential Real Estate
These assets consist primarily of single-family residential properties which, after renovation, we lease to tenants. Our focus is on properties that produce high occupancy and attractive rental rates and generate long-term property appreciation.
Our Operating Policies and Programs
We have established the following four primary operating policies to implement our business strategies:

◾ | our Asset Acquisition Policy;
--+------------------------------


◾ | our Capital and Leverage Policy;
--+---------------------------------

6




◾ | our Credit Risk Management Policy; and
--+---------------------------------------


◾ | our Asset/Liability Management Policy.
--+---------------------------------------

Asset Acquisition Policy
Our Asset Acquisition Policy provides guidelines for acquiring investments and contemplates that we will acquire a portfolio of investments that can be grouped into specific categories. Each category and our respective investment guidelines are as follows:

◾ | Category I — At least 60% of our total assets will generally be high-quality MBS, unsecuritized prime residential mortgage loans, and short-term investments. MBS in this category will be rated within one of the three highest rating categories (A- rated or better) by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization or, if not rated, will be obligations guaranteed by a GSE, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Also included in Category I are the portion of mortgage loans that have been deposited into a trust and have received a rating within one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Category II — At least 90% of our total assets will generally consist of Category I investments plus other mortgage-related assets. Included in this category are mortgage securities not rated within one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization, mortgage derivative securities, mortgage servicing rights, unsecuritized non-prime residential mortgage loans, shares of other REITs or mortgage-related companies and the portion of real estate mortgage loans that have been deposited into a trust and have not received a rating within one of the three highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Category III — Assets not meeting any of the above criteria will be less than 10% of our total assets. Included in this category is the ownership of real estate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capital and Leverage Policy
We employ a leverage strategy to increase our investment assets by borrowing against existing mortgage-related assets and using the proceeds to acquire additional mortgage-related assets. Our borrowings may vary from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our management and our Board. We believe that this will leave an adequate capital base to protect against interest rate environments in which our borrowing costs might exceed our interest income from mortgage-related assets. At December 31, 2020, our leverage on capital (including common stockholders’ equity, all preferred stock, and junior subordinated notes) was 3.4x.
Our mortgage-related assets are financed primarily at short-term borrowing rates through repurchase agreements. We also employ borrowings under a warehouse line of credit that we established with an institutional lender.
Credit Risk Management Policy
Subject to the constraints of our Asset Acquisition Policy, we are allowed to own both investment grade and non-investment grade Non-Agency MBS and other mortgage-related assets. Prior to purchase, we review credit risk and other risks of loss associated with each of our potential investments. To lessen our overall credit risk, we may diversify our portfolio of mortgage-related assets relative to geographic, insurer, industry and certain other types of concentrations. With respect to loans acquired for securitization, we employ an independent due diligence firm to ensure that the loans are in accordance with our established credit lending guidelines and policies.
If there is a decline in the credit quality of any of our Non-Agency MBS holdings or in our loans, we may, after evaluation, maintain or increase our holdings or liquidate all or a portion of the position. We are not required to sell a security when it is moved to a lower Category in our Asset Acquisition Policy.

Asset/Liability Management Policy
Interest Rate Risk Management. To the extent consistent with our election to qualify as a REIT, we follow an interest rate risk management program intended to protect our portfolio of mortgage-related assets and related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes. Specifically, our interest rate management program is formulated with the intent to offset, to some extent, the potential adverse effects resulting from rate adjustment limitations on our mortgage-related assets and the differences between interest rate adjustment indices and interest rate adjustment periods of our adjustable-rate mortgage-related assets and related borrowings.
Our interest rate risk management program encompasses a number of procedures including the following:

◾ | monitoring and adjusting, if necessary, the interest rate sensitivity of our mortgage-related assets compared with the interest rate sensitivities of our borrowings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | attempting to structure our borrowing agreements relating to adjustable-rate mortgage-related assets to have a range of different maturities and interest rate adjustment periods (although substantially all will be less than one year); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | actively managing, on an aggregate basis, the interest rate indices and interest rate adjustment periods of our mortgage-related assets compared to the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our borrowings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to be able to adjust the average maturity/adjustment period of our borrowings on an ongoing basis by changing the mix of maturities and interest rate adjustment periods as borrowings come due or are renewed. Through the use of these procedures, we attempt to reduce the risk of differences between interest rate adjustment periods of our adjustable-rate mortgage-related assets and our related borrowings.
Depending on market conditions and the cost of the transactions, we may conduct certain hedging activities in connection with the management of our portfolio. To the extent consistent with our election to qualify as a REIT, we may adopt a hedging strategy intended to lessen the effects of interest rate changes and to enable us to earn net interest income in periods of generally rising, as well as declining or static, interest rates. Specifically, hedging programs are formulated with the intent to offset some of the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rate levels relative to the interest rates on the mortgage-related assets held in our investment portfolio and differences between the interest rate adjustment indices and periods of our mortgage-related assets and our borrowings. We monitor carefully, and may have to limit, our hedging activity to assure that we do not realize excessive hedging income or hold hedges having excess value in relation to our mortgage-related assets, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT or, in the case of excess hedging income, if the excess is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, the payment of a penalty tax for failure to satisfy certain REIT income tests under the Code. In addition, hedging activity involves transaction costs that increase dramatically as the period covered by hedging protection increases and that may increase during periods of fluctuating interest rates.
Prepayment Risk Management. We also seek to lessen the effects of prepayment of mortgage loans underlying our investments at a faster or slower rate than anticipated. We accomplish this by structuring a diversified portfolio with a variety of prepayment characteristics, investing in mortgage-related assets whose underlying loans have attractive prepayment characteristics, and purchasing mortgage-related assets at a premium or at a discount. 
We believe that we have developed cost-effective asset/liability management policies to mitigate prepayment risks. However, no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risks. Further, as noted above, certain of the federal income tax requirements that we must satisfy to qualify as a REIT limit our ability to fully hedge our prepayment risks. Therefore, we could be prevented from effectively hedging our prepayment risks.

Our Investment Portfolio
Agency MBS
Residential Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates. We principally invest in pass-through certificates, which are securities representing interests in “pools” of mortgage loans secured by residential real property in which payments of both interest and principal on the securities are generally made monthly to holders of the security, in effect “passing through” monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities, net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the securities. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among certificate holders. The payment of principal and interest on these securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae or a GSE, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Early repayment of principal on some MBS, arising from prepayments of principal due to sale of the underlying property, refinancing or foreclosure, net of fees and costs which may be incurred, may expose us to a lower rate of return upon reinvestment of principal. This is generally referred to as “prepayment risk.” Additionally, if a security subject to prepayment has been purchased at a premium, the unamortized value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.
Like other fixed-income securities, when interest rates rise, the value of a mortgage-backed security generally will decline. When interest rates are declining, however, the value of MBS with prepayment features may not increase as much as other fixed-income securities. The rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of MBS and may have the effect of shortening or extending the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase. When interest rates rise, our holdings of MBS may experience reduced returns if the owners of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated. This is generally referred to as “extension risk.”
Payment of principal and interest on some mortgage pass-through securities, though not the market value of the securities themselves, may be guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, including securities backed by Ginnie Mae, by agencies or instrumentalities of the federal government, or by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. MBS created by non-governmental issuers, including commercial banks, savings and loan institutions, private mortgage insurance companies, mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers, may be supported by various forms of insurance or guarantees including individual loan, title, pool and hazard insurance and letters of credit which may be issued by governmental entities, private insurers or the mortgage poolers.
General Information About Agency MBS
The Agency MBS that we acquire provide funds for mortgage loans made to residential homeowners. These securities generally represent interests in pools of mortgage loans made by mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings and loan institutions and other mortgage lenders. These pools of mortgage loans are assembled for sale to investors, such as us, by various government-related or private organizations.
Agency MBS differ from other forms of traditional debt securities, which normally provide for periodic payments of interest in fixed amounts with principal payments at maturity or on specified call dates. Instead, Agency MBS provide for a monthly payment, which may consist of both interest and principal. In effect, these payments are a “pass-through” of the monthly interest and scheduled and unscheduled principal payments (referred to as “prepayments”) made by the individual borrower on the mortgage loans, net of any fees paid to the issuer, servicer, or guarantor of the securities.
The investment characteristics of Agency MBS differ from those of traditional fixed-income securities. Major differences include the payment of interest and principal on the securities on a more frequent schedule (as described above) and the possibility that principal may be prepaid, without penalty, at par at any time due to prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans. These differences can result in significantly greater price and yield volatility than is the case with traditional fixed-income securities.

9



Various factors affect the rate at which mortgage prepayments occur, including changes in the level of and directional trends in housing prices, interest rates, general economic conditions, defaults on the underlying mortgages, the age of the mortgage loan, the size of the loan, the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage, the location of the property, and social and demographic conditions. Additionally, changes to GSE underwriting practices or other governmental programs could also significantly impact prepayment rates or expectations. Also, the pace at which the loans underlying our securities become seriously delinquent or are modified, and the timing of GSE repurchases of loans from our securities, can materially impact the rate of prepayments. Generally, prepayments on Agency MBS increase during periods of falling mortgage interest rates and decrease during periods of rising mortgage interest rates; however, this may not always be the case. We may reinvest principal repayments at a yield that is higher or lower than the yield on the repaid investment, thus affecting our net interest income by altering the average yield on our assets.
Payments of principal and interest on Agency MBS, although not the market value of the securities themselves, are guaranteed either by the full faith and credit of the United States, such as those issued by Ginnie Mae, or by a GSE, such as those issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Agency MBS are collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans, or FRMs, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or ARMs, and hybrid ARMs. Hybrid ARMs are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period (typically ranging from one to ten years) and, thereafter, reset at regular intervals, subject to interest rate caps. Our allocation of investments among securities collateralized by FRMs, ARMs, or hybrid ARMs depends upon our Manager’s assessment of the relative value of the securities, which is based upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, expected future prepayment trends, supply and demand, costs of financing, costs of hedging, expected future interest rate volatility, and the overall shape of the U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap yield curves.
The types of residential pass-through certificates in which we invest, or which may comprise the CMOs in which we may invest, are described below.
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
We invest in Agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are stockholder-owned corporations chartered by Congress with a public mission to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the SEC, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the U.S. Treasury, and are currently operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The U.S. Treasury has agreed to support the continuing operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with any necessary capital contributions while in conservatorship. However, the U.S. Government does not guarantee the securities, or other obligations, of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate in the secondary mortgage market. They purchase residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities from primary mortgage market institutions, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, seller/servicers, securities dealers and other investors. Through the mortgage securitization process, they package the purchased mortgage loans into guaranteed MBS for sale to investors, such as us, in the form of pass-through certificates and guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the securities or, on the underlying loans held within the securitization trust, in exchange for guarantee fees. The underlying loans must meet certain underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (referred to as “conforming loans”) and may be fixed- or adjustable-rate loans with original terms to maturity of up to 40 years.
TBA Agency MBS
We also enter into TBA Agency MBS as either a means of investing in and financing Agency MBS or as a means of disposing of or reducing our exposure to agency securities. Pursuant to TBA contracts, we agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, Agency MBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular Agency MBS to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. We also may choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these MBS out to a later date by entering into an offsetting short or long position (referred to as a “pair off”), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing a 

10



similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. This transaction is commonly referred to as a “dollar roll.” The Agency MBS purchased or sold for a forward settlement date are typically priced at a discount to agency securities for settlement in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” The price drop represents compensation to us for foregoing net interest margin (interest income less repurchase agreement financing cost). TBA Agency MBS are accounted for as derivative instruments since they do not meet the exemption allowed for a “regular way” security trade under ASC 815, as either the TBA contracts do not settle in the shortest period of time possible or we cannot assess that it is probable at inception that we will take physical delivery of the security or that we will not settle on a net basis.
Mortgage Credit Investments
Non-Agency MBS
Non-Agency MBS are securities backed by residential mortgages for which the payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of MBS. Non-Agency MBS are often referred to as “private label MBS.” Non-Agency MBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance, and they may also be bought at significant discounts. Non-Agency MBS can carry a significantly higher level of credit exposure relative to the credit exposure of Agency MBS. We may also purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement or non-investment grade instruments that absorb credit risk. We focus primarily on Non-Agency MBS where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Non-Agency MBS also include securitized non-performing loans where resolution of the loans may come from loan modifications, short sales, or foreclosures. While there is a high expectation of losses on these loans, the bonds benefit from credit enhancement and over-collateralization.
Non-Agency MBS are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or non-prime mortgage loans, which are described below:
Prime mortgage loans. Prime mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans that generally conform to the underwriting guidelines of a U.S. Government agency or a GSE but that do not carry any credit guarantee from either a U.S. Government agency or a GSE. Jumbo prime mortgage loans are prime mortgage loans that conform to such underwriting guidelines except as to loan size.
Non-prime mortgage loans. Non-prime mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans that do not meet all of the underwriting guidelines of a U.S. Government agency or a GSE. Consequently, these loans may carry higher credit risk than prime mortgage loans. Non-prime mortgage loans may allow borrowers to qualify for a mortgage loan with reduced or alternative forms of documentation. This category includes loans commonly referred to as alternative A- paper, or Alt-A, or as subprime. Alt-A mortgage loans are considered riskier than prime mortgage loans but less risky than subprime mortgage loans. They are typically characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher loan-to-value ratios and include a higher percentage of investment properties. Subprime mortgage loans are considered to be of the lowest credit quality. These loans may also include option-ARM loans, which contain a feature providing the borrower the option, within certain constraints, to make lesser payments than otherwise required by the stated interest rate for a number of years, leading to negative amortization and increased loan balances.
Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Securitization
We acquire and accumulate mortgage loans through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Anworth Mortgage Loans, Inc., as part of our investment strategy until a sufficient quantity has been accumulated for securitization. We anticipate that any mortgage loans that we would acquire and do not securitize will not constitute more than 40% of our total mortgage-related assets at any time. Despite our intentions, however, we may not be successful in securitizing these mortgage loans. As part of our due diligence process, we review and validate all appraisals.

11



Mortgage loans and other mortgage-related assets may be purchased from various suppliers of mortgage-related assets throughout the United States including savings and loans associations, banks, mortgage bankers and other mortgage lenders.
Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment Through Consolidated Securitization Trusts
We invest in residential mortgage loans held-for-investment through consolidated securitization trusts. We finance residential mortgage loans through ABS issued by the consolidated securitization trusts. The ABS which are held by unaffiliated third parties are non-recourse financing. The difference in the amount of the loans and the amount of the ABS represents our retained net interest in the loans held in the securitization trusts.
Other Mortgage-Related Investments
Mortgage Derivative Securities. We may acquire mortgage derivative securities in an amount not to exceed 10% of our total assets. Mortgage derivative securities provide for the holder to receive interest-only, principal-only or interest and principal in amounts that are disproportionate to those payable on the underlying mortgage loans. Payments on mortgage derivative securities are highly sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans. In the event of faster or slower than anticipated prepayments on these mortgage loans, the rates of return on interests in mortgage derivative securities, representing the right to receive interest-only or a disproportionately large amount of interest or interest-only derivatives, would be likely to decline or increase, respectively. Conversely, the rates of return on mortgage derivative securities, representing the right to receive principal-only or a disproportionate amount of principal or principal-only derivatives, would be likely to increase or decrease in the event of faster or slower prepayments, respectively. We may invest in inverse floaters, a class of CMOs with a coupon rate that resets in the opposite direction from the market rate of interest to which it is indexed. Any rise in the index rate, which can be caused by an increase in interest rates, causes a drop in the coupon rate of an inverse floater, while any drop in the index rate causes an increase in the coupon of an inverse floater. An inverse floater may behave like a leveraged security since its interest rate usually varies by a magnitude much greater than the magnitude of the index rate of interest. The leverage-like characteristics inherent in inverse floaters result in a greater volatility of their market prices.
We may also invest in other mortgage derivative securities, including other types that may be developed in the future.
Subordinated Interests. We may acquire subordinated interests, which are classes of MBS that are junior to other classes of the same series of MBS in the right to receive payments from the underlying mortgage loans. The subordination may be for all payment failures on the mortgage loans securing or underlying such series of mortgage securities. The subordination will not be limited to those resulting from particular types of risks, including those resulting from war, earthquake or flood, or the bankruptcy of a borrower. The subordination may be for the entire amount of the series of mortgage-related securities or may be limited in amount.
Other Mortgage-Related Assets
Other Investments. We may acquire other investments that include equity and debt securities issued by other primarily mortgage-related finance companies, interests in mortgage-related collateralized bond obligations, other subordinated interests in pools of mortgage-related assets, commercial mortgage loans and securities and residential mortgage loans other than high-credit quality mortgage loans. Although we expect that our other investments will be limited to less than 10% of total assets, we have no limit on how much of our stockholders’ equity will be allocated to other investments. There may be periods in which other investments represent a large portion of our stockholders’ equity.
Residential Real Estate
These assets consist of residential properties which we lease to tenants. Our focus is on properties in those areas that produce high occupancy and rental rates and generate long-term property appreciation.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion summarizes particular U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding our qualification and taxation as a REIT and particular U.S. federal income tax consequences resulting from the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our capital stock. This discussion is based on current law and assumes that we have qualified at all times throughout our existence, and will continue to qualify, as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The tax law upon which this discussion is based could be changed and any such change could have a retroactive effect. The following discussion is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary neither gives a detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations nor discusses all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or to particular types of stockholders which are subject to special tax rules, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations or partnerships and persons who are not citizens or residents of the U.S., stockholders that hold our stock as a hedge, part of a straddle, conversion transaction or other arrangement involving more than one position, or stockholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion assumes that you will hold our capital stock as a “capital asset” under the Code, which generally is property held for investment.
We urge you to consult with your own tax advisor regarding the specific consequences to you of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of stock in an entity electing to be taxed as a REIT, including the federal, state, local, foreign and other tax considerations of such acquisition, ownership, and disposition, and the potential changes in applicable tax laws.
General
Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, on an ongoing basis, various requirements imposed under the Code as discussed below, which relate to the nature of our gross income, the composition of our assets, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, the actual results of our operations for any particular taxable year may not satisfy these requirements.
We have made an election to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1998. We currently expect to continue operating in a manner that will permit us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. All qualification requirements for maintaining our REIT status, however, may not have been, or might not continue to be, met.

14



So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will be permitted a deduction for dividends that we pay to our stockholders. As a result, we generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is distributed to our stockholders on a current basis. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” that ordinarily results from investment in a corporation. Double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when this income is distributed. We will be required to pay federal income tax, however, as follows:

◾ | we will be required to pay tax at regular corporate rates on any undistributed “real estate investment trust taxable income,” including undistributed net capital gains;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | we may be required to pay the “alternative minimum tax” on our items of tax preference; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | if we have (a) net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, or (b) other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income. Foreclosure property is generally defined as property acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or on a lease of the property.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent that distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, they will constitute a return of capital, rather than dividend or capital gain income, and will reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in the stock with respect to which the distributions are paid and, to the extent that they exceed such basis, will be taxed in the same manner as gain from the sale of that stock. For purposes of determining whether distributions are out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, our earnings and profits will be allocated first to our preferred stock (rather than to our common stock) with the result that distributions with respect to our preferred stock are more likely to be treated as dividends than as return of capital or a distribution in excess of basis. Calculations of corporate earnings and profits are complex and it is possible that distributions expected to be a return of capital may subsequently be determined to be taxable distributions of earnings and profits.

Currently, dividends paid by regular C corporations to stockholders other than corporations are generally taxed at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains, which is currently a maximum of 20%, subject to certain limitations. Because we are a REIT, however, our dividends, including dividends paid on our stock, including shares of our preferred stock, generally will continue to be taxed at regular ordinary income tax rates, except in limited circumstances, including dividend distributions allocable to distributions we have received from a taxable REIT subsidiary or other taxable corporation; provided, however, that all such distributions, other than distributions which are taxable as capital gain dividends or traceable to distributions from a taxable REIT subsidiary, as are received by a pass-through entity or an individual, became eligible for a 20% deduction from gross income starting in 2018 under the tax laws. This eligibility for a 20% deduction will expire in 2025.
 We will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. Prohibited transactions are, in general, sales or other taxable dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. While the Code contains certain safe harbor provisions to avoid the application of this 100% tax, outside of the safe harbor, the determination of whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. No assurance can be given that any particular property in which we hold a direct or indirect interest will not be treated as property held for sale to customers, or that we can comply with certain safe harbor provisions of the Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax will not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a taxable REIT subsidiary or other taxable corporation, although such income will be taxed to the corporation at regular corporate tax rates.

If we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be subject to a tax equal to the greater of (i) the amount by which 75% of our gross income exceeds the amount qualifying under the 75% gross income test described below, and (ii) the amount by which 95% of our gross income exceeds the amount qualifying under the 95% gross income test described below, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

15



In the event a more than de minimis failure of any of the asset tests occurs in a taxable year, as long as the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and we dispose of the assets or otherwise comply with the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify such failure, we may pay a tax equal to the greater of $50 thousand or 35% of the net income from the non-qualifying assets during the period in which we failed to satisfy any of the asset tests in lieu of having our qualification as a REIT terminated.

In the event of a failure to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification occurring in a taxable year, other than the gross income tests and the asset tests, as long as such failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, we will be required to pay a penalty of $50 thousand for each such failure in order to maintain our REIT qualification.

We will be required to pay a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the amounts actually distributed if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of:


◾ | 85% of our real estate investment trust ordinary income for the year;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | 95% of our real estate investment trust capital gain net income for the year; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any undistributed taxable income from prior periods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

This distribution requirement is in addition to, and different from, the distribution requirements discussed below in the section entitled “Annual Distribution Requirements.”

We may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gain. In that case, if we so elect, a U.S. stockholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain (to the extent that we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder) and would receive a credit or refund of its proportionate share of the tax we paid. The basis of the stockholder’s shares is increased by the amount of the undistributed long-term capital gain (less the amount of capital gains tax paid by the REIT) includable by the stockholder.

If we own a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit (which we refer to as a “REMIC”), we will be taxable at the highest corporate rate on the portion of any excess inclusion income that we derive from the REMIC residual interests equal to the percentage of our stock that is held by “disqualified” organizations. Although the law is unclear, similar rules may apply if we own an equity interest in a taxable mortgage pool. To the extent that we own a REMIC residual interest or an interest in a taxable mortgage pool through a taxable REIT subsidiary, we will not be subject to this tax, although our taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to corporate income tax on all of its income, including any income derived from a residual interest in a REMIC or an interest in a taxable mortgage pool. A “disqualified organization” includes: 

◾ | the United States of America;
--+------------------------------


◾ | any state or political subdivision of the United States of America;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any foreign government;
--+------------------------


◾ | any international organization;
--+--------------------------------


◾ | any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any other tax-exempt organization other than a farmers’ cooperative described in Section 521 of the Code that is exempt both from income taxation and from taxation under the unrelated business taxable income provisions of the Code; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any rural electrical or telephone cooperative.
--+-----------------------------------------------

16



If we acquire any asset from a corporation which is or has been taxed as a C corporation under the Code in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the C corporation and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the five-year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset, then we will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of:


◾ | the fair market value of the asset, over
--+-----------------------------------------


◾ | our adjusted basis in the asset,
--+---------------------------------


◾ | in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We may be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with any taxable REIT subsidiaries (defined below) to the extent that such transactions are not conducted on a basis that is consistent with arm’s length terms.

In addition, notwithstanding our REIT status, we may also have to pay certain state and local income taxes, because not all states and localities treat REITs in the same manner as they are treated for federal income tax purposes.

Requirements for Qualification as a REIT

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association:

1.                        that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

2.                        that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence beneficial ownership;

3.                        that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for Code Sections 856 through 859;

4.                        that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of the Code;

5.                        that is beneficially owned by 100 or more persons; 

6.                        not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals, including specified entities, at all times during the last half of each taxable year;

7.                        that meets other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions; and

8.                        that elects to be a REIT or has made such election for a previous taxable year and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, that must be met in order to elect and retain REIT status.

The Code provides that all of the first four conditions stated above must be met during the entire taxable year and that the fifth condition must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of twelve months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months. The fifth and sixth conditions do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made to be taxed as a REIT.

For purposes of the sixth condition, certain specified types of trusts and tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, except that a “look-through” exception generally applies with respect to pension funds.

Stock Ownership Tests

As noted above, our stock must be beneficially held by at least 100 persons (which we refer to as the “100 Stockholder Rule”), and no more than 50% of the value of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or 

17



fewer individuals at any time during the last half of the taxable year (which we refer to as the “5/50 Rule”). We are required to solicit information from certain of our record stockholders to verify actual stock ownership levels and our charter provides for restrictions regarding the transfer of our stock in order to aid in meeting the stock ownership requirements. If we were to fail either of the stock ownership tests, we would generally be disqualified from our REIT status. However, if we comply with regulatory rules pursuant to which we are required to send annual letters to holders of our stock requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock, and we do not know, or exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the 5/50 Rule, then we will be treated as having met the 5/50 Rule. 
​
Income Tests
We must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a REIT:


◾ | We must derive, directly or indirectly, at least 75% of our gross income, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, from specified real estate sources, including rental income, interest on obligations (including certain MBS) that are secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, gain from the disposition of “qualified real estate assets” (i.e., interests in real property, mortgages secured by real property or interests in real property, and certain other assets), income from certain types of temporary investments, amounts, such as commitment fees, received in consideration for entering into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property, and income derived from a REMIC in proportion to the real estate assets held by the REMIC, unless at least 95% of the REMIC’s assets are real estate assets (in which case, all of the income derived from the REMIC) (which we refer to as the “75% gross income test”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | We must derive at least 95% of our gross income, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, from (a) the sources of income that satisfy the 75% gross income test, (b) dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or (c) any combination of the foregoing (which we refer to as the “95% gross income test”).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross income from servicing loans for third parties is not qualifying income for purposes of either gross income test. Any gross income from our sale of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is excluded from both the numerator and the denominator in both income tests (but is subject to a 100% tax as a prohibited transaction unless certain safe harbor provisions are satisfied). Income and gain from certain transactions that we enter into to hedge indebtedness incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, and that are clearly and timely identified as such, are excluded from both the numerator and denominator for purposes of both gross income tests.

For purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, a REIT is deemed to have earned a proportionate share of the income earned by any partnership, or any limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, in which it owns an interest, which share is determined by reference to the REIT’s capital interest in such entity, and is deemed to have earned all of the income earned by any qualified REIT subsidiary (in general, a 100%-owned corporate subsidiary of a REIT) or any other entity that is disregarded as separated from the parent REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Interest earned by a REIT ordinarily does not qualify as income meeting the 75% or 95% gross income tests if the determination of all or some of the amount of interest depends on the income or profits of any person. Interest will not be disqualified from meeting such tests, however, solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.

The following paragraphs discuss in more detail the specific application of the gross income tests to us.

Interest. The term “interest,” as defined for purposes of both gross income tests, generally excludes any amount that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, interest generally includes the following:

◾ | an amount that is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




◾ | an amount that is based on the income or profits of a debtor as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property and only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying “rents from real property” if received directly by a REIT.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a loan contains a provision that entitles a REIT to a percentage of the borrower’s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property’s value as of a specific date, income attributable to that loan provision will generally be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan, which normally constitutes qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. 
Interest on debt secured by a mortgage on real property or on interests in real property, including, for this purpose, discount points, prepayment penalties, loan assumption fees and late payment charges that are not compensation for services, generally is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date the REIT agreed to originate or acquire the loan, a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. The portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property—that is, the amount by which the loan exceeds the value of the real estate that is security for the loan. For purposes of these rules, ancillary personal property that secures a mortgage loan and has a value not in excess of 15% of the total value of the collateral (i.e., of the real property together with the personal property) is treated as real property.

The interest, original issue discount and market discount income that we receive from our mortgage loans and certain MBS (including Agency MBS and interests in REMICs) generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. However, as discussed above, if the fair market value of the real estate securing any of our loans is less than the principal amount of the loan, a portion of the income from that loan will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test but not the 75% gross income test.

Fee Income. We may receive various fees in connection with originating mortgage loans. The fees will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% income tests if they are received in consideration for entering into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property and the fees are not determined based on the borrower’s income or profits. Therefore, commitment fees will generally be qualifying income for purposes of the income tests. Other fees, such as fees received for servicing loans for third parties, are not qualifying income for purposes of either income test.
Dividends. Our share of any dividends received from any corporation (including any of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, but excluding any REIT) in which we own an equity interest will qualify for purposes of the 95% gross income test but not for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Our share of any dividends received from any other REIT in which we own an equity interest will be qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.
Rents from Real Property. Rents that we receive with respect to real property will qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT described above provided that the following conditions are met: 


◾ | First, the amount of rent must not be based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from rents from real property solely by reason of being based on fixed percentages of receipts or sales;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Second, rents we receive from a “related party tenant” will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests unless the tenant is a taxable REIT subsidiary, at least 90% of the property is leased to unrelated tenants and the rent paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary is substantially comparable to the rent paid by the unrelated tenants for comparable space. A tenant is a related party tenant if the REIT, or an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of the REIT, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




◾ | Third, if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to the personal property will not qualify as rents from real property; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Fourth, we generally must not operate or manage our real property or furnish or render services to our tenants, other than through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive revenue. However, we may provide services directly to tenants if the services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not considered to be provided for the tenants’ convenience. In addition, we may provide a minimal amount of “non-customary” services to the tenants of a property, other than through an independent contractor, as long as our income from the services does not exceed 1% of our income from the related property. Furthermore, we may own up to 100% of the stock of a taxable REIT subsidiary, which may provide customary and non-customary services to tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hedging Transactions. From time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swap agreements, caps and floors, options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts. Income and gain from certain “hedging transactions” will be excluded from gross income for purposes of both the 95% gross income test and the 75% gross income test. A “hedging transaction” includes any transaction entered into in the normal course of our trade or business primarily to manage the risk of interest rate, changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets. We will be required to clearly identify any such hedging transaction before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated or entered into, and to meet certain other requirements. To the extent that any of our hedging transactions do not meet these requirements, or if we hedge for other purposes, or to the extent that a portion of our mortgage loans is not secured by “real estate assets” (as described below under “Asset Tests”), or in other situations, the income from those transactions could be treated as income that does not qualify for purposes of one or both of the gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.
Prohibited Transactions. As discussed above, a REIT will incur a 100% tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that the REIT holds primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. We believe that our assets generally will not be held primarily for sale to customers and that sales of our assets will not be considered to be in the ordinary course of our business. Whether a REIT holds an asset “primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” depends, however, on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time, including those related to a particular asset. When practicable, we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe-harbor provisions in the federal income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction or otherwise structure our sale transactions so as to minimize this risk.
Foreclosure Property. We will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, less expenses directly connected with the production of that income. However, gross income from foreclosure property will qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Foreclosure property is any real property, including interests in real property, and any personal property incident to such real property: 
​

◾ | that is acquired by a REIT as the result of the REIT having bid on such property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was a default or default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the REIT at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | for which the REIT makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20



Permitted foreclosure property income also includes foreign currency gain that is attributable to otherwise permitted income from foreclosure property. Such foreign currency gain also is included as foreclosure property income for purposes of any tax on such income.

However, a REIT will not be considered to have foreclosed on a property where the REIT takes control of the property as a mortgagee-in-possession and cannot receive any profit or sustain any loss except as a creditor of the mortgagor. Property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired the property or longer if an extension is granted by the Secretary of the Treasury. This grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day:


◾ | on which a lease is entered into for the property that, by its terms, will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | on which any construction takes place on the property, other than completion of a building or any other improvement, where more than 10% of the construction was completed before default became imminent; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | which is more than 90 days after the day on which the REIT acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business which is conducted by the REIT other than through an independent contractor from whom the REIT itself does not derive or receive any income.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failure to Satisfy Gross Income Tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we nevertheless may qualify as a REIT for that year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the federal income tax laws. Those relief provisions will be available if:

◾ | our failure to meet those tests is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | following such failure for any taxable year, a schedule of the sources of our income is filed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We cannot predict, however, whether in all circumstances we would qualify for the relief provisions. In addition, as discussed above, even if the relief provisions apply, we would incur a tax equal to the amount that our gross income fails to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as applicable, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

Foreign Investment and Exchange Gains

A REIT must be a U.S. domestic entity, but it is permitted to hold foreign real estate or other foreign-based assets, provided that the 75% and 95% income tests and other requirements for REIT qualification are met. A REIT that holds foreign real estate or other foreign-based assets may have foreign currency exchange gain under the foreign currency transaction tax rules. Foreign currency exchange gain originally was not explicitly included in the statutory definitions of qualifying income for purposes of the 75% and 95% income tests until a statutory change, although the IRS issued guidance that allowed foreign currency gain to be treated as qualified income in certain circumstances. The statutory change excludes certain foreign currency gain from the computation of qualifying income for purposes of the 75% income test or the 95% income test, respectively. The exclusion is solely for purposes of the computations under these tests.

The statutory change defines two new categories of income for purposes of the exclusion rules: “real estate foreign exchange gain” and “passive foreign exchange gain.” Real estate foreign exchange gain is excluded from gross income for purposes of both the 75% and the 95% income tests. Passive foreign exchange gain is excluded for purposes of the 95% income test but is included in gross income and treated as non-qualifying income, to the extent that it is not real estate foreign exchange gain, for purposes of the 75% income test.

21



Real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain which is attributable to: (i) any item of income qualifying for the numerator for the 75% income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes certain foreign currency gains attributable to certain “qualified business units” of the REIT.

Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange and, in addition, includes foreign currency gain which is attributable to: (i) any item of income or gain included in the numerator for the 95% income test, (ii) acquisition or ownership of obligations other than described in the preceding paragraph; (iii) becoming the obligor under obligations other than described in the preceding paragraph; and (iv) any other foreign currency gain to be determined by the IRS.

Notwithstanding the foregoing rules, except in the case of certain income excluded under the hedging rules, foreign currency exchange gain derived from engaging in dealing, or substantial and regular trading, in certain securities constitutes gross income that does not qualify under either the 75% or 95% income test.

Asset Tests

To qualify as a REIT, we also must satisfy the following asset tests at the end of each quarter of each taxable year:

First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of:


◾ | cash or cash items, including certain receivables;
--+---------------------------------------------------


◾ | government securities;
--+-----------------------


◾ | interests in real property, including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | interests in mortgage loans secured by real property (together with ancillary personal property that does not exceed 15% of the total collateral value), including, in general, our Agency MBS and almost all of our Non-Agency MBS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | stock in other REITs;
--+----------------------


◾ | debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs;
--+---------------------------------------------------


◾ | investments in stock or debt instruments during the one-year period following our receipt of new capital that we raise through equity offerings or public offerings of debt with at least a five-year term; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | regular or residual interests in a REMIC. However, if less than 95% of the assets of a REMIC consist of assets that are qualifying real estate-related assets under the federal income tax laws, determined as if we held such assets, we will be treated as holding directly our proportionate share of the assets of such REMIC.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The term “cash” for purposes of the REIT asset qualification rules is defined to include foreign currency if the REIT or its “qualified business unit” uses such foreign currency as its functional currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or the “qualified business unit” giving rise to income in the numerator for the 75% or 95% income tests, or directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying for the numerator in the 75% assets test, and is not held in connection with a trade or business of trading or dealing in certain securities.

Second, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities (other than those included in the preceding category).

22



Third, not more than 20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Fourth, except with respect to a taxable REIT subsidiary and securities that qualify for purposes of the 75% test described above, (a) not more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any one issuer, (b) we may not hold securities possessing more than 10% of the total voting power of the outstanding securities of any one issuer and (c) we may not hold securities having a value of more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.

For purposes of the second and third asset tests, the term “securities” does not include stock in another REIT, equity or debt securities of a qualified REIT subsidiary or taxable REIT subsidiary, mortgage loans that constitute real estate assets, or equity interests in a partnership.

For purposes of the 10% value test, the term “securities” does not include:


◾ | “Straight debt” securities, which is defined as a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in money if (i) the debt is not convertible, directly or indirectly, into stock, and (ii) the interest rate and interest payment dates are not contingent on profits, the borrower’s discretion, or similar factors. “Straight debt” securities do not include any securities issued by a partnership or a corporation in which we or any controlled taxable REIT subsidiary (i.e., a taxable REIT subsidiary in which we own directly or indirectly more than 50% of the voting power or value of the stock) hold non-“straight debt” securities that have aggregate value of more than 1% of the issuer’s outstanding securities. However, “straight debt” securities include debt subject to the following contingencies:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | a contingency relating to the time of payment of interest or principal, as long as either (i) there is no change to the effective yield of the debt obligation other than a change to the annual yield that does not exceed the greater of 0.25% or 5% of the annual yield, or (ii) neither the aggregate issue price nor the aggregate face amount of the issuer’s debt obligations held by us exceeds $1 million and no more than 12 months of unaccrued interest on the debt obligations can be required to be prepaid; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | a contingency relating to the time or amount of payment upon a default or prepayment of a debt obligation, as long as the contingency is consistent with customary commercial practice.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Any loan to an individual or an estate;
--+----------------------------------------


◾ | Any “section 467 rental agreement” other than an agreement with a related party tenant;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Any obligation to pay “rents from real property”;
--+--------------------------------------------------


◾ | Certain securities issued by governmental entities;
--+----------------------------------------------------


◾ | Any security issued by a REIT;
--+-------------------------------


◾ | Any debt instrument of an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Any debt instrument of an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes not described in the preceding bullet points if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income, excluding income from prohibited transaction, is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above in “Income Tests.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The asset tests described above are based on our gross assets. For federal income tax purposes, we will be treated as owning both the loans we hold directly and, in general, any loans that we would securitize through non-REMIC debt securitizations. Although we will have a partially offsetting obligation with respect to the securities issued pursuant to 

23



securitizations, these offsetting obligations will generally not reduce the gross assets we are considered to own for purposes of the asset tests.

We believe that a substantial majority of the mortgage loans and MBS that we will own will be qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. However, certain of our investments, such as certain non-agency MBS that are not interests in REMICs, and certain derivative positions in MBS such as interests in “to be announced” Agency MBS and dollar roll transactions, may not qualify for purposes of the asset tests. Moreover, for purposes of these rules, if the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan (together with that of any ancillary personal property which serves as collateral), a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset under the federal income tax laws. 
Revenue Procedures 2011-16 and 2014-51 discuss the modification of a mortgage loan (or an interest therein) that is held by a REIT in which the modification was occasioned by either a default on the loan or a modification that satisfies both of the following conditions: (a) based on all the facts and circumstances, the REIT or servicer of the loan (the “pre-modified loan”) reasonably believes that there is a significant risk of default of the pre-modified loan upon maturity of the loan or at an earlier date, and (b) based on all the facts and circumstances, the REIT or servicer reasonably believes that the modified loan presents a substantially reduced risk of default, as compared with the pre-modified loan. Revenue Procedures 2011-16 and 2014-51 provide that a REIT may treat a modification of a mortgage loan described therein as not being a new commitment to make or purchase a loan for purposes of apportioning interest on that loan between interest with respect to real property or other interest. The modification will also not be treated as a prohibited transaction. Further, with respect to the REIT asset test, the IRS will not challenge the REIT’s treatment of a loan as being in part a “real estate asset” if the REIT treats the loan as being a real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the value of the loan as determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.856-3(a), or (b) the loan value of the real property securing the loan as determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.856-5(c) and Revenue Procedures 2011-16 and 2014-51.

We will monitor the status of our assets for purposes of the various asset tests and will seek to manage our investment portfolio to comply at all times with such tests. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in this effort. In this regard, to determine our compliance with these requirements, we will need to estimate the value of the real estate securing our mortgage loans at various times. Although we will seek to be prudent in making these estimates, there can be no assurances that the IRS might not disagree with these determinations and assert that a lower value is applicable. If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, we will not lose our REIT status if:


◾ | we satisfied the asset tests at the end of the preceding calendar quarter; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets and was not wholly or partly caused by the acquisition of one or more non-qualifying assets, or solely by a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used to value a foreign asset.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we did not satisfy the condition described in the second item, above, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose.

In the event that, at the end of any calendar quarter, we violate the asset tests described above, we will not lose our REIT status if (i) the failure is de minimis (up to the lesser of 1% of our assets or $10 million) and (ii) we dispose of assets or otherwise comply with the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify such failure. In the event of a more than de minimis failure of any of the asset tests, as long as the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, we will not lose our REIT status if (i) we dispose of assets or otherwise comply with the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identify such failure and (ii) pay a tax equal to the greater of $50 thousand or 35% of the net income from the non-qualifying assets during the period in which we failed to satisfy the asset tests.

24



We currently believe that the securities and other assets that we expect to hold will satisfy the foregoing asset test requirements. However, no independent appraisals will be obtained to support our conclusions as to the value of our assets and securities, or in many cases, the real estate collateral for the mortgage loans that we hold. Moreover, the values of some assets may not be susceptible to a precise determination. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our ownership of securities and other assets violates one or more of the asset tests applicable to REITs.

Annual Distribution Requirements

Each taxable year, we must distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends and deemed distributions of retained capital gain, to our stockholders in an aggregate amount at least equal to:

◾ | the sum of:
--+------------


◾ | 90% of our “REIT taxable income,” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain or loss, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | 90% of our after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the sum of certain items of excess non-cash income.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We must pay such distributions in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if we declare the distribution before we timely file our federal income tax return for the year and pay the distribution on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration. In addition, dividends declared in October, November or December payable to stockholders of record in such month are deemed received by stockholders on December 31 and to have been paid on December 31 if actually paid in January of the following year. See below under “Distributions Generally.”

We will pay the federal income tax on taxable income, including net capital gain, that we do not distribute to stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during a calendar year, or by the end of January following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, at least the sum of:


◾ | 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year;
--+-----------------------------------------------


◾ | 95% of our REIT capital gain income for such year; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,
--+-----------------------------------------------------

we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute. We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain we receive in a taxable year (see the section entitled “Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders”). If we so elect, we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the 4% nondeductible excise tax described above. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements and to not incur corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may experience timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our REIT taxable income. Possible examples of those timing differences include the following:


◾ | Because we may deduct capital losses only to the extent of our capital gains, we may have taxable income that exceeds our economic income;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




◾ | We will recognize taxable income in advance of the related cash flow if any of our mortgage loans or MBS are deemed to have original issue discount. We generally must accrue original issue discount based on a constant yield method that takes into account projected prepayments but that defers taking into account credit losses until they are actually incurred;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | We may recognize taxable market discount income when we receive the proceeds from the disposition of, or principal payments on, loans that have a stated redemption price at maturity that is greater than our tax basis in those loans, although such proceeds often will be used to make non-deductible principal payments on related borrowings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | We may recognize taxable income without receiving a corresponding cash distribution if we foreclose on or make a significant modification to a loan to the extent that the fair market value of the underlying property or the principal amount of the modified loan, as applicable, exceeds our basis in the original loan; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | We may recognize phantom taxable income from any residual interests in REMICs or from retained ownership interests in mortgage loans that are used in certain securitization structures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although several types of non-cash income are excluded in determining the annual distribution requirement, we will incur corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax with respect to those non-cash income items if we do not distribute those items on a current basis. As a result of the foregoing, we may have less cash than is necessary to distribute all of our taxable income and thereby avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income. In such a situation, we may need to borrow funds or issue additional common stock or preferred stock.

Under certain circumstances, we may be able to correct a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to our stockholders in a later year. We may include such deficiency dividends in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends.

Recordkeeping Requirements

We must maintain certain records in order to qualify as a REIT. In addition, to avoid a monetary penalty, we must request, on an annual basis, information from our stockholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of our outstanding stock. We intend to comply with these requirements.
Failure to Qualify

If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification, other than the gross income tests and the asset tests, we could avoid disqualification if our failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50 thousand for each such failure. In addition, there are relief provisions for a failure of the gross income tests and asset tests as described in “Income Tests” and “Asset Tests.”

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and no relief provision applies, we would be subject to federal income tax and any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. In calculating our taxable income in a year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be able to deduct amounts distributed to our stockholders. In fact, we would not be required to distribute any amounts to stockholders in that year. In such event, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income. Subject to certain limitations of the federal income tax laws, corporate stockholders might be eligible for the dividends received deduction and domestic non-corporate stockholders may be eligible for the reduced federal income tax rate of 20% on qualified dividends. Unless we qualified for relief under specific statutory provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. We cannot predict whether, in all circumstances, we would qualify for such statutory relief.

26



Qualified REIT Subsidiaries

A qualified REIT subsidiary (which we refer to as a “QRS”) is any corporation in which we own 100% of the outstanding stock and for which no election has been made to classify it as a taxable REIT subsidiary. The separate existence of a QRS is disregarded for federal income tax purposes. As such, assets, liabilities and income of a QRS would generally be treated as our assets, liabilities and income for purposes of each of the above REIT qualification tests. In February 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned QRS, Anworth Properties, Inc., which commenced operations in March 2014. In August 2017, we incorporated another wholly-owned QRS, Anworth Mortgage Loans, Inc., which commenced operations in October 2018. Our subsidiaries may own, from time to time, REIT-qualifying assets, such as certain types of mortgage assets and rental real estate assets.
Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

A taxable REIT subsidiary is any corporation in which we own stock (directly or indirectly) and that we and such corporation jointly elect to classify as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A taxable REIT subsidiary is not subject to the REIT asset, income and distribution requirements, nor is its assets, liabilities or income treated as our assets, liabilities or income for purposes of each of the above REIT qualification tests. We have incorporated Anworth Property Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary which we intend will be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, although it has not yet commenced operations. Our taxable REIT subsidiary will provide an entity through which we may participate in various activities that might otherwise have adverse tax consequences if conducted directly by a REIT or through a QRS. Unlike a REIT, a taxable REIT subsidiary pays standard corporate taxes on its income. Examples of activities in which a taxable REIT subsidiary might engage include: sales of assets in the ordinary course of business that would be a prohibited transaction if sold by the parent REIT; certain securitization activities; and certain service activities (including management of properties owned by third parties and non-customary services to real estate tenants). We generally intend to make a taxable REIT subsidiary election with respect to any other corporation in which we acquire securities constituting more than 10% by vote or value of such corporation and that is not a QRS. However, the aggregate value of all of our taxable REIT subsidiaries must be limited to 20% of the total value of our assets.

We may be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are not on an arm’s length basis. We intend for the terms of any transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary to be consistent with arm’s length terms.

We generally expect to derive any income from any taxable REIT subsidiaries in the form of dividends. Such dividends are not real estate source income for purposes of the 75% income test, although they will qualify for purposes of the 95% test. Therefore, when aggregated with our non-real estate source income, such dividends must not exceed 25% of our gross income in any year. We intend to monitor the value of our investment in, and the distributions from, our taxable REIT subsidiaries to ensure compliance with all applicable REIT income and asset tests in the event that we establish any taxable REIT subsidiaries.

Taxable REIT subsidiaries are generally subject to corporate level tax on their net income and will generally be able to distribute only net after-tax earnings to their stockholders, including us, as dividend distributions. Any dividends that we pay which are attributable to dividends received by us from taxable REIT subsidiaries can qualify for the 20% tax rate on qualified dividends in the hands of our stockholders that are not corporations.

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders

For purposes of the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term “U.S. stockholder” means a holder of our stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:


◾ | a citizen or resident of the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------


◾ | a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes), partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof or in the District of Columbia, unless Treasury regulations provide otherwise;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27




◾ | an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | a trust (i) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions Generally

Distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, other than capital gain dividends, will generally be taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income; provided, however, that all such distributions, other than distributions which are taxable as capital gain dividends or traceable to distributions from a taxable REIT subsidiary, as are received by a pass-through entity or an individual, became eligible for a 20% deduction from gross income starting in 2018 under the tax laws. This eligibility for a 20% deduction will expire in 2025. Provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT, dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to U.S. stockholders that are corporations. To the extent that we make distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a tax-free return of capital to each U.S. stockholder and will reduce the adjusted tax basis which each U.S. stockholder has in our stock by the amount of the distribution, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of a U.S. stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in its stock will be taxable as capital gain and will be taxable as long-term capital gain if the stock has been held for more than one year. If we declare a dividend in October, November, or December of any calendar year which is payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually pay the dividend during January of the following calendar year, the dividend is deemed to be paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31st of the previous year, but only to the extent we have any remaining undistributed earnings and profits (as computed under the Code) as of December 31st. Any portion of this distribution in excess of our previously undistributed earnings and profits as of December 31st should be treated as a distribution to our stockholders in the following calendar year for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stockholders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Ordinary dividends to a U.S. stockholder generally will not be eligible for the favorable tax rates (currently 20% maximum rate) for “qualified dividend income.” However, the 20% tax rate for “qualified dividend income” will apply to our ordinary REIT dividends that are attributable to (i) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations such as a taxable REIT subsidiary, and (ii) any income on which we have paid a corporate income tax.
Cost Basis Reporting

New federal income tax information reporting rules may apply to certain transactions in our shares acquired through our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Where such rules apply, the “cost basis” calculated for the shares involved will be reported to the IRS and to you. For “cost basis” reporting purposes, you may identify by lot the shares that you transfer or that are redeemed, but if you do not timely notify us of your election, we will identify the shares that are transferred or redeemed on a “first in/first out” basis. The shares in our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan are also eligible for the “average cost” basis method, should you so elect.

Brokers that are required to report the gross proceeds from a sale of shares on Form 1099-B are generally required to report the customer’s adjusted basis in the shares and whether any gain or loss with respect to the shares is long-term or short-term. In some cases, there may be alternative methods of determining the basis in shares that are disposed of, in which case a broker will apply a default method of its choosing if the investor does not indicate which method it chooses to have applied.
​
Capital Gain Distributions

Distributions designated by us as capital gain dividends will be taxable to U.S. stockholders as capital gain income. We can designate distributions as capital gain dividends to the extent of our net capital gain for the taxable year of the distribution. This capital gain income will generally be taxable to non-corporate U.S. stockholders at a 20% or 25% rate based on the characteristics of the asset we sold that produced the gain. U.S. stockholders that are corporations may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.

28



Retention of Net Capital Gains

We may elect to retain, rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend, our net capital gains. If we were to make this election, we would pay tax on such retained capital gains. In such a case, if we so elect, our stockholders would:

◾ | include their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gains in their taxable income;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | receive a credit for their proportionate share of the tax paid by us in respect of such net capital gain; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | increase the adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between the amount of their share of our undistributed net capital gain and their share of the tax paid by us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passive Activity Losses, Investment Interest Limitations and Other Considerations of Holding Our Stock

Distributions that we make and gains arising from the sale or exchange of our stock by a U.S. stockholder will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. stockholders will not be able to apply any “passive losses” against income or gains relating to our stock. Distributions by us, to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital, generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the limitations under the Code on the deductibility of investment interest expense. Further, if we, or a portion of our assets, were to be treated as a taxable mortgage pool, or if we hold a residual interest in a REMIC, any resultant excess inclusion income that we derive which is allocated to you could not be offset by any losses or other deductions you may have.

Dispositions of Stock and Warrants

A U.S. stockholder or U.S. warrant holder that sells or disposes of our stock or warrants will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash or the fair market value of any property the stockholder or warrant holder receives on the sale or other disposition and the stockholder’s or warrant holder’s adjusted tax basis in the stock or warrants, as applicable. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder or warrant holder has held the stock or warrants for more than one year. In general, any loss recognized by a U.S. stockholder or warrant holder upon the sale or other disposition of our stock or warrants that the stockholder or warrant holder has held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent the stockholder or warrant holder received distributions from us which were required to be treated as long-term capital gains. All or a portion of any loss that a U.S. stockholder or warrant holder realizes upon a taxable disposition of our stock or warrants may be disallowed if the stockholder purchases other stock within 30 days before or after the disposition.
​
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

We report to our U.S. stockholders and the IRS the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year and the amount of any tax withheld. Under the backup withholding rules, a stockholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid and redemption proceeds unless the holder is a corporation or comes within other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact or provides a taxpayer identification number or social security number certifying as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A U.S. stockholder that does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number or social security number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. A U.S. stockholder can meet this requirement by providing us with a correct, properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9 or a substantially similar form. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the stockholder’s income tax liability, if any, and otherwise be refundable. In addition, we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions made to any stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status.

29



Medicare Tax

Certain U.S. stockholders who are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on dividends, interest and certain other investment income, including capital gains from the sale or disposition of our stock.
​
Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders

The IRS has ruled that amounts distributed as a dividend by a REIT will be excluded from the calculation of unrelated business taxable income (which we refer to as “UBTI”) when received by a tax-exempt entity. Based on that ruling, provided that a tax-exempt stockholder has not held our stock as “debt financed property” within the meaning of the Code, i.e., property, the acquisition, or holding of which is financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt U.S. stockholder, the stock is not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business, and we do not hold a residual interest in a REMIC that gives rise to “excess inclusion” income, as defined in Section 860E of the Code, dividend income on our stock and income from the sale of our stock should not be unrelated business taxable income to a tax-exempt stockholder. However, if we or a pool of our assets were to be treated as a “taxable mortgage pool,” a portion of the dividends paid to a tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to tax as unrelated business taxable income. Although we do not believe that we, or any portion of our assets, will be treated as a taxable mortgage pool, no assurance can be given that the IRS might not successfully maintain that such a taxable mortgage pool exists.

For tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) and (c)(20) of the Code, respectively, income from an investment in our stock will constitute unrelated business taxable income unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for certain purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our stock. Any prospective and current investors should consult their tax advisors concerning these “set aside” and reserve requirements.

Notwithstanding the above, however, a substantial portion of the dividends that a tax-exempt stockholder receives may constitute UBTI if we are treated as a “pension-held REIT” and the stockholder is a pension trust which:


◾ | is described in Section 401(a) of the Code; and
--+------------------------------------------------


◾ | holds more than 10%, by value, of the interests in the REIT.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Tax-exempt pension funds that are described in Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code are referred to below as “qualified trusts.”

A REIT is a “pension-held REIT” if: 

◾ | it would not have qualified as a REIT but for the fact that Section 856(h)(3) of the Code provides that stock owned by a qualified trust shall be treated, for purposes of the 5/50 Rule, described above, as owned by the beneficiaries of the trust, rather than by the trust itself; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | either at least one qualified trust holds more than 25%, by value, of the interests in the REIT, or one or more qualified trusts, each of which owns more than 10%, by value, of the interests in the REIT, holds in the aggregate more than 50%, by value, of the interests in the REIT.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The percentage of any REIT dividend treated as unrelated business taxable income is equal to the ratio of: 

◾ | the unrelated business taxable income earned by the REIT, less directly related expenses, treating the REIT as if it were a qualified trust and therefore subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income, to
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the total gross income, less directly related expenses, of the REIT.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

30



 A de minimis exception applies where the percentage is less than 5% for any year. As a result of the limitations on the transfer and ownership of stock contained in our charter, we do not expect to be classified as a “pension-held REIT.”
​
Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders

The rules governing federal income taxation of “non-U.S. stockholders” are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of these rules. “Non-U.S. stockholders” means beneficial owners of shares of our stock that are not U.S. stockholders (as such term is defined in the discussion above under the heading entitled “Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders”).

PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT NON-U.S. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX LAWS WITH REGARD TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK AND OUR ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST, INCLUDING ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

Distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests, and that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or retained capital gains, will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. These distributions will generally be subject to a withholding tax equal to 30% of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax. However, if income from an investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. stockholder generally will be subject to federal income tax at graduated rates on a net basis in the same manner as U.S. stockholders are taxed with respect to those distributions and also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation. We expect to withhold tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any distributions made to a non-U.S. stockholder unless:

◾ | a lower treaty rate applies and any required form, for example IRS Form W-8BEN, evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed by the non-U.S. stockholder with us; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any portion of the dividends paid to non-U.S. stockholders that is treated as excess inclusion income will not be eligible for exemption from the 30% withholding tax or a reduced treaty rate.

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to non-U.S. stockholders to the extent that these distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholder’s stock, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of that stock. To the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non-U.S. stockholder’s stock, these distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non-U.S. stockholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of its stock, as described below. Because it generally cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution may be in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, the entire amount of any distribution normally will be subject to withholding at the same rate as a dividend. However, amounts so withheld are creditable against U.S. tax liability, if any, or refundable by the IRS to the extent that the distribution is subsequently determined to be in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. We are also required to withhold 15% of any distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if our stock is a U.S. real property interest and if we are not a domestically controlled REIT, as discussed below. Consequently, although we intend to generally withhold at a rate of 30% on the entire amount of any distribution to a non-U.S. stockholder, to the extent that we do not do so, any portion of a distribution not subject to withholding at a rate of 30% may be subject to withholding at a rate of 15%.

31



Distributions attributable to our capital gains which are not attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest generally will not be subject to income taxation unless (1) investment in our stock is effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s U.S. trade or business (or, if an income tax treaty applies, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-U.S. stockholder), in which case the non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to such gain (except that a corporate non-U.S. stockholder may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax), or (2) the non-U.S. stockholder is a non-resident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are satisfied, in which case the non-resident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, distributions that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest, which includes some interests in real property, but generally does not include an interest solely as a creditor in mortgage loans or MBS, will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder under the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (which we refer to as “FIRPTA”). Under FIRPTA, distributions attributable to gain from sales of U.S. real property interests are taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if that gain were effectively connected with the stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (effectively connected income). Non-U.S. stockholders thus would be taxed on such income at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. stockholders, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Distributions that are subject to FIRPTA also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a non-U.S. corporate stockholder. We are required to withhold 35% of any distribution that we designate (or, if greater, the amount that we could designate) as a capital gains dividend. The amount withheld is creditable against the non-U.S. stockholder’s FIRPTA tax liability.

A capital gain distribution from a REIT to a foreign investor will not be treated by a non-U.S. stockholder as effectively connected income, provided that (i) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the U.S. (our stock currently is so traded) and (ii) the foreign investor does not own more than 10% of the class of stock at any time during the taxable year within which the distribution is received. In that case, the foreign investor is not required to file a U.S. federal income tax return by reason of receiving such a distribution. Such a distribution is treated as an ordinary dividend that is subject to withholding and taxation as described above and is not treated as a capital gain. Also, the branch profits tax does not apply to such a distribution.

A gain recognized upon the sale of our stock by a non-U.S. stockholder could be treated as effectively connected income under FIRPTA if we are considered to be a United States Real Property Holding Corporation, or USRPHC. In general, a corporation is considered to be a USRPHC if more than 50% of its business assets at any time during a prescribed testing period (which is typically five years) consist of U.S. real property interests. Interests solely as a creditor, including most mortgage loans and MBS, are not considered to be U.S. real property interests. Although we hold certain U.S. real property interests, we do not believe that we are or have been a USRPHC, in which case FIRPTA would not apply to gain recognized upon a sale of our stock. 
Even if we become a USRPHC in the future, gains recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon a sale of our stock generally will not be taxed under FIRPTA if we are a domestically-controlled REIT, which is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of the stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders. Because our stock is publicly traded, we cannot assure our investors that we are or will remain a domestically-controlled REIT. Even if we are not a domestically-controlled REIT, however, a non-U.S. stockholder that owns, actually or constructively, 10% or less of our stock throughout a specified testing period will not recognize taxable gain on the sale of our stock under FIRPTA if the shares are traded on an established securities market.

If a gain from the sale of the stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the non-U.S. stockholder would be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to that gain, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. The 30% branch profits tax to which non-U.S. corporations are subject would not apply to such gain. In addition, the purchaser of the stock could be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the IRS.

32



The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, or the PATH Act, creates new exemptions from FIRPTA for foreign pension funds that meet certain requirements and for “qualified shareholders.” Qualified shareholders are certain foreign entities that are publicly traded “qualified collective investment vehicles” which are subject to exchange of information provisions pursuant to a tax treaty between the United States and their home country, maintain records identifying large shareholders and meet certain other requirements. To the extent that a non-U.S. stockholder is subject to either of these exemptions, FIRPTA will not apply either to gain recognized by the non-U.S. stockholder upon a sale of our stock or to capital gain dividend that is attributable to a sale by us of a U.S. real property interest. 
A gain upon the sale of our stock by a non-U.S. stockholder that is not subject to FIRPTA will be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder if:


◾ | the non-U.S. stockholder’s investment in the stock is effectively connected with a trade or business in the U.S., in which case the non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to that gain; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year and other conditions are met, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s capital gains.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

If the proceeds of a disposition of our stock are paid by or through a U.S. office of a broker-dealer, the payment is generally subject to information reporting and to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%) unless the disposing non-U.S. stockholder certifies as to his name, address and non-U.S. status or otherwise establishes an exemption. Generally, U.S. information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds if the payment is made outside the U.S. through a foreign office of a foreign broker-dealer. If the proceeds from a disposition of our stock are paid to or through a foreign office of a U.S. broker-dealer or a non-U.S. office of a foreign broker-dealer that is (i) a “controlled foreign corporation” for federal income tax purposes, (ii) a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for a three-year period was effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, (iii) a foreign partnership with one or more partners who are U.S. persons and who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interest in the partnership, or (iv) a foreign partnership engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., then (a) backup withholding will not apply unless the broker-dealer has actual knowledge that the owner is not a foreign stockholder, and (b) information reporting will not apply if the non-U.S. stockholder satisfies certification requirements regarding its status as a foreign stockholder.
Foreign Accounts

Shareholders that acquire our stock through an account maintained at a non-U.S. financial institution should be aware that the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which we refer to as “FATCA”) provides that a 30% withholding tax will be imposed on certain payments made to a foreign entity (such as dividends that we pay and proceeds from the sale of our stock) if such entity fails to satisfy certain new disclosure and reporting rules. FATCA generally requires that (i) in the case of shareholder that is foreign financial institution (defined broadly to include a hedge fund, a private equity fund, a mutual fund, a securitization vehicle or other investment vehicle), the entity identify and provide information with respect to financial accounts with such entity held (directly or indirectly) by U.S. persons and U.S.-owned foreign entities and (ii) in the case of a shareholder that is a non-financial foreign entity, the entity identify and provide information with respect to substantial U.S. owners of such entity.

The IRS has released guidance providing that FATCA withholding with respect to gross proceeds from the disposition of stock will not be imposed on payments made prior to January 1, 2020. The U.S. Treasury has signed certain Intergovernmental Agreements with other countries to implement the exchange of information required under FATCA. Shareholders that invest in the Company through an account maintained at a non-U.S. financial institution are strongly encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the potential application and impact of FATCA and any Intergovernmental Agreement between the United States and their home jurisdiction in connection with FATCA compliance.

33



State, Local and Foreign Taxation

We may be required to pay state, local and foreign taxes in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or make investments, and our stockholders may be required to pay state, local and foreign taxes in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions, including those in which they reside. Our state, local and foreign tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax consequences summarized above. In addition, a stockholder’s state, local and foreign tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax consequences summarized above. Consequently, prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of state, local and foreign tax laws on an investment in our stock.
Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations

Prospective investors and stockholders should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock.

The recently enacted PATH Act contains changes to certain aspects of the U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs. The Act modifies various rules that apply to a REIT’s ownership of and business relationship with its taxable REIT subsidiaries and reduces (beginning in 2018) the value of a REIT’s assets that may be in taxable REIT subsidiaries from 25% to 20%. The PATH Act makes permanent the reduction of the period (from ten years to five years) during which a REIT is subject to corporate-level tax on the recognition of built-in gains in assets of an acquired corporation.

The PATH Act also makes multiple changes related to FIRPTA, expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges, and repeals for publicly offered REITs the rules that previously could apply to limit the deductibility of certain distributions if they were considered to be preferential dividends. Lastly, the PATH Act adjusts the way a REIT calculates earnings and profits in certain circumstances to avoid double taxation at the shareholder level, and expands the types of assets and income treated as qualifying for purposes of the REIT requirements. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and the potential impact on an investment in our stock.
