History
 ERI was formed in September 2013 to be the parent company following the merger of wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company into Eldorado HoldCo LLC (“HoldCo”), a Nevada limited liability company formed in 2009 that is the parent company of Eldorado Resorts LLC (“Resorts”), and MTR Gaming Group, Inc. (“MTR Gaming”), a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1988 (the “MTR Merger”). Effective upon the consummation of the MTR Merger on September 19, 2014 (the “MTR Merger Date”), MTR Gaming and HoldCo each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ERI and, as a result of such transactions, Resorts became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ERI.
 Prior to November 24, 2015 (the “Reno Acquisition Date”), Resorts owned a 48.1% interest in the joint venture (the “Silver Legacy Joint Venture”) which owns Silver Legacy.  On November 24, 2015, Resorts consummated the acquisition of all of the assets and properties of Circus Circus Reno and the 50% membership interest in the Silver Legacy Joint Venture owned by Galleon, Inc. (collectively, the “Circus Reno/Silver Legacy Purchase” or the “Reno Acquisition”) pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 7, 2015 (the “Purchase Agreement”), entered into with Circus Circus Casinos, Inc. and Galleon, Inc., each an affiliate of MGM Resorts International, with respect to the acquisition. On the Reno Acquisition Date, Eldorado Resorts LLC also exercised its right to acquire the 3.8% interest in Eldorado Limited Liability Company (“ELLC”) held by certain affiliates and stockholders of the Company. As a result of these transactions, ELLC and CC-Reno, LLC, a newly formed Nevada limited liability company, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ERI, and Silver Legacy became an indirect wholly‑owned subsidiary of ERI.
 Business Strengths and Strategy 
 Personal service and high quality amenities
 We focus on customer satisfaction and delivering superior guest experiences.  We seek to provide our customers with an extraordinary level of personal service and popular gaming, dining and entertainment experiences designed to exceed customer expectations in a clean, safe, friendly and fun environment. Our senior management is actively involved in the daily operations of our properties, frequently interacting with gaming, hotel and restaurant patrons to ensure that they are receiving the highest level of personal attention. Management believes that personal service is an integral part of fostering customer loyalty and generating repeat business. We continually monitor our casino operations to react to changing market conditions and customer demands. We target both premium-play and value-conscious gaming patrons with differentiated offerings at our state-of-the-art casinos, which feature the latest in game technology, innovative bonus options, dynamic signage, customer-convenient features and non-gaming amenities at a reasonable value and price point.
 Diversified portfolio across markets and customer segments
 We are geographically diversified across the United States, with no single property accounting for more than 19% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our customer pool draws from a diversified base of both local and out-of-town patrons. For example, approximately 20% of our customer base at Eldorado Reno is local, while 80% visit from out-of-town and utilize our hotel, restaurants and other amenities for a full-service gaming experience. We have also initiated changes to our marketing strategy to reach more potential customers through targeted direct mailings and electronic marketing. We believe we have assembled a platform on which we can continue to grow and provide a differentiated customer experience.
 Management team with deep gaming industry experience and strong local relationships
 We have an experienced management team that includes, among others, Gary Carano, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, who has more than thirty years of experience in the gaming and hotel industry. Mr. Carano was the driving force behind ERI’s development and operations in Nevada and Louisiana and ERI’s acquisition of MTR Gaming and Circus Reno. In addition to Gary Carano, our senior executives have significant experience in the gaming and finance industries. Our extensive management experience and unwavering commitment to our team members, guests and equity holders have been the primary drivers of our strategic goals and success. We take pride in our reinvestment in our properties and the communities we support along with emphasizing our family-style approach in an effort to build loyalty among our team members and guests. We will continue to focus on the future growth and diversification of our company while maintaining our core values and striving for operational excellence.

Nevada
 The Eldorado Reno, Silver Legacy and Circus Reno properties, (the “Reno Tri-Properties”) are connected in a “seamless” manner by enclosed, climate controlled skywalks. These enclosed skywalks serve as entertainment bridge ways between the three properties and house slot machines, restaurants and retail shops. The Reno Tri-Properties comprise the heart of the Reno market’s prime gaming area and room base, providing the most extensive and the broadest variety of gaming, entertainment, lodging and dining amenities in the Reno area, with an aggregate of 4,096 rooms, 23 restaurants and enough parking to accommodate approximately 6,100 vehicles, and as of December 31, 2016, approximately 3,000 slot machines and 150 table and poker games. We believe that the centralized location and critical mass of these three properties, together with the ease of access between the facilities, provide significant advantages over other freestanding hotel/casinos in the Reno market.
 In September 2016, the Company announced that it plans to invest more than $50.0 million in facility enhancements to Eldorado Reno, Silver Legacy and Circus Reno. Eldorado’s master plan for the three connected properties, which span eight city blocks in downtown Reno, will be phased over three years, and commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 Reno is located at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains along Interstate 80, approximately 135 miles east of Sacramento, California and 225 miles east of San Francisco, California. Reno, along with nearby Lake Tahoe, is a destination market that attracts year‑round visitation by offering gaming, numerous summer and winter recreational activities and popular special events. Consequently, we believe that our success is influenced to some degree by the Lake Tahoe market. We believe that approximately two‑thirds of visitors to the Reno market arrive by some form of ground transportation. Popular special events include the United States Bowling Congress Men’s and Open Championship bowling tournaments, National Championship Air Races, a PGA tour event, Street Vibrations, a motorcycle event, and Hot August Nights, a vintage car event. Based on information reported by the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, gaming revenues for the Reno/Sparks gaming markets were $723.3 million, $694.0 million and $671.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Competition
 The gaming industry includes land‑based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on Native American reservations and other forms of legalized gaming. There is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Certain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future. Legalized casino gaming in these states and on Native American reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding Nevada, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, or Ohio could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with gaming facilities in other jurisdictions with dockside gaming facilities, state sponsored lotteries, on‑and‑off track pari‑mutuel wagering, card clubs, riverboat casinos and other forms of legalized gambling. In addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada and New Jersey and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition.
 Nevada.  Of the 30 casinos currently operating in the Reno market, we believe we compete principally with four other hotel‑casinos that each generate at least $36 million in annual gaming revenues. At this time, we cannot predict the extent to which new and proposed projects will be undertaken or the extent to which current hotel and/or casino space may be expanded. We expect that any additional rooms added in the Reno market will increase competition for visitor revenue. There can be no assurance that any growth in Reno’s current room base or gaming capacity will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 We also compete with hotel‑casinos located in the nearby Lake Tahoe region as well as those in other areas of Nevada. A substantial number of customers travel to both Reno and the Lake Tahoe area during their visits. Consequently, we believe that our success is influenced to some degree by the success of the Lake Tahoe market. While we do not anticipate a significant change in the popularity of either Reno or Lake Tahoe as tourist destination areas in the foreseeable future, any decline could adversely affect our operations.
 Since visitors from California comprise a significant portion of our customer base, we also compete with Native American gaming operations in California. The State of California has signed and ratified compacts with Native American tribes, including casinos located in northern California, which we consider to be a significant target market. These Native American tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on Native American lands.
 We believe the Reno market draws over 50% of its visitors from California. As northern California Native American gaming operations have expanded, we believe the increasing competition generated by these gaming operations has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, principally drive‑in, day‑trip visitor traffic from our main feeder markets in northern California.
 Louisiana.  The Shreveport/Bossier City, Louisiana gaming market is characterized by intense competition. We compete directly with five casinos, all but one of which have operated in the Shreveport/Bossier City market for several years and have established customer bases. In addition, we also compete with the slot machine facility at Louisiana Downs located in Bossier City and WinStar Casino and casino facilities owned by the Choctaw Nation located in Oklahoma. Casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the Shreveport/Bossier City market draws customers, primarily Texas. The Texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming. Any such proposal would require an amendment to the Texas State constitution, which requires approval by two‑thirds of the Texas State Legislature and approval by a majority of votes cast in a statewide voter referendum. Such approvals would legalize gaming in Texas notwithstanding vetoes by the Governor of casino gambling bills. There can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in Texas in the future, which may have a negative effect on our business. Eldorado Shreveport competes with several Native American casinos located in Oklahoma, certain of which are located near our core Texas markets. Because Eldorado Shreveport draws a significant amount of customers from the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas area, but is located approximately 190 miles from that area, we believe we will continue to face increased competition from gaming operations in Oklahoma and would face significant competition that may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations if casino gaming were to be approved in Texas.
 Eastern.  Mountaineer, Presque Isle Downs and Scioto Downs primarily compete with gaming facilities located in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, including, to a certain extent, each other, and gaming locations located in neighboring states including New York, Indiana and Michigan. In particular, Mountaineer (and to a lesser extent Presque Isle Downs) competes with other gaming facilities located in Pennsylvania.

Mountaineer competes with smaller gaming operations conducted in local bars and fraternal organizations. West Virginia law permits limited video lottery machines (“LVLs”) in local bars and fraternal organizations. The West Virginia Lottery Commission authorizes up to 7,500 slot machines in these facilities throughout West Virginia. No more than five slot machines are allowed in each establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, and no more than ten slot machines are allowed in each licensed fraternal organization. As of December 31, 2016, there were a total of approximately 1,000 LVL’s in bars and fraternal organizations in Hancock County, West Virginia (where Mountaineer is located) and the two neighboring counties (Brooke and Ohio counties). Although the bars and fraternal organizations housing these machines lack poker and table gaming, as well as the amenities and ambiance of our Mountaineer facility, they do compete with Mountaineer, particularly for the local patronage. While there are three other tracks and one resort in West Virginia that offer slot machine and table gaming, only one, Wheeling Island Casino, lies within Mountaineer’s market.
 Scioto Downs competes with one other property in the Columbus, Ohio, market, Hollywood Casino, which offers both VLTs and table games.
 Mountaineer’s, and to a lesser extent Presque Isle Downs’, racing and pari‑mutuel operations compete directly for wagering dollars with racing and pari‑mutuel operations at a variety of other horse and greyhound racetracks that conduct pari‑mutuel gaming. Mountaineer competes with racetracks across the country to have its signal carried by off‑track wagering parlors. Mountaineer, Presque Isle Downs and Scioto Downs also competes for wagering dollars with off‑track wagering facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and competes with other racetracks for participation by quality racehorses.
 General.  All of our gaming operations also compete to a lesser extent with operations in other locations, including Native American lands, and with other forms of legalized gaming in the United States, including state‑sponsored lotteries, on‑ and off‑track wagering, high‑stakes bingo, card parlors, and Internet gaming. In addition, casinos in Canada have likewise recently begun advertising and increasing promotional activities in our target markets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue” which is included elsewhere in this report.
 Governmental Gaming Regulations
 The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.
 Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
 Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable, to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
 A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Reporting and Record‑Keeping Requirements
 We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries which gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger which may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
 Taxation
 Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.
Internal Revenue Service Regulations
 The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners, for keno, bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno, bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, the other games.
 Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) and the Nevada Gaming Authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
 The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to conduct our business. We also own patents relating to unique casino games. We file copyright applications to protect our creative artworks, which are often featured in property branding, as well as our distinctive website content.

Seasonality
 Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and also may cause cancellations of live horse racing at the Eastern properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties, including the owners or operators of real property, to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, and could be subject to significant fines or penalties for any violations. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs related to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,400 employees. As of such date, we had 11 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 900 employees. No collective bargaining agreements covering sizable numbers of our employees are scheduled to expire in 2017.
