ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases. We use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative drugs for patients in specialty markets. Our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength. 
Cystic Fibrosis 
Our two marketed medicines are ORKAMBI and KALYDECO, which together are approved to treat approximately 40% of the 75,000 CF patients in North America, Europe and Australia. ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) is approved as a treatment for approximately 25,000 patients who have two copies (homozygous) of the F508del mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, gene. KALYDECO (ivacaftor) is approved for the treatment of approximately 4,000 CF patients who have the G551D mutation or other specified mutations in their CFTR gene. Our goal is to develop treatment regimens that will provide benefits to as many patients with CF as possible and will enhance the benefits that currently are being provided to patients taking our medicines.
CF Development Programs
We have multiple development programs in the field of CF, including:

• | Tezacaftor (VX-661) is a corrector compound that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. We expect data from this Phase 3 development program in the first half of 2017. If supported by data from the Phase 3 development program, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017. 


• | VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445 are next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that we are evaluating as part of combination treatment regimens. We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of VX-152 and VX-440 and expect data from these clinical trials in the second half of 2017. We have initiated Phase 1 clinical trials of VX-659 and VX-445. 


• | VX-371 is an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or ENaC, inhibitor that is being evaluated in a Phase 2 development program and which we exclusively licensed from Parion Sciences, Inc., or Parion, in 2015.

Research and Development Programs
We are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including programs in the areas of pain and neurology. We also have entered into third-party collaborations pursuant to which we are engaged in the discovery and development of nucleic acid-based therapies for a variety of diseases, including CF. We plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. Our current research programs include programs targeting cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, alpha-1 antritrypsin deficiency, sickle cell disease and polycystic kidney disease. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. 
CYSTIC FIBROSIS
Background
CF is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. CF is caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. To develop CF, children must inherit two defective CFTR genes, which are referred to as alleles - one from each parent. There are more than 1,900 known mutations in the CFTR gene, some of which result in CF. The vast majority of patients with CF carry at least one of the two of the most prevalent mutations, the F508del mutation and the G551D mutation. 
1

The F508del mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of cells in sufficient quantities. The G551D mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the defective CFTR protein reaches the surface of a cell but does not efficiently transport chloride ions across the cell membrane. The absence of working CFTR proteins results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in a number of organs, including the lungs. As a result, thick, sticky mucus builds up and blocks the passages in many organs, leading to a variety of symptoms. In particular, mucus builds up and clogs the airways in the lungs, causing chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, increases the open probability of the CFTR protein channels on the cell surface increasing the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell. CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor, tezacaftor, VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445 help CFTR proteins reach the cell surface. We believe that ENaC inhibitors, such as VX-371, may help maintain mucus hydration and accelerate pulmonary mucus clearance.
We use the brand name for our products when we refer to the product that has been approved and with respect to the indications on the approved label. Otherwise, including in discussions of our CF development programs, we refer to our compounds by their scientific (or generic) name.
ORKAMBI (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) 
ORKAMBI is an orally-administered combination therapy comprised of lumacaftor, a CFTR corrector, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, that is approved in the United States, European Union, Australia and Canada for the treatment of patients with CF twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. In the United States, ORKAMBI is also approved for the treatment of patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced the results of a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to support European approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. The clinical trial met its primary endpoint of absolute change in lung clearance index, or LCI2.5, through 24 weeks of treatment, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in LCI2.5 among patients treated with ORKAMBI compared to placebo. Based on these results, we plan to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, line extension to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, seeking approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this patient population in the European Union in the first half of 2017.
We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF two to five years of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. We expect enrollment in the first part of this clinical trial to be complete in mid-2017. The first part of the two-part clinical trial is evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics to inform dose selection for the second part of the clinical trial. The primary endpoint of the second part of the clinical trial is safety and tolerability, with multiple efficacy measurements as secondary endpoints.
KALYDECO (ivacaftor)
KALYDECO (ivacaftor) is an orally-administered CFTR potentiator that is approved in the United States, European Union, Australia and Canada for the treatment of certain patients with CF who have specific mutations in their CFTR gene. In the United States, KALYDECO is approved for the treatment of patients with CF two years of age and older who have one of the following mutations in their CFTR gene: G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D and R117H. In the European Union, KALYDECO is approved for the treatment of patients with CF (i) two years of age and older who have one of the following mutations in their CFTR gene: G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P and G1349D and (ii) eighteen years of age and older who have the R117H mutation in their CFTR gene.
We have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for ivacaftor in patients with CF less than two years of age to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on markers of CF disease in young children. The clinical trial utilizes a weight-based dose of ivacaftor granules that can be mixed in soft foods or liquids. The clinical trial is enrolling patients with one of the ten CFTR gene mutations for which KALYDECO is currently approved.
Tezacaftor (VX-661) in Combination with Ivacaftor
Tezacaftor is an orally-administered CFTR corrector drug candidate that we are evaluating in a Phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple CF patient populations who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. We expect data from this Phase 3 development program in the first half of 2017. If supported 
2

by data from the Phase 3 development program, we plan to submit a NDA to the FDA for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the second half of 2017.
 The ongoing clinical trials in this Phase 3 development program are:

• | Two copies of the F508del in their CFTR gene: We have completed enrollment in this clinical trial and expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2017; 


• | One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in residual CFTR function: We have completed enrollment in this clinical trial and expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of 2017; and


• | One copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that results in a gating defect in the CFTR protein: We plan to complete enrollment in this clinical trial in the first half of 2017. Data from this clinical trial are not expected to be included in the initial regulatory applications for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. 

In the third quarter of 2016, we completed an interim futility analysis of efficacy data from the first part of a fourth clinical trial in patients with one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. The analysis showed that the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor did not result in a pre-specified improvement in lung function in this patient group. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, recommended that we stop the clinical trial and not initiate enrollment in the second part of this clinical trial. There were no safety concerns noted in the DSMB's review of the data. We subsequently reviewed the data and concurred with the DSMB’s assessment. We have closed this clinical trial based on the recommendation of the DSMB. The planned NDA for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor will include safety data from this clinical trial.
In addition to evaluating the efficacy of the combination regimen, these Phase 3 clinical trials will provide safety data on the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor to support the planned development of a triple combination regimen that includes a next-generation corrector in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.
In addition to the Phase 3 development program described above, we also are conducting a Phase 3 open-label clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with CF six to eleven years of age who have either (i) two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene or (ii) one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation in their CFTR gene that has clinically demonstrated to be responsive to ivacaftor, including gating and residual function mutations.
Next-generation CFTR Corrector Compounds
We are developing next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that we plan to evaluate as part of triple combination treatment regimens. We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of:

• | VX-440 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of four-week dosing of VX-440 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in approximately 40 patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function and approximately 25 patients with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene; and


• | VX-152 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two-week dosing of VX-152 in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in approximately 35 patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function and approximately 25 patients with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene.

Data from these clinical trials are expected in the second half of 2017 and if successful, are intended to support the potential initiation of Phase 3 development of VX-440 and a longer-duration Phase 2b or registrational program for VX-152. 
We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-659, an additional next-generation corrector, to evaluate single ascending doses, multiple ascending doses and triple combination dosing in healthy volunteers and will include an arm to evaluate triple combination dosing in patients with CF who have one copy of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene and a second mutation that results in minimal CFTR function. This clinical trial is enrolling healthy volunteers, and we expect to begin 
3

enrolling CF patients in this clinical trial in the first half of 2017. Dosing of a fourth next generation corrector, VX-445, began in the first quarter of 2017. Pending data from these Phase 1 clinical trials, we plan to begin Phase 2 development for one or both of these additional next-generation correctors in the second half of 2017.
ENaC Inhibition
In 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Parion to develop investigational ENaC inhibitors, including VX-371, for the potential treatment of CF and other pulmonary diseases. Preclinical evaluation in human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells from patients with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene showed that the addition of VX-371 to lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor resulted in an additional increase in both airway surface liquid and cilia beat frequency compared to baseline and to the use of VX-371 or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor alone. Improvements in airway surface liquid height and cilia beat frequency are believed to be measures of increased hydration of the cell surface.
In the second quarter of 2016, Parion completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in 142 patients with CF with no restriction on the mutations in their CFTR gene. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was safety as compared to patients on placebo. Secondary endpoints evaluated the effect on mean absolute forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1 and patient-reported respiratory symptoms as reported in the CF questionnaire-revised, or CFQ-R. The clinical trial met its primary safety endpoint and data from the clinical trial showed that VX-371 was generally well-tolerated. There were no statistically significant changes in FEV1 or CFQ-R for patients who received VX-371.
In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating VX-371 in combination with ORKAMBI, both with and without the addition of hypertonic saline, in patients with CF twelve years of age and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. The primary endpoints of this clinical trial are safety and mean absolute change from baseline in FEV1 at day 28 as compared to patients on placebo. We expect data from this clinical trial to be available in the second half of 2017.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
Our approach to project selection and drug design aims to enhance our ability to discover and develop drug candidates by combining transformative insights into the causes of serious diseases with innovative approaches to therapeutics. Historically, our approach to drug discovery has focused on the research and development of small molecule drugs, which has been validated through our success in moving novel small molecule drug candidates into clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals for ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and INCIVEK (telapravir). Recently, we have expanded our research capabilities to include additional innovative therapeutic approaches with a focus on nucleic acid-based therapies. We believe that attempting to identify multiple approaches to the treatment of diseases enhances our potential to develop treatment options that, either as monotherapies or combination therapies, are transformational in nature. 
We focus our research activities on developing products that would be prescribed by specialist physicians for the treatment of rare or life-threatening diseases. We begin by applying our knowledge of human genetics and human biology and focus on validated targets that have shown a causal relationship with respect to serious diseases. We generate biological assays to query the underlying biology of disease and utilize clinical biomarkers as tools to predict clinical response. We leverage our expertise in assay automation, medicinal and process chemistry, modeling and informatics, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, toxicology, material sciences and formulation to develop, select and advance drug candidates that have the potential to offer transformative benefits and have an efficient path to approval. Our current research programs include programs targeting cystic fibrosis, pain, adrenoleukodystrophy, alpha-1 antritrypsin deficiency, sickle cell disease and polycystic kidney disease. 
To augment our internal research programs, we seek to collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations as needed to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest as well as to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy. We have established such relationships with organizations around the world and intend to extend and leverage that experience to further our research efforts to discover transformational medicines for serious diseases.
In addition to our continuing research efforts in CF, our research and mid- and early-stage development programs currently include VX-371 for the treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia, VX-150 for the treatment of pain and VX-210 for the treatment of acute cervical spinal cord injury. We are also collaborating with CRISPR Therapeutics AG, or CRISPR, on 
4

the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology and Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., or Moderna, to identify and develop messenger ribonucleic acid, or mRNA, therapeutics for the treatment of CF.
COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION
Our commercial organization focuses on supporting sales of ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in the markets where such products are approved. Our sales and marketing organizations are responsible for promoting products to health care providers and obtaining reimbursement for products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the United States and non-U.S. markets. 
Our U.S. field-based CF commercial team is comprised of a small number of individuals whom we believe will be sufficient to support future needs. We focus our CF marketing efforts in the United States on a relatively small number of physicians and health care professionals who write most of the prescriptions for CF medicines. Many of these physicians and health care professionals are located at a limited number of accredited centers in the United States focused on the treatment of CF. In international markets, we have a small sales force that promotes KALYDECO and ORKAMBI in jurisdictions where these products are approved. 
We market our products through personal interactions with individual physicians, advertising, sending direct mail, public relations activities and other activities. In addition, our government affairs and public policy group advocates for policies that promote life sciences innovation and increase awareness of the diseases on which we are focusing, with state and federal legislatures, government agencies, public health officials and other policy-makers. We also have established programs in the United States that provide our products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria.
COLLABORATIONS
We have entered into collaborations with pharmaceutical and other companies and organizations that provide us financial and other resources, including capabilities in research, development, manufacturing and sales and marketing, and licenses to intellectual property. These collaborations have provided us with drug candidates and/or important financial and non-financial resources that have contributed to our products and a number of the drug candidates in our current development pipeline. We may seek to license or acquire drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or to provide us with new commercial opportunities. In particular, we are focusing on drug candidates for the treatment of patients with CF and other third-party drug candidates that could be developed for specialty markets. Furthermore, we may seek collaborators to support, develop and/or commercialize some of our current drug candidates and/or additional drug candidates that may emerge from our research activities. 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Incorporated
We began working with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Incorporated, or CFFT, in 1998. We entered into a collaboration agreement with CFFT in 2004 and have amended it several times to support research and development activities. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, as amended, we have agreed to pay tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on any approved drugs first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, lumacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits on potential sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016. For combination products, such as ORKAMBI, sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product. Pursuant to an amendment entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016, the CFFT paid us an upfront program award of $75.0 million and agreed to provide development funding to us of up to $6.0 million annually.
For ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor, we will have royalty obligations to CFFT until the expiration of patents covering that compound. We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that expire in 2027 and 2025, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions. We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of lumacaftor that expire in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions. We have patents in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of tezacaftor that expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential patent life extensions.

Janssen Inc. is responsible for costs related to the development and commercialization of the compounds. Janssen Inc. may terminate the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, upon six months’ notice. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights, as appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. We have patents and pending patent applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, methods of making or using those compounds and proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform.
Much of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us.
While we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in our patent portfolio, we believe that the patents and patent applications in the United States and the European Union that are the most important to our business are those that claim the composition-of-matter of our drugs and drug candidates that have progressed at least into Phase 3 clinical trials. The following table sets forth the status of such primary patents and patent applications in the United States and the European Union covering the composition-of-matter of these drugs and drug candidates:

Drug/Drug Candidate | Status of United States Patent (Anticipated Expiration, Subject to Potential Extensions) | Status of European Union Patent (Anticipated Expiration, Subject to Potential Extensions)
Ivacaftor | Granted (2027) | Granted (2025) 
Lumacaftor | Granted (2030) | Granted (2026) 
Tezacaftor | Granted (2027) | Granted (2028) 

We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in foreign countries we deem appropriate, claiming intellectual property developed as part of our research and development programs. In addition to the composition-of-matter patents and patent applications listed above, we hold or have exclusive licenses to the following intellectual property:

• | U.S. and foreign patent applications covering CF potentiators, correctors and ENaC inhibitors, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, VX-371, VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445 and many other related compounds, and the use of those potentiators, correctors and ENaC inhibitors to treat CF.


• | U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering VX-150 and VX-241 and the use of VX-150 and VX-241 to treat pain indications.


• | U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering VX-210 and the use of VX-210 to treat neurology indications.

8


• | U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering the manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions, related solid forms, formulations, dosing regimens and methods of use of these compounds, including ivacaftor and lumacaftor.

We cannot be certain, however, that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents.
From time to time we enter into non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities. These license agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee, but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the related research.
Ivacaftor was granted orphan drug status in the United States and the European Union. We have a U.S. patent that covers the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in the United States through its expiration date in 2027. We have a European patent that covers the composition-of-matter of ivacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in the European Union through its expiration date in 2025, subject to potential extension. We are entitled to orphan drug exclusivity for ivacaftor in the United States and the European Union, which means that the FDA may not approve another application to market ivacaftor for the same indication for a period of seven years following approval, and the EMA cannot accept an MAA for a drug similar to ivacaftor for a period of ten years following approval.  As a result of the orphan drug exclusivity, even if a competitor successfully challenges the ivacaftor patents, it could not obtain approval from the FDA to market ivacaftor in the United States for the treatment of patients who have one of the mutations to the CFTR gene for which KALYDECO is currently approved until 2019, or submit an MAA in the European Union for the treatment of patients who have one of the mutations to the CFTR gene for which KALYDECO is currently approved until 2022, except in very limited circumstances.
Lumacaftor was granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union and the fixed dose combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor was granted orphan drug status in the United States. We have patents in the United States and European Union that cover the composition of matter of lumacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in these jurisdictions through their expiration dates in 2030 and 2026, respectively, subject to potential extension.
Tezacaftor was granted orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union. We have patents in the United States and European Union that cover the composition of matter of tezacaftor that we expect will provide intellectual property protection in these jurisdictions through their expiration dates in 2027 and 2028, respectively, subject to potential extension.
MANUFACTURING
Manufacturing Approach and Philosophy
As we market and sell our approved products and advance our drug candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on internal capabilities and an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials. Wherever possible, we seek to establish multiple suppliers for each raw material and step in the manufacturing process, however our supply chain includes a single-source manufacturer for (i) one step in the ivacaftor manufacturing process and (ii) the manufacture of the oral granule formulation of KALYDECO that is used for patients with CF two to five years of age.
We expect that we will continue for the foreseeable future to rely on third parties to meet most of our commercial supply needs and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs. We have established our own small-scale manufacturing capabilities, which we use for clinical trial supplies and as an additional source for commercial supplies. 
Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, supply us with raw materials, and convert these raw materials into drug substance, and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. Establishing and managing this global supply chain for each of our drugs and drug candidates requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.
9

We have developed systems and processes to track, monitor and oversee our third-party manufacturers’ activities, including a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. We regularly evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers with the objective of confirming their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically. Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities. 
Manufacture of KALYDECO (ivacaftor)
We obtain ivacaftor to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network. A disruption in the commercial supply of KALYDECO would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues. A disruption in the clinical supply of ivacaftor could delay the completion of clinical trials and/or affect timelines for submitting regulatory filings. 
Manufacture of ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor)
We have developed several manufacturing processes to produce commercial quantities of ORKAMBI, including a process utilizing continuous manufacturing technology as well as a batch manufacturing process. We have established manufacturing capabilities at our third-party manufacturer in the United Kingdom that is producing commercial quantities of ORKAMBI using a batch manufacturing process we designed. We have established continuous manufacturing capabilities and completed validation for these capabilities at our facility located in Boston, Massachusetts. While continuous process manufacturing has been used in many industries, we believe that we are the first company to obtain FDA approval for a fully-continuous drug product manufacturing process. 
Manufacture of Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor
We are using both a batch manufacturing process and a continuous drug product manufacturing process to obtain a supply of tezacaftor tablets being used in our Phase 3 clinical trials of tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. If we successfully complete development and obtain approval for tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, we plan to produce our commercial supply of tezacaftor using a continuous drug product manufacturing process.
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress and intense competition. There are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our drugs are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. We face competition based on the safety and efficacy of our products and drug candidates, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent protection and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more effective patent protection. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our drug candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. Future competitive products may render our products, or future products, obsolete or noncompetitive. 
Cystic Fibrosis
An increasing number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of CF, including companies such as Concert Pharmaceuticals, Galapagos NV in collaboration with Abbvie, Genzyme, which is a division of Sanofi, Novartis, Pfizer, ProQR Therapeutics, Proteostasis Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics and several private companies. Although we are the first company to successfully develop drugs that treat the underlying cause of CF, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO are collectively approved to treat only a portion of patients with CF. Our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying and developing CFTR potentiators, CFTR correctors, ENaC inhibitors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action or that utilize new therapeutic approaches that seek to address 
10

the underlying cause of CF. Our competitors are exploring the development of drug candidates both as monotherapies and as part of combination regimens. Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing KALYDECO and ORKAMBI may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for CF. If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with CF, our revenues from ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and/or our other CF drug candidates, if then approved, could face significant competitive pressure.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, safety monitoring, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution import, export and marketing of our products and drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities.
United States Government Regulation
New Drug Application Approval Processes
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, including small molecules, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve or delay in review of pending applications;


• | withdrawal of an approval or the implementation of limitations on a previously approved indication for use;


• | imposition of a clinical hold, a risk mitigation and evaluation strategy or other safety-related limitations;


• | warning letters or “untitled letters”;


• | product seizures;


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or


• | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, refusals of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Once a drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal pharmacology and toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is 
11

submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND also will include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. If an IND is placed on clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific clinical trials or all clinical trials conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, and monitor the clinical trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some drug candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 


• | Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 

Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients.
We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States, as outlined below:

Phase | Estimated Duration 
Discovery | 2 to 4 years 
Preclinical | 1 to 2 years 
Phase 1 | 1 to 2 years 
Phase 2 | 2 to 4 years 
Phase 3 | 2 to 4 years 
FDA approval | 8 months to 2 years

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the drug candidate.
12

As part of the development process, companies usually complete animal safety studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug candidate. The FDA reviews each NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. The FDA has approximately two months to make a decision on whether to accept an NDA for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA may not approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug candidate is manufactured and tested. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
Biologics License Application Process
Certain of our drug candidates may be regulated by the FDA under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act as biologics. Biologics can present special safety, efficacy and manufacturing challenges that may differ from those present in the regulation of small molecule drugs. As such, while similar to the NDA review process described above, in lieu of filing an NDA, biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval of such BLA by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S. 
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drug candidates that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drug candidates to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drug candidates that offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months after acceptance for filing, as compared to a standard review time of ten months after acceptance for filing. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug candidate and expedite review of the application for a drug candidate designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs that treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or 
13

physical sign that the FDA determines is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials.
In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was enacted, amending the FDCA. As part of FDASIA, Congress created a drug designation called “Breakthrough Therapy.” This designation is intended to facilitate expedited development and review of a compound which, alone or in combination with one or more other compounds, is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the compound may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough Therapy designation may be requested at the filing of, or as an amendment to, an IND based on criteria established by the FDA. 
Actions identified in FDASIA that may expedite the development and review of a Breakthrough Therapy include, as appropriate: holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. 
Post-approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, under the FDCA the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the product;


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;


• | drug sampling and distribution requirements;


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;


• | complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt manufacture or distribution of our products, or require substantial resources to correct.
From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed.
14

Patent Term Restoration and Data Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the later of the effective date of an IND or the issuance date of the patent, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the data exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. 
Pediatric Exclusivity
Section 505A of the FDCA, as amended by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, provides for pediatric exclusivity which, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including non-patent and orphan exclusivity. If the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, in the form of a written request, relating to the use of the drug in children and such information is accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. The FDA may not issue a written request for clinical trials on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
Exclusivity of Biologics
Biologics are entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to as the ACA.  The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic plus any extension term for pediatrics as discussed above. Historically, a biologic approved under a BLA was not subject to the generic drug review and approval provisions of the FDCA. However, the ACA created a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-approved biological product. In order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the United States. The law establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products, which protects the data in the original BLA by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reference to data in the original BLA. 
15

Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or more than 200,000 people in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and tezacaftor have been granted designation as orphan drugs by the FDA.
If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs, such as KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, to ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors increasingly are reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of 
16

generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our revenues. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our products. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The ACA was enacted in March 2010 and is designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. The branded prescription drug fee is not tax deductible. We cannot predict all of the effects of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. 
In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of ORKAMBI, KALYDECO and of any other drug candidates we may develop, depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States. 
In some countries, such as Germany and France, commercial sales of a new product can occasionally begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the member states of the European Union can restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will provide for reimbursement of our products, or such countries may only provide 
17

for reimbursement on terms that we do not deem adequate. Additionally, reimbursement discussions in ex-U.S. markets may take a significant period of time.
Other United States Regulations
Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals.
Anti-kickback Laws
U.S. federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.
The penalties for violating the anti-kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including third-party payors.
State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. Provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each false claim. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal health care programs. Given the number of claims likely to be at issue, potential damages under the False Claims Act for even a single inappropriate arrangement could be significant. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payors.
Federal Prohibitions on Health Care Fraud and False Statements Related to Health Care Matters
Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws there are numerous regulations for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. Additional administrative simplification provisions created the following federal crimes: health care fraud, false statements relating to health care matters, theft or embezzlement in connection with a health benefit program and obstruction of criminal investigation of health care offenses. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including a private insurer. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. The theft or embezzlement statute prohibits knowingly and willfully embezzling, stealing or otherwise converting or misapplying the money or property of a health care benefit program. The obstruction of criminal investigations of health care offenses statute prohibits willfully preventing, obstructing, misleading or delaying the communication of information and records relating to a violation of a federal health care offense to a criminal investigator. A violation of any of these laws is a felony and may result in fines, or exclusion from the federal health care programs.

US Open Payments (formerly Physician Payment Sunshine Act)
Open Payments (commonly known as the Sunshine Act) is a federal program, required by the ACA, that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. In February 2013, regulations were released that contain detailed guidance regarding the information that must be collected and reported. We were required to collect information regarding such payments starting in August 2013 and were required to begin reporting such information in March 2014. Over the next several years, we will need to continue to dedicate significant resources to enhance our systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France which has adopted the Loi Bertrand, or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013. 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Other Regulations
In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we also are subject to regulation in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, now or hereafter in effect.
