ITEM 1.

 BUSINESS.
​
 When we use the terms “we,” “us,” the “Company,” “Diamond S” or “our” in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Diamond S Shipping Inc. and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “U.S. dollars,” “USD,” “dollars,” “US$” and “$” in this annual report are to the lawful currency of the United States of America. We use the term deadweight ton (“dwt”) in describing the size of our vessels. Dwt, expressed in metric tons, each of which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms, refers to the maximum weight of cargo and supplies that a vessel can carry.Company Overview
We provide seaborne transportation of crude oil, refined petroleum and other products in the international shipping markets. As of March 20, 2020, our operating fleet consisted of 66 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately five million dwt. Our vessel operations are composed of two segments: crude tankers, which consists of 15 Suezmax vessels and one Aframax vessel, and product tankers, which consists of 50 medium range (“MR”) vessels. 
 We are one of the largest publicly listed owners and operators of crude and product tankers in the world. The average age of our overall fleet is approximately 9.5 years weighted by dwt and ownership for the calendar year 2020. Our MR fleet has an average age of approximately 11.5 years, which is approximately equal to the global MR fleet average age. Our Suezmax fleet has an average age of approximately 7.6 years, which compares favorably to the industry average Suezmax age of approximately 10.1 years. 
 Our full fleet of 66 vessels is active in the market and earning revenue. Our customers primarily include large, well-established charterers, which include fully integrated oil companies (oil majors), smaller oil companies (refiners), oil traders, large oil distributors, governments and national oil companies, and storage facility operators. 
 We pursue a chartering strategy that seeks an optimal mix of employment of our vessels. We currently operate our vessels in both spot and time charter markets, with approximately 20% of our fleet on time charters with average remaining charter term of 0.9 years as of March 20, 2020. We believe that, in current market conditions, employing our fleet on a mix of spot and short-term time charters (which we define as time charters with an initial term of one year or less) positions us favorably to generate attractive returns and to benefit from rising charter rates. 
 Business Strategy
The international tanker industry is highly competitive and deeply cyclical. The goal of our strategy is to navigate this volatile environment and manage our fleet in a manner that produces strong cash flows and allows us to build upon our position as a leading provider of international seaborne transportation of crude oil and petroleum products. The key pillars of our strategy are: 
 Optimize Fleet Mix
As a leading owner and operator of tanker vessels with significant scale in the two largest liquid bulk markets, crude oil and petroleum products, we seek to maintain a continued presence in both markets, which we believe has a number of benefits. Our presence in the product tanker sector provides us with a lower-beta cash flow stream which leverages our low-cost structure, enabling us to maintain optionality as the global seaborne trade mix evolves over time, our participation in the crude tanker sector, where charter rates have historically experienced volatility, provides us with the opportunity to realize potential uncapped rate upside, and the dual market tanker platform allows us to opportunistically take advantage of attractive tanker supply dynamics as they arise in either market. 
 Spot Focused Vessel Employment
We believe spot and short-term time charter operations generate superior returns over time relative to a long duration time charter strategy. We intend to position the majority of our vessels to continue to compete

 in the spot market. However, we intend to actively manage the fleet given the prevailing market environment. When freight rates are nearing historical peaks, we will likely take on additional time charter cover. 
 Maintain Conservative Financial Structure and Disciplined Capital Allocation
Given the unpredictability and cyclicality of tanker rates, maintaining conservative financial leverage positions us favorably to successfully navigate unanticipated downturns and remain flexible to pursue accretive opportunities at all points in the cycle. Our moderate and low-cost indebtedness leads to reasonable debt service payments and enables us to maintain industry leading cash break even rates on our vessels. 
 Opportunistic Asset Management
We actively manage the size of our fleet and continually evaluate suitable vessel acquisitions and divestitures based on prevailing and expected freight rates and the private market valuations of tanker vessels. In pursuit of this strategy, we may acquire or sell vessels at attractive points in the cycle. 
 History and Development of the Company
Diamond S Shipping Inc. was formed on November 14, 2018 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the purpose of receiving, via contribution from Capital Product Partners L.P. (“CPLP”), CPLP’s crude and product tanker business including 25 vessels (the “Athena Vessels”) and combining that business with the business and operations of DSS Holdings L.P. (“DSS LP”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, dated as of November 27, 2018 (as amended, the “Transaction Agreement”), by and among CPLP, DSS LP, DSSI and the other parties named therein. DSS LP was a Cayman Islands limited partnership formed on October 1, 2007. Such contribution and combination, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, are referred to herein as the “Transactions.” The Transactions closed on March 27, 2019 and the Diamond S common shares commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on March 28, 2019 under the symbol “DSSI.” 
 Below is a simplified step-by-step description of the sequence of material events relating to the Transactions: 
  Step 1: Formation.   On November 14, 2018, CPLP formed Diamond S as a wholly owned subsidiary. We issued 500 common shares to CPLP at formation. We formed four wholly owned subsidiaries organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, referred to as “Products Merger Entity,” “Crude Merger Entity,” “Management Merger Entity” and “Surviving Merger Entity.” 
  Step 2: Separation.   CPLP separated its product and crude tanker businesses into separate lines of subsidiaries and contributed them to us. We issued 12,724,500 additional common shares in connection with the contribution by CPLP. In the separation, CPLP contributed to us (1) the Athena Vessels, (2) an amount in cash equal to $10 million and (3) associated inventories. 
  Step 3: Distribution.   On March 27, 2019, CPLP distributed on a pro rata basis all 12,725,000 then-outstanding common shares of Diamond S to its unitholders of record as of March 19, 2019. 
  Step 4: Combination.   Immediately following the distribution, (1) DSS Crude Transport Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS LP, merged with Crude Merger Entity, with DSS Crude Transport Inc. surviving the merger, (2) DSS Products Transport Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS LP, merged with Products Merger Entity, with DSS Products Transport Inc. surviving the merger, and (3) Diamond S Technical Management LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DSS LP, merged with Management Merger Entity, with Diamond S Technical Management LLC surviving the merger. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, DSS LP received 27,165,696 common shares of Diamond S in the combination and in turn distributed those common shares to its limited partners. Following these mergers and pursuant to the same plan each of DSS Crude Transport Inc., DSS Products Transport Inc. and Diamond S Technical Management LLC merged with the Surviving Merger Entity, with the Surviving Merger Entity surviving. Surviving Merger Entity subsequently merged with Diamond S, with Diamond S surviving.

 Recent Developments and Other Developments
2019 Refinancing
On December 27, 2019, we refinanced certain of our existing indebtedness with the proceeds of a new Credit Agreement, dated December 23, 2019 (the “$525 Million Facility”), by and among Nordea Bank Abp, New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and five additional lenders and the Company, consisting of a $375 million term loan and a revolving loan of $150 million. The $525 Million Facility matures on December 27, 2024 and borrowings under the $525 Million Facility bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate for a three-month interest period, plus a margin of 2.5%. The repayment profile reflects a 17-year, age-adjusted amortization and the first amortization period begins on March 31, 2020 and is secured by, among other things, mortgages over 10 Suezmax vessels and 26 MR vessels in our fleet. 
 The $525 Million Facility includes covenants relating to, among other things, our ability to incur further indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends, maintaining a minimum cash balance, collateral maintenance, maintaining a net debt to capitalization ratio and other customary restrictions and provides for customary events of default. 
 In connection with the refinancing, effective as of December 27, 2019, we terminated and repaid amounts outstanding under (i) our $460 million senior secured term loan facility due June 2021 (the “$460 Million Facility”), (ii) our $235 million senior secured financing facility due August 2021, consisting of a term loan of $220 million and a revolving loan of $15 million (the “$235 Million Facility”), and (iii) our $75 million senior secured term loan facility due March 2023 (the “$75 Million Facility”). We incurred no termination penalties in connection with the early termination of these facilities but recognized a non-cash charge of approximately $4.0 million representing the write-off of deferred financing costs. 
 Share Repurchase Program
On March 4, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, providing authorization to repurchase up to $50 million of our common shares, effective for a period of one year. We may repurchase these shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, at times and prices that we consider to be appropriate. As of the date hereof, we repurchased 137,289 shares for a total of $1.4 million under the share repurchase program.

 Chartering Strategy
We pursue a chartering strategy that seeks an optimal mix of employment of our vessels, primarily depending on fluctuations in freight rates. We currently operate our vessels in both spot and time charter markets. Our chartering objective is to remain opportunistic to benefit from the underlying volatility of the tanker freight markets while maintaining a presence in the shorter-term time charter market. We generally view short duration time charters (which we define as time charters with an initial term of one year or less) as an extension of our spot market presence. 
 Spot Market
Spot market charters, including voyage charters, are generally contracts to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed freight per ton of cargo or a specified total amount. Under spot market voyage charters, the Company pays voyage expenses such as port, canal and bunker costs. Spot charter rates are volatile and fluctuate on a seasonal and year-to-year basis. Fluctuations derive from

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 imbalances in the availability of cargoes for shipment and the number of vessels available at any given time to transport these cargoes. Vessels operating in the spot market generate revenue that is less predictable, but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates. We also consider short-term time charters as an extension of our spot market activities. 
 Time Charters
A time charter is an agreement covering the chartering out of a vessel to an end-user for a defined period of time. Under time charters, the owner is responsible for crewing the vessel, but the charterer is responsible for port costs and bunkers (fuel). Time charters, including bareboat charters, give the Company a fixed and stable cash flow for a known period of time. Time charters also mitigate in part the seasonality of the spot market business, which is generally weaker in the summer and autumn seasons. 
 Our Vessel Managers
Diamond Anglo Ship Management Pte. Ltd. (“DASM”), our joint venture over which we have management control, and three third-party ship managers, Anglo-Eastern Shipmanagement (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (“AESM”), Executive Ship Management (Singapore) (“ESM”) and Fleet Management Limited (Hong Kong) (“FML”), provide the Company with technical services with respect to the vessels historically owned by DSS LP. As of December 31, 2019, DASM provided these services to 33 of our vessels, and AESM, ESM and FML each provided services to eight of our vessels. Technical management services primarily include vessel operation, maintenance and crewing services for the vessels in our fleet. and the related office, accounting, legal and insurance services. DASM operates under a safety management system in compliance with the IMO’s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”) and certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Re. DASM’s management systems also comply with the Quality Standard ISO 9001, the Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001, and the Occupational Health & Safety Management System 18001. 
 Capital Ship Management Corp. (“CSM”), a related party of ours, provides various services to 25 of our vessels that were originally contributed by CPLP. Pursuant to the management and services agreement (the “Management and Services Agreement”, and together with the related technical and commercial management services agreements that we entered into with CSM, the “Management Agreements”) we receive technical management services, commercial management services of the vessels, vessel maintenance and crewing, purchasing, insurance and drydock supervision. CSM operates under a safety management system in compliance with the IMO’s ISM Code and certified by Lloyd’s Register. CSM’s management systems also comply with the Quality Standard ISO 9001, the Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001, the Occupational Health & Safety Management System 18001 and the Energy Management Standard 50001, all of which are certified by Lloyd’s. CSM has furthermore implemented an “Integrated Management System Approach” verified by Lloyd’s. CSM also adopted “Business Continuity Management” principles in cooperation with Lloyd’s. 
 Under the Management and Services Agreement, we compensate CSM with (1) a daily technical management fee of $850 per vessel for technical management services, subject to an annual increase based on the total percentage increase in the consumer price index in the immediately preceding 12 months, (2) a reimbursement for all reasonable and documented direct and indirect costs, liabilities, legal expenses and other expenses incurred by CSM in providing any technical management services not covered in (1) above, (3) a commercial management fee of 1.25% of all gross charter revenues generated by each vessel, and (4) an annual commercial management consultancy fee of $2.0 million. 
 The Management Agreements have a term of five years from the closing of the Transactions unless terminated upon 120 days’ notice by either the Company or CSM for cause, or a change of control occurs at either the Company or CSM, among other things. Upon an early termination of the Management Agreement other than in certain circumstances such as cause, the fee will be adjusted as at the effective date of the termination and become immediately payable. 
 Pursuant to the Management and Services Agreement, CSM has a right of first refusal, exercisable up to four times, to provide technical management services for up to a total of 29 vessels. If we sell or otherwise dispose of vessels such that CSM provides technical management services to fewer than 25 vessels, we are

 required to work in good faith to replace such vessels within six months; however, in any case, we have agreed to promptly take all necessary actions to ensure that CSM manage no fewer than 20 vessels. In the event of a vessel sale for which no replacement occurs within six months, CSM is entitled to a termination fee equal to $400 per day times the number of days remaining in the term. If we sell or otherwise dispose of vessels such that CSM provides commercial management services to fewer than 25 vessels, we are required to replace such vessels within three months. 
 The Company’s Indebtedness
See the section entitled “Description of Material Indebtedness” for a description of our long-term debt, consisting of credit facilities (revolving loans, term loans, and lines of credit). 
 Employees
We employ a staff of approximately 45 employees who provide services for the Company. Five of these employees are employed as the Company’s executive officers. 
 Our Customers
Our customers primarily include fully integrated oil companies (oil majors), refiners, oil traders, large oil distributors, governments and national oil companies and storage facility operators. Our tanker fleet is employed primarily in the spot and short duration time charter market. 
 We believe that developing strong relationships with the end users of the Company’s services allows us to better satisfy their needs with appropriate and capable vessels. A prospective customer’s financial condition, creditworthiness and reliability track record are important factors in negotiating our vessels’ employment. 
 We have derived, and may continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. However, for the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no charterers that accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 32.8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 Major Oil Company Vetting Process
Shipping in general, and crude oil and refined product tankers, in particular, have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. Many international and national rules, regulations and other requirements, whether imposed by the classification societies, international statutes (for example, the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS”), MARPOL, etc.), national and local administrations or industry, must be complied with in order to enable a shipping company to operate and a vessel to trade. 
 Traditionally there have been relatively few large players in the oil trading business and the industry is continuously consolidating. The so-called “oil majors companies,” such as BP, Chevron Corporation, ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, Statoil ASA, and Total S.A., together with a few smaller companies, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and, especially, shipping logistics (terminals) of crude and refined products worldwide. Concerns for the environment, health and safety have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel. 
 While a plethora of parameters are considered and evaluated prior to a commercial decision, the oil majors, through their association, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (“OCIMF”), have developed and are implementing two basic tools: (1) a Ship Inspection Report Programme (“SIRE”) and (2) the Tanker Management & Self-Assessment (“TMSA”) Program. The former is a physical ship inspection based upon a thorough vessel inspection questionnaire and performed by accredited OCIMF inspectors, resulting in a report being logged on SIRE, while the latter is a recent addition to the risk assessment tools used by the oil majors.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Based upon commercial needs, there are three levels of risk assessment used by the oil majors: (1) terminal use, which will clear a vessel to call at one of the oil major’s terminals; (2) voyage charter, which will clear the vessel for a single voyage; and (3) term charter, which will clear the vessel for use for an extended period of time. The depth, complexity and difficulty of each of these levels of assessment vary. Results of a recent SIRE inspection, the manager’s TMSA rating, the vessel’s current certification and recent operation history will be reviewed by a customer before using a vessel for a voyage charter. Additional scrutiny of the vessel, the manager and the owner will be undertaken in the case of a customer fixing a vessel for a time charter. A good safety and environmental record is essential to ensure that our vessels are acceptable to our customers. 
 The International Tanker Industry
All of the information and data provided in this section has been provided by Fearnleys AS (“Fearnleys”). The statistical and geographical information contained herein is drawn from Fearnleys’ database and other sources.
Oil remains the world’s primary energy source, and ocean freight by tanker vessels is often the most economically viable means of transportation between regions. The tanker market is broadly divided into two sub-segments: crude oil tankers and oil-products tankers. Crude tankers carry crude oil from the production and exporting area to refineries and/or storage at importing areas. Product tankers carry refined oil products from the refineries to areas closer to the end user.

 Market Dynamics
The cost of freight, or freight rate, is determined by supply and demand where supply is made up from the fleet size measured in deadweight tonne (dwt) carrying capacity, and demand is measured in tonne miles, made up from the amount of cargo carried multiplied with the sailing distance. Dayrates are usually expressed as a Time Charter Equivalent (TCE). There are multiple types of employment which a shipowner can find, as explained below. 
 •

  Spot market:   where the vessel earns a spot rate for an individual cargo and voyage. The rate is denoted in Worldscale points (WS) as a flat rate from which the TCE rate can be calculated by subtracting bunkers and port charges. The owner pays for all voyage and operating expenses and capital cost. 
 ​
 •

  Contract of affreightment (COA):   an agreement to transport a fixed quantity of cargo on a particular route over a determined period. This translates into a series of voyages, for which the owner might usually use different vessels. The owner pays for all voyage and operating expenses and capital cost. 
 ​

 •

  Time charter:   a contract for hire of a vessel for a determined period for a dollar per day rate. The owner pays for operating and capital costs, while the charterer pays for voyage costs. This structure could also include a profit split element above a certain rate level. 
 ​
 •

  Bareboat charter:   a contract for hire of a vessel for a determined period for a dollar per day rate. The charterer pays for all operating and voyage costs while the owner pays for capital costs. 
 ​
 Spot rates tend to be more volatile than the other employment types which to a certain extent reflect expectations for the rate outlook for a period of time ahead, but all types of rates usually correlate. Due to demand and supply cycles not always coinciding the tanker market tends to be highly cyclical. Just over the last five years the average annual Suezmax rates have ranged from $13k/day to $45k/day and similarly MR rates have ranged from $10k/day to almost $22k/day. Over the same period values for 5 year old Suezmaxes have ranged from $40 million to $60 million and MRs from $22.5 million to $29 million.

 Tanker Supply
The tanker fleet has grown steadily over time to match growing global oil trade. Supply growth is a function of the number of newbuilds delivered less the number of vessels retired. A tanker is normally built to operate for 25 years. Average retirement age is often found to be somewhat higher for the smaller vessels and lower for the larger vessel sizes. Every fifth year vessels need to go through a special survey to

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 ensure that they meet industry safety and technical standards and every 2.5 years after the age of 15 an additional intermediate survey is required. At each of these surveys some costs related to upgrades etc. can be expected, increasingly so as the vessel gets older. In softer earnings years owners will thus think twice before incurring additional costs to take a vessel through a fourth or fifth special survey rather than cashing in the vessel’s scrap value. As a result of this the scrap age tends to vary with market conditions. 
 Historical tanker fleet development

 ​

Source: Fearnleys 
 The crude tanker fleet is divided into four types of vessels based on carrying capacity including VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier), Suezmax, Aframax, and Panamax, and the product tanker market is divided into LR2 (Long Range 2), LR1, MR (Medium Range) and Handysize. The larger vessels are employed on the major trade lanes and longer distances whereas the smaller are more versatile and find a more diverse trading pattern. Product tanker vessels are generally more complex than crude tankers with added features such as coated tanks and heating coils to better preserve and avoid contamination of the products carried. 
 Crude tankers make up 73% of the total tanker fleet’s carrying capacity, and hence have the biggest impact on the market balance. As displayed below there is high correlation between the various vessel types. Whenever VLCC rates stretch too far ahead of Suezmax rates, on a relative basis, some charterers will split one VLCC cargo (2mbbls) into two Suezmaxes (1mbbls), and similarly Suezmaxes and Aframaxes compete for cargoes on certain trades. There is also high correlation from the crude tanker market into product tankers, with a time lag. LR2s are essentially Aframax tankers with coated tanks, which gives them added flexibility to switch into the dirty trade whenever rates are sufficiently higher here to cover costs related to the eventual switching back with a profit element on top. From LR2s on, the correlation trickles down also into LR1s and MRs which also do this switching into the dirty trade, and compete for some of the same cargoes on certain trades. Some crude tanker newbuilds also happen to lift a clean product cargo on the first voyage from Asia to the West and thus ‘eat into’ product tanker demand. 
 The tanker orderbook is currently at 8.5% of the total existing fleet, a historically low level following a few soft earnings years for tankers. There is uncertainty regarding how future emissions regulations coming in 2030 and 2050 will regulate CO2 and other types of emissions, and which fuel types will better meet these regulations. Few owners have therefore been willing to order new vessels running on traditional fuels and only some have ordered vessels with other solutions such as LNG and methanol. 
 At the same time a large portion of the fleet is aging. Some ~47m DWT will meet the fourth special survey at 20 years of age over the next 3 years — almost matching the total tonnage on order. It is not a certainty that all of these phase out candidates will be retired, especially not in a strong market experienced

 The Suezmax orderbook is thinning with 21 vessels scheduled for delivery in both 2020 and 2021, considerably lower than the recent peak at 51 vessels delivered in 2017, which was record high. There is also a high number of phase-out candidates with 41 and 14 vessels turning 20 years (average scrap age has been just above 20 in recent years) this and next year, respectively.

 Tanker Demand
Demand for tankers has grown in tandem with energy and oil demand globally over the years. Oil remains the world’s primary energy source. Despite losing relative market share over time (barring a recent uptick) oil consumption growth has been solid as the world’s energy demand has grown at a faster pace, driven in large part by the economic expansion and improved living standards in the Far East. For tanker demand there is a difference between oil demand and supply, where production growth is the main driver as added volumes are largely either exported or stored, sometimes on tankers depending on onshore capacity. Oil demand growth can be met from a mix of production and drawdown of inventories.

 Seaborne oil trade has gone through a transition over the last decade, impacted by a shift in oil production growth toward the Atlantic basin, driven to a large extent by US shale oil. A growing Atlantic surplus of crude and fuel oil has been shipped to Asia where the incremental demand is located, boosting ton-mile demand. In addition to the trend for general oil consumption growth shifting toward the East, most new refinery capacity has been built there in recent years. The demand and pricing picture is ever more complex, creating interesting arbitrage opportunities and new trading patterns, including for product tankers.

 IMO 2020
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set a new limit for sulphur oxide emissions at 0.5% M/M (mass by mass) from January 1, 2020 under a revised MARPOL Annex VI (“IMO 2020”). This intends to reduce the emissions from global shipping for health and environment benefits. Consequently, ships on the water now must either use compliant fuels, primarily very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and marine gasoil (MGO), or exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) which ‘clean’ the emissions. There are also other alternative fuels and propulsion types being developed, but the uptake for tankers has thus far been limited. Compliant fuels have historically been priced at a premium to heavy fuel oil (HFO), the go-to fuel ahead of the new regulations, hence entailing a benefit for those owners who have installed scrubbers and can use the cheaper HFO. 
 Tax Considerations
The following is a discussion of the material Marshall Islands and United States federal income tax considerations relevant to owning our common stock by a United States Holder or a Non-United States Holder, each as defined below. This discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning our common stock to all categories of investors, some of which (such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons who are investors in pass-through entities, dealers in securities or currencies, persons required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is reported on an “applicable financial statement,” persons who own, directly or constructively, 10% or more of our common stock, persons subject to the “base erosion and anti-avoidance” tax and investors whose functional currency is not the United States dollar) may be subject to special rules. This discussion deals only with holders who own the common stock as a capital asset. Shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising in their own particular situation under United States federal, state, local or foreign law of the ownership of our common stock. 
 Marshall Islands Tax Considerations
In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, the following are the material Marshall Islands tax consequences of our activities to us and shareholders of our common stock. We are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Under current Marshall Islands law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains, and no Marshall Islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders. 
 United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
In the opinion of Seward & Kissel LLP, our United States tax counsel, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to United States Holders and to Non- United States Holders (each as defined below) of our common stock. The following discussion of United States federal income tax matters is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, the discussion below is based, in part, on the description of our business as described in “Item 1. Business” in this Annual Report and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section. 
 United States Federal Income Taxation of Our Company
 Taxation of Operating Income: In General.   The Company currently earns, and anticipates that it will continue to earn, substantially all its income from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time or voyage charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses, all of which we refer to as “shipping income.”

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Unless exempt from United States federal income taxation under the rules of Section 883 of the Code (“Section 883”), as discussed below, a foreign corporation such as ourselves will be subject to United States federal income taxation on its “shipping income” that is treated as derived from sources within the United States, to which we refer as “United States source shipping income.” For tax purposes, “United States source shipping income” includes 50% of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States. 
 Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-United States ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States. Shipping income derived from sources outside the United States will not be subject to any United States federal income tax. 
 Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between United States ports is considered to be 100% derived from United States sources. However, the Company is not permitted by United States law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces 100% United States source income. 
 Unless exempt from tax under Section 883, the Company’s gross United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below. 
  Exemption of Operating Income from United States Federal Income Taxation.   Under Section 883 and the regulations thereunder, a foreign corporation will be exempt from United States federal income taxation on its United States source shipping income if: 
 •

 it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an “equivalent exemption” from tax to corporations organized in the United States in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883 and to which we refer as the “Country of Organization Test”; and 
 ​
 •

 one of the following tests is met: 
 ​
 •

 more than 50% of the value of its shares is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which as defined includes individuals who are “residents” of a qualified foreign country, to which we refer as the “50% Ownership Test”; 
 ​
 •

 subject to an exception for closely-held corporations, its shares are “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in a qualified foreign country or in the United States, to which we refer as the “Publicly-Traded Test”; or 
 ​
 •

 it is a “controlled foreign corporation” and satisfies an ownership test, to which, collectively, we refer to as the “CFC Test.” 
 ​
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, the jurisdiction where the Company is incorporated, has been officially recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite “equivalent exemption” from tax in respect of each category of shipping income the Company earns and currently expects to earn in the future. Therefore, the Company will be exempt from United States federal income taxation with respect to its United States source shipping income if it satisfies any one of the 50% Ownership Test, the Publicly-Traded Test, or the CFC Test. 
 For the 2019 taxable year, we believe that we satisfy the Publicly-Traded Test, as discussed in more detail below. We do not currently anticipate a circumstance under which we would be able to satisfy the 50% Ownership Test or the CFC Test. 
 Publicly-Traded Test
The regulations under Section 883 provide, in pertinent part, that shares of a foreign corporation will be considered to be “primarily traded” on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of shares that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. The Company’s common stock, which is its sole class of issued and outstanding shares, are “primarily traded” on the NYSE. 
 Under the regulations, the Company’s common stock will be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market if one or more classes of its shares representing more than 50% of its outstanding 

 
 17


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 shares, by both total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote and total value, are listed on such market, to which we refer as the “listing threshold.” Since our common stock, which is our sole class of issued and outstanding shares, is listed on the NYSE, we believe that we satisfy the listing threshold. 
 It is further required that with respect to each class of shares relied upon to meet the listing threshold, (i) such class of shares is traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year or one-sixth of the days in a short taxable year; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of such class of shares traded on such market during the taxable year is at least 10% of the average number of shares of such class of shares outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year. We believe the Company will satisfy the trading frequency and trading volume tests. Even if this were not the case, the regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if, as is the case with the Company’s common stock, such class of shares is traded on an established market in the United States and such shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such shares. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the regulations provide, in pertinent part, that a class of shares will not be considered to be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for any taxable year in which 50% or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of such class are owned, actually or constructively under specified share attribution rules, on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own 5% or more of the vote and value of such class of outstanding shares, to which we refer as the “5 Percent Override Rule.” 
 For purposes of being able to determine the persons who actually or constructively own 5% or more of the vote and value of the Company’s common stock, or 5% Shareholders, the regulations permit the Company to rely on those persons that are identified on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D filings with the SEC, as owning 5% or more of the Company’s common stock. The regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, will not be treated as a 5% Shareholder for such purposes. 
 In the event the 5 Percent Override Rule is triggered, the regulations provide that the 5 Percent Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if the Company can establish that within the group of 5% Shareholders, there are sufficient qualified shareholders for purposes of Section 883 to preclude non-qualified shareholders in such group from owning 50% or more of the Company’s common stock for more than half the number of days during the taxable year, which we refer to as the “5 Percent Override Exception.” 
 Based on the ownership and trading of our stock in 2019, we believe that we satisfied the publicly traded test and qualified for the Section 883 exemption in 2019. Even if we do qualify for the Section 883 exemption in 2019, there can be no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for the Section 883 exemption in future taxable years. 
 Taxation in Absence of Section 883 Exemption
If the benefits of Section 883 are unavailable, the Company’s United States source shipping income would be subject to a 4% tax imposed by Section 887 of the Code on a gross basis, without the benefit of deductions, to the extent that such income is not considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below. Since under the sourcing rules described above, no more than 50% of the Company’s shipping income would be treated as being United States source shipping income, the maximum effective rate of United States federal income tax on our shipping income would never exceed 2% under the 4% gross basis tax regime. However, we can give no assurance that the operation of our vessels, which are under the control of third party charterers, will not change such that our United States federal income tax liability would be substantially higher. 
 To the extent the Company’s United States source shipping income is considered to be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business, as described below, any such “effectively connected” United States source shipping income, net of applicable deductions, would be subject to United States federal income tax, currently imposed at a rate of 21%. In addition, the Company may be subject to the 30% “branch profits” tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 determined after allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of the Company’s United States trade or business. 
 The Company’s United States source shipping income would be considered “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business only if: 
 •

 the Company has, or is considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in the earning of United States source shipping income; and 
 ​
 •

 substantially all of the Company’s United States source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the United States. 
 ​
 The Company did not have any vessel sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis during its 2019 taxable year. The Company does not intend to have, or permit circumstances that would result in having, any such vessels in future taxable years, but there can be no assurances that this will be the case. Based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of the Company’s shipping operations and other activities, the Company believes that none of its United States source shipping income will be “effectively connected” with the conduct of a United States trade or business for its 2019 taxable year or any future taxable year. 
 United States Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels
Assuming that any decision on a vessel sale is made from and attributable to the United States office of the Company, as we believe likely to be the case as the Company is currently structured, then any gain derived from the sale of any such vessel will be treated as derived from United States sources and subject to United States federal income tax as “effectively connected” income (determined under rules different from those discussed above) under the above described net income tax regime. If the Company were to qualify for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of the shipping income derived from the international operation of its vessels, then gain from the sale of any such vessel should likewise be exempt from tax under Section 883. 
 United States Federal Income Taxation of United States Holders
As used herein, the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is an individual United States citizen or resident, a United States corporation or other United States entity taxable as a corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust (i) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) if it has elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. 
 Distributions
Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below, any distributions made by the Company with respect to its common stock to a United States Holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the United States Holder’s tax basis in his common stock on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain. Because the Company is not a United States corporation, United States Holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us. Dividends paid with respect to the Company’s common stock will generally be treated as “passive category income” for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for United States foreign tax credit purposes.

 Dividends paid on the Company’s common stock to a United States Holder who is an individual, trust or estate (a “United States Non-Corporate Holder”) will generally be treated as “qualified dividend income” that is taxable to such United States Non-Corporate Holder at preferential tax rates provided that (1) the common stock is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE on which the Company’s common stock is traded); (2) the Company is not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been, are or will be); (3) the United States Non-Corporate Holder has owned the common stock for more than 60 days in the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex-dividend; and (4) the United States Non-Corporate Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. 
 There is no assurance that any dividends paid on the Company’s common stock will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a United States Non-Corporate Holder, although we believe that they will be so eligible. Any dividends out of earnings, and profits the Company pays, which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a United States Non-Corporate Holder. 
 Special rules may apply to any “extraordinary dividend” — generally, a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of 10% of a shareholder’s adjusted basis in a common share — paid by the Company. If the Company pays an “extraordinary dividend” on its common stock that is treated as “qualified dividend income,” then any loss derived by a United States Non-Corporate Holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend. 
 Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock
Assuming the Company does not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the United States Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the United States Holder’s tax basis in such stock. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the United States Holder’s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source income or loss, as applicable, for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gains of United States Non-Corporate Holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. A United States Holder’s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations. 
 Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences
Special United States federal income tax rules apply to a United States Holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a “passive foreign investment company” for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, the Company will be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to a United States Holder if, for any taxable year in which such holder holds the Company’s common stock, either: 
 •

 at least 75% of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or 
 ​
 •

 at least 50% of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. 
 ​
 Income earned, or deemed earned, by the Company in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income would generally constitute “passive income” unless the Company was treated under specific rules as deriving its rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business. 
 Based on the Company’s current operations and future projections, we do not believe that the Company has been or is, nor do we expect the Company to become, a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year. Although there is no legal authority directly on point, our belief is based principally on the position that, for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company, the gross income it derives from its time chartering and voyage chartering activities should constitute 

 
 20


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, such income should not constitute passive income, and the assets that the Company owns and operates in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company. 
 We believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes. However, there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. In addition, we have obtained an opinion from our counsel, Seward & Kissel LLP, that, based upon the Company’s operations as described herein, its income from time charters and voyage charters should not be treated as passive income for purposes of determining whether it is a passive foreign investment company. However, in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing passive foreign investment companies, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although the Company intends to conduct its affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of its operations will not change in the future. 
 As discussed more fully below, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the United States Holder makes an election to treat the Company as a “Qualified Electing Fund,” which election we refer to as a “QEF election.” As an alternative to making a QEF election, a United States Holder should be able to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to the Company’s common stock, as discussed below. In addition, if we were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company, a United States holder would be required to file an annual report with the IRS for that year with respect to such holder’s common stock. 
 Taxation of United States Holders Making a Timely QEF Election
If a United States Holder makes a timely QEF election, which United States Holder we refer to as an “Electing Holder,” the Electing Holder must report for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the Company’s ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for each taxable year of the Company for which it is a passive foreign investment company that ends with or within the taxable year of the Electing Holder, regardless of whether or not distributions were received from the Company by the Electing Holder. No portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as “qualified dividend income.” Net capital gain inclusions of United States Non-Corporate Holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates. The Electing Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common stock and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that the Company incurs with respect to any year. An Electing Holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock. A United States Holder would make a timely QEF election for shares of the Company by filing one copy of IRS Form 8621 with his United States federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when the Company was a passive foreign investment company. If the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, the Company would provide each United States Holder with all necessary information in order to make the QEF election described above. 
 Taxation of United States Holders Making a “Mark-to-Market” Election
Alternatively, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year and, as we anticipate, its shares are treated as “marketable stock”, a United States Holder would be allowed to make a “mark-to-market” election with respect to the Company’s common stock, provided the United States Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions and related Treasury regulations. If that election is made, the United States Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the 

 
 21


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 common stock at the end of the taxable year over such holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock. The United States Holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A United States Holder’s tax basis in his common stock would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included by the United States Holder. No income inclusions under this election will be treated as “qualified dividend income.” 
 Taxation of United States Holders Not Making a Timely QEF or Mark-to-Market Election
Finally, if the Company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year, a United States Holder who does not make either a QEF election or a “mark-to-market” election for that year, whom we refer to as a “Non-Electing Holder,” would be subject to special rules with respect to (1) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder on the common stock in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the Non-Electing Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the Non-Electing Holder’s holding period for the common stock), and (2) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock. Under these special rules: 
 •

 the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the Non-Electing Holder’s aggregate holding period for the common stock; 
 ​
 •

 the amount allocated to the current taxable year, and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which the Company was a passive foreign investment company, would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be “qualified dividend income”; and 
 ​
 •

 the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. 
 ​
 These special rules would not apply to a qualified pension, profit sharing or other retirement trust or other tax-exempt organization that did not borrow money or otherwise utilize leverage in connection with its acquisition of the Company’s common stock. If the Company is a passive foreign investment company and a Non-Electing Holder who is an individual dies while owning the Company’s common stock, such holder’s successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect to such shares. 
 United States Federal Income Taxation of “Non-United States Holders”
A beneficial owner of common stock (other than a partnership) that is not a United States Holder is referred to herein as a “Non-United States Holder”. 
 If a partnership holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock, you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor. 
 Dividends on Common Stock
Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from the Company with respect to its common stock, unless that income is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the Non-United States Holder is entitled to the benefits of a United States income tax treaty with respect to those dividends, that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder in the United States.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Stock
Non-United States Holders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s common stock, unless: 
 •

 The gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if the Non-United States holder is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty with respect to that gain, that gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States holder in the United States); or 
 ​
 •

 The Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met. 
 ​
 If the Non-United States Holder is engaged in a United States trade or business for United States federal income tax purposes, the income from the common stock, including dividends and the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of the shares, that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to regular United States federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of United States Holders. In addition, if you are a corporate Non-United States Holder, your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income, which are subject to certain adjustments, may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30%, or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. 
 Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, dividend payments, or other taxable distributions, made within the United States to you will be subject to information reporting requirements if you are a non-corporate United States Holder. Such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding tax if you are a non-corporate United States Holder and you: 
 •

 Fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number; 
 ​
 •

 Are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns; or 
 ​
 •

 In certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements. 
 ​
 Non-United States Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their status on an appropriate IRS Form W-8. 
 If you are a Non-United States Holder and you sell your common stock to or through a United States office of a broker, the payment of the proceeds is subject to both United States backup withholding and information reporting unless you certify that you are a non-United States person, under penalties of perjury, or you otherwise establish an exemption. If you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a non-United States broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, United States information reporting requirements, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made to you outside the United States, if you sell your common stock through a non-United States office of a broker that is a United States person or has some other contacts with the United States. Such information reporting requirements will not apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a non-United States person and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption. 
 Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS. 
 Individuals who are United States Holders (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, certain United States entities and Non-United States Holders) who hold “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) are required to file IRS Form 8938 with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $75,000 at any time

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 during the taxable year or $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year (or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable Treasury regulations). Specified foreign financial assets would include, among other assets, our common shares, unless the shares are held through an account maintained with a United States financial institution. Substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file IRS Form 8938, unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Additionally, in the event an individual United States Holder (and to the extent specified in applicable Treasury regulations, a United States entity and Non-United States Holders) that is required to file IRS Form 8938 does not file such form, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of United States federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed. United States Holders (including United States entities) and Non-United States Holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding their reporting obligations under this legislation. 
 Competition
We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on the supply of tanker vessels and the demand for seaborne transportation. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location, size and condition of the vessel. We compete primarily with other independent tanker vessel owners and with major oil companies that own and operate their own vessels. Our competitors may have more resources than we do and may operate vessels that are newer, than our vessels. Ownership of tanker vessels is highly fragmented and is divided among publicly listed companies, state-controlled owners and private shipowners. 
 We believe our ability to comply better with the rigorous standards of major oil companies relative to less qualified or experienced operators allows us to effectively compete for new charters. 
 Seasonality
Our tankers operate in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand and, therefore, in spot charter rates. This seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results of operations. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the winter months and spring season as a result of increased oil consumption used for heating in the northern hemisphere, and stock building of refined products in advance of the summer season, respectively, and weaker in the summer months as stocks decline. Additionally, unpredictable weather patterns during the winter months tend to disrupt vessel routing and scheduling, which historically has increased oil price volatility and oil trading activities in the winter. We cannot guarantee that the historical seasonal variations will exist in the future. However, vessels operating in the time charter market are not generally subject to the effect of these seasonable variations in demand. 
 Properties
We do not own any real property other than our vessels. We lease office space at 33 Benedict Place, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830. 
 Environmental and Other Regulations
Government laws and regulations significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. A variety of government, quasi-governmental and private organizations subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These organizations include the local port authorities, national authorities, harbor masters or equivalent entities, classification societies, relevant flag state (country of registry), labor organizations and charterers, particularly terminal operators and oil companies. Some of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and approvals for the operation of our vessels. Our failure to maintain necessary permits, licenses, certificates or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of the vessels or invalidate our insurance coverage. 
 Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for tankers that conform to stricter environmental standards and those standards are set to increase in stringency in the short to medium term. We are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety, quality maintenance, continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with applicable local, national and international environmental laws and regulations. We believe the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all 

 
 24


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. 
 We and our technical manager are also operating in compliance with several ISO standards and in accordance with the ISM Code and maintain the documents of compliance to manage tankers. The Company’s technical managers have obtained the ISO 9001 (quality management systems), ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and ISO 18001 certifications (occupational health and safety management systems) in accordance with the standards of the ISO. 
 International Maritime Organization
The IMO is the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by ships. The IMO has adopted several international conventions that regulate the international shipping industry, including but not limited to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, generally referred to as CLC, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973, or the MARPOL Convention. The MARPOL Convention is broken down into six Annexes, each of which establishes environmental standards relating to different sources of pollution: Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997. 
 In 2012, the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee (the “MEPC”) adopted a resolution amending the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (the “IBC Code”). The provisions of the IBC Code are mandatory under MARPOL and the SOLAS Convention. These amendments, which entered into force in June 2014, pertain to revised international certificates of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in bulk and identifying new products that fall under the IBC Code as well as reclassification of existing products under the amended IBC Code. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments. 
 In 2013, the MEPC adopted a resolution amending MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment Scheme (“CAS”). These amendments became effective on October 1, 2014, and require compliance with the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, which provides for enhanced inspection programs for vessels at or older than 15 years of age. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments. 
 Air Emissions
In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution from vessels. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed (or underwent major conversions) on or after January 1, 2000. It also prohibits “deliberate emissions” of “ozone depleting substances,” defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons. The MEPC adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding emissions of sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and ozone depleting substances, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution from vessels by, among other things, implementing a progressive phased reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, the MEPC agreed to implement a global 0.5% m/m sulfur oxide emissions limit (reduced from 3.50%) starting from January 1, 2020. 
 This limitation can be met by using low-sulfur compliant fuel oil, alternative fuels, or certain exhaust gas cleaning systems. Following the effectiveness of Annex VI on January 1, 2020, ships are required to obtain bunker delivery notes and International Air Pollution Prevention (“IAPP”) Certificates from their flag states that specify sulfur content. Additionally, at MEPC 73, amendments to Annex VI to prohibit the carriage of bunkers above 0.5% sulfur on ships were adopted and took effect March 1, 2020. These regulations subject ocean-going vessels to stringent emissions controls, and may cause us to incur additional costs to comply. 

 
 25


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Shipowners can meet the new requirements by continuing to use fuel types which exceed the 0.5% sulfur limit and retrofitting an approved Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (also known as scrubbers) to remove sulfur from exhaust, which can require a substantial capital expenditure and prolonged offhire of the vessel during installation; or use petroleum fuels such as marine gasoil, which meet the 0.5% sulfur limit. Several technology options exist for disposal of the waste stream created through operation of exhaust gas scrubbers; open loop, closed loop, or hybrid type. Coastal states and local port authorities may prohibit the direct overboard disposal of such wastes or restrict their transfer from the vessel to shore based facilities. 
 Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”). As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.1% m/m. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the IMO has designated four ECAs, including specified portions of the Baltic Sea area, North Sea area, North American area and United States Caribbean area. Ocean-going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emission controls and may cause the Company to incur additional costs. Other areas in China are subject to local regulations that impose stricter emission controls. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations. 
 Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine diesel engines, depending on their date of installation. At the MEPC meeting held from March to April 2014, amendments to Annex VI were adopted which address the date on which Tier III Nitrogen Oxide (“NOx”) standards in ECAs will go into effect. Under the amendments, Tier III NOx standards apply to ships that operate in the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECAs to control NOx emissions on ships with a marine diesel engine installed and constructed on or after January 1, 2016. Tier III requirements could apply to areas that will be designated for Tier III NOx in the future. At MEPC 70 and MEPC 71, the MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxide for ships built on or after January 1, 2021. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in 2010. As a result of these designations or similar future designations, we may be required to incur additional operating or other costs. 
 As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships. All ships are now required to develop and implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (“SEEMPS”), and new ships must be designed in compliance with minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile as defined by the Energy Efficiency Design Index. Under these measures, by 2025, all new ships built will be 30% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. 
 We may incur costs to comply with these revised standards. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Safety Management System Requirements
The IMO also adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the International Convention on Load Lines which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships. The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS and the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966 (the “LL Convention”) standards. The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the “LLMC”) sets limitations of liability for a loss of life or personal injury claim or a property claim against ship owners. We believe that all of our vessels are in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LL Convention standards. 
 Our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements contained in the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO under Chapter IX of SOLAS. The ISM Code requires the owner of a vessel, or any person who has taken responsibility for operation of a vessel, to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures 

 
 26


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that has been developed for our vessels for compliance with the ISM Code. 
 The ISM Code requires that vessel operators also obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s management with code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a safety management certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code, which our technical managers have obtained. 
 Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in, or invalidation of, available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) and European Union (“EU”) authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by the applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and EU ports, as the case may be. 
 Our technical managers have obtained applicable documents of compliance and safety management certificates for all of our vessels to the extent required by the IMO. 
 Amendments to SOLAS Chapter VII apply to vessels transporting dangerous goods and require those vessels be in compliance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (the “IMDG Code”). Effective January 1, 2018, the IMDG Code includes (1) updates to the provisions for radioactive material, reflecting the latest provisions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, (2) new marking, packing and classification requirements for dangerous goods, and (3) new mandatory training requirements. Amendments which took effect on January 1, 2020 also reflect the latest material from the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, including (1) new provisions regarding IMP type 9 tank, (2) new abbreviations for segregation groups, and (3) special provisions for carriage of lithium batteries and of vehicles powered by flammable liquid or gas. 
 The IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee and MEPC, respectively, each adopted relevant parts of the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Water (the “Polar Code”). The Polar Code, which entered into force on January 1, 2017, covers design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue as well as environmental protection matters relevant to ships operating in the waters surrounding the two poles. It also includes mandatory measures regarding safety and pollution prevention as well as recommendatory provisions. The Polar Code applies to new ships constructed after January 1, 2017, and after January 1, 2018, ships constructed before January 1, 2017 are required to meet the relevant requirements by the earlier of their first intermediate or renewal survey, if the vessels are intending to operate in polar waters. 
 Pollution Control and Liability Requirements
The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatory nations to such conventions. For example, the IMO adopted the BWM Convention in 2004 which entered into force on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits, and require all ships to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. 
 On December 4, 2013, the IMO passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention that, in effect, made all vessels delivered before the entry into force date “existing vessels” and allows for the installation of ballast water management systems on such vessels at the first IOPP renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. Presently, vessels over 400 gross tons generally must comply with a “D-1 standard,” requiring the exchange of ballast water only in open seas and away from coastal waters. The “D-2 standard” specifies the maximum amount of viable organisms allowed to be discharged, and compliance dates vary depending on the IOPP renewal dates. Depending on the date of the IOPP renewal survey, existing vessels must comply with the D-2 standard on or after September 8, 2019. 

 
 27


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 For most ships, compliance with the D-2 standard involves installing on-board systems to treat ballast water and eliminate unwanted organisms. Ballast water management systems, which include systems that make use of chemical, biocides, organisms or biological mechanisms, or which alter the chemical or physical characteristics of the ballast water, must be approved in accordance with IMO Guidelines (Regulation D-3). As of October 13, 2019, MEPC 72’s amendments to the BWM Convention took effect, making the Code for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems, which governs assessment of ballast water management systems, mandatory rather than permissive, and formalized an implementation schedule for the D-2 standard. Under these amendments, all ships must meet the D-2 standard by September 8, 2024. Costs of establishing and maintaining compliance may be substantial. 
 Once mid-ocean ballast or exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory under the BWM Convention, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and may be material. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The United States, for example, requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. 
 The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000 (the “CLC”). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel’s registered owner may be strictly liable, subject to certain affirmative defenses, for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability, expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit of Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s intentional or reckless act or omission where the shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships over 2,000 tons covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner’s liability for a single incident. We believe that our protection and indemnity insurance will cover the liability under the plan adopted by the IMO. 
 The IMO also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or Bunker Convention, to impose strict liability on shipowners for pollution damage, including the cost of preventative measures, in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. P&I Associations (as defined below) in the International Group issue the required Bunkers Convention “Blue Cards” to provide evidence that there is in place insurance meeting the liability requirements. All of our vessels have received “Blue Cards” from their P&I Associations and are in possession of a CLC state-issued certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force. 
 IMO regulations also require owners and operators of vessels to adopt shipboard marine pollution emergency plans and/or shipboard marine pollution emergency plans for both petroleum cargoes as well as noxious liquid substances in accordance with the guidelines developed by the IMO. 
 Compliance Enforcement
Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels, may result in the suspension or removal of the vessels regulatory trading documents, which may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The USCG and EU authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the applicable IMO conventions by the applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and EU ports, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, each of our vessels are certified in accordance with applicable IMO conventions, however, there can be no assurance that such certificates can be maintained in the future. The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have our operations.

 U.S. Regulations
The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”)
OPA established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade or operate with the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S. territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. The United States has also enacted CERCLA which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel. Accordingly, both OPA and CERCLA impact the Company’s operations. 
 Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels, including bunkers (fuel). 
 OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages other than those related to; direct cleanup costs. Effective November 12, 2019, the USCG adjusted the limits of OPA liability such that for a tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, over 3,000 gross tons liability is limited to the greater of $2,300 per gross ton or $19,943,400 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (1) report the incident as required by law where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (2) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (3) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311(c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act. 
 CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels can be held liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damages for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing the same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA. 
 OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Under the regulations, evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety bond, self-insurance or guaranty. An owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum liability under OPA. Each of our shipowning subsidiaries that has vessels trading in U.S. waters has applied for, and obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard National Pollution Funds Center, three-year certificates of financial responsibility (“COFR”), supported by guarantees, which the Company purchased from an insurance based provider. We believe that we will be able to continue to obtain the requisite guarantees and that we will continue to be granted COFRs from the USCG for each of our vessels that is required to have one. 
 Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Additional

 legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business. 
 OPA specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, provided they accept, at a minimum, the levels of liability established under OPA and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills. Many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. Some of these laws are more stringent than U.S. federal law. Moreover, some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters, although in some cases, states which have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining tanker owners’ responsibilities under these laws. We intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call. 
 Through our P&I Association membership, we expect to maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Other U.S. Environmental Initiatives
The U.S. Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. 
 The EPA and the USCG have also enacted rules relating to ballast water discharge, compliance with which requires the installation of equipment on the Company’s vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial costs, and/or otherwise restrict the Company’s vessels from entering U.S. waters. The EPA will regulate these ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within United States waters pursuant to the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”), which was signed into law on December 4, 2018 and replaces the 2013 Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) program (which authorizes discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers, and requirements for the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants) and current Coast Guard ballast water management regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”), such as mid-ocean ballast exchange programs and installation of approved USCG technology for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks bound for U.S. ports or entering U.S. waters. VIDA establishes a new framework for the regulation of vessel incidental discharges under Clean Water Act (CWA), requires the EPA to develop performance standards for those discharges within two years of enactment, and requires the U.S. Coast Guard to develop implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations within two years of EPA’s promulgation of standards. Under VIDA, all provisions of the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations regarding ballast water treatment remain in force and effect until the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard regulations are finalized. VIDA requires that EPA develop national standards of performance for approximately 30 discharges, similar to those found in the VGP, within two years. By approximately 2022, the U.S. Coast Guard must develop corresponding implementation, compliance and enforcement regulations regarding ballast water. 
 The new regulations could require the installation of new equipment, which may cause us to incur substantial costs. Non-military, non-recreational vessels greater than 79 feet in length must continue to comply with the requirements of the VGP, including submission of a Notice of Intent (“NOI”) or retention of a PARI form and submission of annual reports. We have submitted NOIs for our vessels where required. Compliance with the EPA, U.S. Coast Guard and state regulations could require the installation of ballast water treatment equipment on our vessels or the implementation of other port facility disposal procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters.

 Sanctions or Restrictive Regimes
The expanded scope of U.S. sanctions in recent years has affected non-U.S. companies. In particular, sanctions against Iran have been significantly expanded. In 2012, for example, the U.S. signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“TRA”), which placed further restrictions on the ability of non-U.S. companies to do business or trade with Iran and Syria. A major provision in the TRA is that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February 6, 2013 if the issuer or “any affiliate” has “knowingly” engaged in certain activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. This disclosure obligation is broad in scope in that it requires the reporting of activity that would not be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions as well as violative conduct, and is not subject to a materiality threshold. The SEC publishes these disclosures on its website and the U.S. President must initiate an investigation in response to all disclosures. 
 In addition to the sanctions against Iran, the U.S. also has sanctions that target other countries, entities and individuals. These sanctions have certain extraterritorial effects that need to be considered by non-U.S. companies. It should also be noted that other governments have implemented sanctions. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations imposed by the U.S., the United Nations or EU countries and intend to maintain such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to not invest or divest their interest in the Company. Additionally, some investors may decide to not invest or divest their interest in the Company simply because we may do business with companies that do business in sanctioned countries. Investor perception of the value of our shares may also be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries. 
 European Union Regulations
In October 2009, EU Directive 2009/123/EC (amending Directive 2005/35/EC) imposed criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. Regulation (EU) 2015/757 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 (amending EU Directive 2009/16/EC) governs the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport, and, subject to some exclusions, requires companies with ships over 5,000 gross tonnage to monitor and report carbon dioxide emissions annually, which may cause us to incur additional expenses. 
 The EU has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The EU also adopted and extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the EU with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. Furthermore, the EU has implemented regulations requiring vessels to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. The EU Directive 2005/33/EC (amending Directive 1999/32/EC) introduced requirements parallel to those in Annex VI relating to the sulfur content of marine fuels. In addition, the EU imposed a 0.1% maximum sulfur requirement for fuel used by ships at berth in the Baltic, the North Sea and the English Channel (the so called “SOx-Emission Control Area”). As of January 2020, EU member states must also ensure that ships in all EU waters, except the SOx-Emission Control Area, use fuels with a 0.5% maximum sulfur content. 
 As mentioned above, the EU has restrictive measures (so-called ‘sanctions’) in place relating to a variety of persons, entities, groups or organizations and jurisdictions. We believe that we are in compliance with those sanctions but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation

 could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to not invest or divest their interest in the Company. 
 In 2018, the EU expanded the scope of its Blocking Regulation — Council Regulation (EC) No. 2271/ 96 of 22 November 1996, in reaction to the United States’ withdrawal from the JCPOA and the associated re-imposition of various sanctions on Iran. The scope of the Blocking Regulation was expanded by including certain U.S. sanctions that were lifted or waived following the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (“JCPOA”) and which have been re-imposed. The Blocking Regulation already covered certain other U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Libya. EU operators are prohibited from complying with the blocked U.S. sanctions. Any violation can give rise to enforcement actions and result in the imposition of penalties. EU operators are also entitled to recover any damages from anyone causing damage to that person by the application of the blocked sanctions or by actions based thereon or resulting therefrom, or from any person acting on its behalf or intermediary. The Blocking Regulation can give rise to conflicting obligations under EU and U.S. legislation. It can also give rise to risks of claims for damages by EU operators when companies or natural persons act in compliance with the blocked sanctions of the United States. 
 We believe that we are in compliance with the EU’s Blocking Regulation, to the extent it would be applicable to our operations, and we are not aware of any enforcement actions or claims for damages on the basis of the EU’s Blocking Regulation. However, there can be no assurance that we will in the future be in compliance and will not face such claims for damages, particularly in view of the possible conflict of laws and as the exact restrictions of the Blocking Regulation may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and any such violation or claim for damages could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to not invest or divest their interest in the Company. 
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation
Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with targets extended through 2020. International negotiations are continuing with respect to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, and restrictions on shipping emissions may be included in any new treaty. In December 2009, more than 27 nations, including the U.S. and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in the Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016 and does not directly limit greenhouse gas emissions from ships. The U.S. initially entered into the agreement, but on June 1, 2017, the U.S. President announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process, meaning that the earliest possible effective withdrawal date cannot be before November 4, 2020. The timing and effect of such action has yet to be determined. 
 The EU made a unilateral commitment to reduce its member states’ overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states from 20% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period from 2013 to 2020. Since January 2018, large ships over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports have been required to collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. 
 In the United States, the EPA issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety, adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources, and proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from large stationary sources. However, in March 2017, the President signed an executive order to review and eliminate certain EPA initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Regulatory rules to implement elements of this order have been proposed and the outcome of these efforts are not yet known. Further, in August 2019, the Administration announced plans to weaken regulations for methane emissions. Additionally, although mobile source and electric utility emissions regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, the EPA or individual U.S. states could enact environmental regulations that would affect our operations. For example, California has introduced a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to reduce emissions 40% by 2030.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, the EU, the United States or other countries where the Company operates, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol or Paris Agreement, that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time. Even in the absence of climate control legislation, our business may be indirectly affected to the extent that climate change may result in sea level changes or more intense weather events. 
 Vessel Security Regulations
Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. On November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) came into effect. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA. 
 Similarly, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention imposes detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, or the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. 
 To trade internationally, a vessel must obtain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. Ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained, expelled from, or refused entry at port until they obtain an ISSC. The following are among the various requirements, some of which are found in the SOLAS Convention: on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status; 
 •

 on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore; 
 ​
 •

 the development of vessel security plans; 
 ​
 •

 ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull; 
 ​
 •

 a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history, including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; 
 ​
 •

 compliance with flag state security requirements; and 
 ​
 •

 ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or it may be expelled from port, or refused entry at port. 
 ​
 The USCG regulations, intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards, exempt from MTSA vessel security measures non-U.S. vessels, provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures addressed by MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code, and our fleet is in compliance with applicable security requirements. Future security measures could have a significant financial impact on the Company. 
 The cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in the frequency of acts of piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia, including the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea area. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of detention of a vessel or additional security measures, and the risk of uninsured losses could significantly affect our business. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures in accordance with Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP5 industry standard.

 Vessel Recycling & the IMO Hong Kong Convention
The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (the “Hong Kong Convention”) is a multilateral convention that aims to ensure vessels, being recycled once they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health, and safety. The Hong Kong Convention has yet to be ratified by the required number of countries to enter into force. Upon the Hong Kong Convention’s entry into force, however, each commercial vessel over 500 gross tonnes sent for recycling will have to carry an inventory of its hazardous materials. The hazardous materials, whose use or installation is prohibited in certain circumstances, are listed in an appendix to the Hong Kong Convention. Vessels will be required to have surveys to verify their inventory of hazardous materials initially, throughout their lives, and prior to the vessels being recycled. The Hong Kong Convention will enter into force 24 months after the date on which 15 IMO Member States, representing 40% of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage, have ratified or approved accession. 
 Inspection by Classification Societies
Every internationally traded seagoing vessel must be “classed” by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built to and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. 
 For maintenance of the class, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows: 
 •

  Annual Surveys.   For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. 
 ​
 •

  Intermediate Surveys.   Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and after each class renewal survey. Intermediate hull surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey and typically consist of ballast and cargo tank internal examinations, the scope of which are vessel age dependent. 
 ​
 •

  Class Renewal Surveys.   Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at five year intervals. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. The classification society permits a 15 month grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear or structural corrosion beyond allowable limits. In lieu of the execution of the entire special survey every five years, a vessel owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed throughout a five-year cycle. 
 ​
 Most vessels are also drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. Two such underwater hull examinations are required during the five-year survey cycle. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the ship owner within mutually agreed upon time limits. 
 Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in-class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). The IACS has adopted harmonized Common Structural Rules, which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers constructed on or after July 1, 2015. The IACS rules attempt to create a level of consistency

 between IACS members. All of the vessels in our fleet are certified as being “in-class” by the American Bureau of Shipping or the Korean Register of Shipping. All new and secondhand vessels that we purchase must be certified prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memoranda of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the scheduled date of closing, we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel. 
 If any vessel does not maintain its class and/or fails any annual survey, intermediate survey, drydocking or special survey, the vessel will be unable to carry cargo between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable which could cause us to be in violation of certain covenants in our loan agreements. Any such inability to carry cargo or be employed, or any such violation of covenants, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition to the classification inspections, many of our customers regularly inspect our vessels as a precondition to chartering them for voyages. We believe that our product and crude tankers are well-maintained, high-quality vessels and that this provides us with a competitive advantage in the current environment of increasing regulation and customer emphasis on quality. 
 Efficiency Trends in the Shipping Industry
Market volatility and higher fuel prices, coupled with increased regulation and concern about the environmental impact of the international shipping industry, have led to an increased focus on fuel efficiency. Many companies have achieved significant efficiency gains through a process called “slow steaming.” These gains are realized by running vessels at substantially less than maximum speed and result in lower fuel costs. 
 Shipbuilders and operators have also studied a number of potential design innovations to increase the efficiency of tanker vessels. Many shipbuilders have incorporated some of these changes into their designs and are marketing these ships as “eco-ships.” Alternatively, some operators, have implemented vessel modification programs for their existing ships in an attempt to capture potential efficiency gains. We will consider making modifications to our current fleet that we believe would make our existing vessels more fuel efficient and competitive as compared with newer vessels being delivered currently. We believe that we can effect these modifications without compromising our fleet’s ability to operate at higher speeds, which is an important factor in generating additional revenue in an improving freight rate environment. With respect to vessels in our current fleet that are employed under time charters, we will consider installing any new technologies when the vessels either trade in the spot market or are re-contracted. 
 Risk of Loss and Liability Insurance
General
The operation of any cargo vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, human error, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, piracy attacks and acts of God. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. OPA, which in certain circumstances imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of any vessel trading in the United States exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for vessel owners and operators trading in the U.S. market. While we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured against, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. 
 Marine and War Risks Insurance
We have in force marine and war risks insurance for all of our vessels. Our marine hull and machinery insurance covers risks of particular average and actual or constructive total loss from collision, fire, grounding, engine breakdown and other insured named perils up to an agreed amount per vessel. Our war risks insurance covers the risks of particular average and actual or constructive total loss from confiscation, 

 
 35


  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 seizure, capture, vandalism, malicious acts, terrorism, acts of piracy, sabotage and other war-related named perils. We have also arranged coverage for increased value for each vessel. Under this increased value coverage, in the event of total loss of a vessel, we will be able to recover amounts in excess of those recoverable under the hull and machinery policy in order to compensate for additional costs associated with replacement of the loss of the vessel. Each vessel is covered up to at least its fair market value at the time of the insurance attachment and subject to a fixed deductible per each single accident or occurrence, but excluding actual or constructive total loss. 
 Protection and Indemnity Insurance
Protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”) and covers the Company’s third-party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from injury, illness or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, loss of or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances, and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal subject to agreed deductibles per any one accident or occurrence. Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, extended by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or “clubs.” 
 As a member of P&I Associations that are, in turn, members of the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “International Group”), we carry protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution with a standalone limit of $1 billion per vessel per incident. The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s ocean-going tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. Although the P&I Associations compete with each other for business, they have found it beneficial to pool their larger risks under the auspices of the International Group. This pooling is regulated by a contractual agreement which defines the risks that are to be pooled and exactly how these risks are to be shared by the participating P&I Associations. We are subject to calls payable to the associations of which we are a member based on its claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. Our vessels may be subject to supplemental calls which are based on estimates of premium income and anticipated and paid claims. Such estimates are adjusted each year by the board of directors of the P&I Association until the closing of the relevant policy year, which generally occurs within three years from the end of the policy year. Supplemental calls, if any, are expensed when they are announced and according to the period they relate to.
