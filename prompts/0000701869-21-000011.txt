ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Independence Holding Company is a Delaware corporation (NYSE: IHC) that was formed in 1980. We are a holding company principally engaged in the health, pet and life insurance business with principal executive offices located at 96 Cummings Point Road, Stamford, Connecticut 06902. IHC and its subsidiaries are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Company", or "IHC", or are implicit in the terms "we", "us" and "our".
 
Our website is located at www.ihcgroup.com. Detailed information about IHC, its corporate affiliates and insurance products and services can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
IHC operates through (i) its insurance carriers: Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York ("Standard Security Life"), Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc. ("Madison National Life") and Independence American Insurance Company and collectively sometimes referred to as the "IHC Carriers", which underwrite specialty health, pet, group life and short-term and long-term disability products and (ii) our Specialty Benefits division comprised of specialty health and pet divisions. We have three continuing business segments: Specialty Health segment, Group disability, life, DBL and PFL segment, and corporate. Our individual life, annuities and other segment is in run-off.
 
The Specialty Health segment is comprised of (i) our traditional distribution through independent agents and national accounts, and (ii) our tech-enabled distribution through our call centers, career advisors, lead generation domains (www.healthinsurance.org, www.medicareresources.org, and www.petplace.com), transactional websites, and our lead generation company, Torchlight Technology Group LLC (“Torchlight”). The pet division is comprised of: PetPartners, Inc. (“PetPartners”), www.akcpetinsurance.com, www.petplace.com, www.mypetinsurance.com and our independent distribution channels. Independence American Insurance Company takes the risk on the pet insurance and many of the specialty health products sold by these divisions, but our agencies also sell life and health products from other insurance companies for which they earn commissions. Our proprietary platforms are designed to support multiple carriers and products, and we are recognized by the industry for our speed to market with innovative new products.

Standard Security Life focuses on underwriting and selling its New York short-term disability (“DBL”) and paid family leave rider (“PFL”) products through general agents primarily to small employers. Madison National Life emphasizes underwriting long-term and short-term disability (“LTD” and “STD”) and group life primarily to school districts and municipalities in the Upper Midwest through managing general agents and independent brokers, and a growing worksite marketing division. Independence American Insurance Company is our primary specialty health and pet underwriter. In 2020, Independence American Insurance Company began underwriting Medicare Supplement in many states. 
 
The insurance agencies owned by IHC (collectively, the “IHC Agencies”) are as follows: IHC Specialty Benefits, Inc. (“IHCSB”), Independence Brokerage Group, Inc. (“IBG”), My1HR, Inc. (“My1HR”), and a majority interest in PetPartners. IHCSB is our agency that operates through (i) our owned call centers, which currently has 65 licensed employee sales agents in three locations, (ii) our career advisors, which includes 225 licensed agents operating in 7 regions, and (iii) our direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) transactional websites, www.mypetinsurance.com and www.healthedeals.com. With respect to the 

4

advisors, we typically provide them with leads (which they either “purchase” or “earn” through IHC production), but they are also expected to generate their own leads. IHC has used this distribution model for over ten years, and we expect to significantly enhance this distribution in 2021. With respect to the call centers, one of the offices is dedicated to servicing calls from members of USAA, while the others focus primarily on selling Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage and ancillary IHC products to the senior market utilizing leads generated organically or purchased. 
 
IBG is our agency that distributes through independent producers in the following ways: (i) through our regional sales directors who support non-owned general agents and call centers, (ii) through national account relationships, and (iii) through our 12 sales telebrokerage employees who function as company-owned general agents calling upon independent agents who have a book of business with small employers. My1HR is a technology company that develops quoting and cloud based enrollment platforms for carriers and key distribution partners. My1HR is also a Web Broker which developed and manages INSX Cloud. This platform enables agents to quote and enroll consumers in Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) plans as well as ancillary health products. During the 2020 Open Enrollment Period (November 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020), INSX Cloud was utilized by more than 3,000 independent agents who submitted almost 230,000 enrollments covering approximately 300,000 members, which were predominantly ACA compliant plans and also included specialty health products underwritten by the IHC Carriers as well as other carriers. PetPartners is a distributor and administrator of pet insurance underwritten by Independence American Insurance Company and an unaffiliated insurer. IHC owns a number of web domains and a lead-generation technology company through its subsidiary, IHC Domain Holdings, LLC (“Domain Holdings”). Domain Holdings owns Healthinsurance.org LLC (“HIO”), which is an on-line marketing company that owns www.healthinsurance.org and www.medicareresources.org, which are lead generation sites for Medicare and individual health and life insurance products. Domain Holdings also owns www.petplace.com, which is a lead generation site for pet insurance that directs those interested in purchasing such insurance to www.petpartners.com. Together these sites produce organic leads for IHCSB’s controlled agency force. IHCSB, Domain Holdings and My1HR together provide the backbone of our insure-tech operations by generating leads, enabling sales of products (both through IHC Carriers and highly rated unaffiliated insurers), and enable independent agents to access ACA (and IHC ancillary) policies through a licensed Web Broker.
 
The IHC Agencies and IHC Carriers perform underwriting, risk selection and pricing, policy administration and management for the majority of our specialty health business, which totaled $196.1 million of gross individual and group health premiums in 2020. In addition, the IHC Agencies sell other coverages for multiple insurers, including small group stop-loss, ACA plans and senior products. The IHC Agencies receive commissions and fees for these services and do not bear any of the insurance risk of the companies to which they provide services. While the majority of sales by IHC Carriers have been to individuals and small employers from independent producers, national accounts and affinity relationships, increasingly we have focused on sales from our controlled distribution. In general, companies that provide insurance through user-centric platforms, or create efficiencies in the insurance industry through technological advances, are referred to as “insuretech” companies. As further described in Outlook, we are increasingly focused on expanding our “insuretech” footprint by (i) generating leads through Domain Holdings, (ii) sales through IHCSB’s owned call center, career advisors and transactional sites, and (iii) expansion of the number of agents using INSX Cloud. Within this segment, the IHC Carriers sell the following products: (i) senior market products, including Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage, dental, vision and hospital indemnity (“HIP”), (ii) ancillary benefits in the under-age-65 market, including dental, vision, short-term medical (“STM”), supplemental products including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and HIP; (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) various life insurance and non-insurance Rx and telemedicine services. The segment includes run-off of a limited amount of discontinued major medical coverage and occupational accident from one producer that was sold in 2017. Several third party administrators, including Ebix Health Administration Exchange, Inc. (“EHAE”), perform claims and other administrative functions. IHC owns a 49% equity interest in Ebix Health Exchange Holdings, LLC (“Ebix Health Exchange”), which owns EHAE. 

5

In 2021, the IHC Carriers will retain the vast majority of the risk that they underwrite, and the IHC Agencies will focus on the following lines of business:
 
·
Senior market products, including Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage 
 ·
Pet insurance 
 ·
Multiple specialty health lines 
 ·
Sales of ACA plans primarily through INSX Cloud 
 ·
Sales of stop-loss insurance for self-funded health plans for businesses of 5 to 100 employee lives

Our Philosophy
 
Historically, our business strategy has focused on maximizing underwriting profits through a variety of niche specialty health insurance, pet, and group disability and life products and through distribution channels that enable us to access specialized or underserved markets in which we believe we have a competitive advantage. In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to focus on sale of products underwritten by the IHC Carriers, but we will also focus much of our attention on the growth of our insuretech division. We are now at a point that much of the core infrastructure has been built and we are continuing to scale up the operations. Our focus will be on increasing our pet insurance sales and recruiting experienced advisors and call center agents who are certified to sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and Prescription Drug Plans. We will also continue to enhance our lead generation expertise and capacity, and launch additional transactional websites. We have already begun building retention teams and we believe that these teams, combined with improvements to the consumer experience on our direct-to-consumer domains, will help to improve policy retention and lifetime value. Lastly, as we rapidly expand our data assets, we will introduce artificial intelligence capabilities to our data analytics with the intent to improve both conversion and retention rates.
 
As further described in Outlook, our goal in 2021 and beyond is to maximize the valuation of IHC through growth of our very profitable life and disability lines of business, while investing in the expansion of our “insuretech” capabilities to generate sales of specialty health, pet and Medicare products directly to consumers through our call centers, career advisors and websites. 
 


DISTRIBUTION
------------

Specialty Health 
 
IHC distributes its specialty health products in a variety of ways. We distribute directly to consumers through our call centers, career advisors and www.heathedeals.com. In 2020 the core products sold by these agents were IHC’s STM and HIP plans as well as ACA-compliant offerings. In 2021, we plan 

6

to emphasize the sale of Medicare Advantage plans underwritten by other carriers, and to a lesser extent, Medicare Supplement policies from Independence American Insurance Company and other carriers. Consumers often also purchase ancillary products, including dental, accident, telemedicine and Rx discounts plans, with a core plan. Our career advisors are licensed agents who sell both IHC and non-IHC products. IHC has used this distribution model for over ten years, but we have significantly enhanced this distribution model in 2020 and expect accelerated growth in 2021. Finally, we sell directly to consumers through www.healthedeals.com. In 2020, Independence American Insurance Company began selling its own Medicare Supplement through our call centers, advisors and select distributors of senior products. 
 
IBG distributes through independent producers in the following ways: (i) through our regional sales directors who support non-owned general agents, (ii) through national account relationships such as Anthem, United Health as well as single state Blue Cross organizations and regional health plans, and (iii) through our 12 sales telebrokerage employees who function as company-owned general agents calling upon independent agents who have a book of business (often property & casualty) with small employers. Our employees earn production bonuses for assisting the agent in placing the health sale with IHC carriers or our carrier partners. The lead product for the owned general agency is small group stop-loss underwritten by multiple non-affiliated carriers, although they also sell our individual and group ancillary products. My1HR, through INSX Cloud, was used by over 3,000 agents in 2020 to distribute quote and enroll almost 230,000 ACA and specialty health plans. Regulations allow Health Reimbursement Account (“HRA”) dollars that employers have contributed on a pre-tax basis to be used by employees to purchase STM as well as ACA plans. The My1HR platform, which provides an enrollment tool to employees with little to no effort on the part of the employer, is well-suited for use with HRAs. In addition to health insurance, IHC’s other products are readily available on INSX Cloud for purchase including dental, critical illness and accident plans.
 
Pet Insurance 
 
We distribute pet insurance in three ways: (i) through PetPartners, where IHC distributes, administers and underwrites the risk of two brands, PetPartners and AKC Pet Insurance, but will also delegate sales and marketing to unaffiliated companies or affinity groups, (ii) through three significant pet administrators where IHC only underwrites the risk, and (iii) through leads generated by www.petplace.com. We own 85% of the equity of PetPartners, which is a pet managing general agent that has an exclusive license agreement to use the American Kennel Club (“AKC”) brand, and has a proprietary administrative platform. In 2020, we generated a significant increase in sales through leads generated from the AKC, and have introduced several initiatives that we expect will increase penetration and conversion of this exclusive lead source in 2021 and beyond. In addition, PetPartners is seeking other internally controlled sales channels, including through employer and affinity groups. In 2019, we relaunched www.PetPlace.com, which we acquired in 2016, with significantly improved content curated by a board of veterinarians. Average daily visitors to the site is over 30,000 which will improve lead generation from this domain. At this time, the majority of Independence American Insurance Company’s pet business is distributed by three independent pet insurance administrators: MetLife (formerly PetFirst Healthcare, LLC (“PetFirst”), Pets Best Insurance Services, LLC (“Pets Best”) and FIGO Pet Insurance, LLC (“FIGO”). IHC owns a 4.73% equity stake in FIGO.
 
Except for licensed agents who are employed in IHC's call center, most agents and brokers who produce the Specialty Health business are non-salaried contractors who receive commissions. 
 
Disability and Life Products
 
Our disability and life products are primarily distributed by general agents, agents and brokers. The short-term statutory disability benefit product, including the paid family leave benefits, in New York State is marketed primarily through independent general agents who are paid commissions based upon the amount of premiums produced. Madison National Life's disability and group life products are primarily sold in the Upper Midwest to school districts and municipalities through a managing general agent that 

7

specializes in these target markets. Independence American Insurance Company also reinsured health products serving the needs of expatriates, third-party nationals and high net-worth local nationals, which is now in run out. The Abacus Group LLC (“Abacus”), specializes in worksite marketing of voluntary benefits and is producing life and disability business for Madison National Life.
 

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS UNDERWRITTEN BY IHC CARRIERS
 
Specialty Health Products
 
In 2020, this line of business had the following categories: (i) ancillary benefits, including dental, vision, STM, and supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness and hospital indemnity); (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) non-subscriber occupational accident. Earned premium is expected to increase in 2021 primarily due to: increased sales of pet insurance, new sales of employer sponsored and voluntary health plans and the continued growth of our owned call centers and advisors.
Ancillary Products
 
This category is primarily comprised of dental, vision, STM, and supplemental products (including gap, fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity). These are sold through multiple distribution strategies as described above.
 
IHC sells group and individual dental products in most states. The dental portfolio includes indemnity and PPO plans for employer groups of two or more lives and for individuals. Employer plans are offered on both employer paid and voluntary basis. As part of the distribution of our individual dental products, we also offer vision benefits. Vision plans will offer a flat reimbursement amount for exams and materials. We expect to see a growth in vision sales primarily due to the launch of an individual vision product in the majority of states and new distribution partnerships.
 
IHC sells STM products in the majority of states. STM is designed specifically for people with temporary needs for health coverage. Typically, STM products are written for a defined duration of at least 30 days and less than twelve months although in 20 states we underwrite STM policies that last up to 36 months. STM products with a duration between twelve and 36 months are referred to as Extend STM products. Among the typical purchasers of STM products are people who are in between open enrollment periods or need coverage for a limited duration until their ACA-compliant plan becomes effective, and others who need insurance for a specified period of time. Our STM plans contain many, but not all, of the essential health benefits found in ACA-compliant plans. In addition, our STM plans often have lower deductibles and broader networks than many ACA-compliant policies, and are almost always more affordable for qualified purchasers. IHC’s gross premium decreased in this line of business in 2018 largely as a result of a ruling which limited STM to plans of 90-day duration or less. Effective October 1, 2018, an executive order from the Trump Administration reversed the previous executive order and restored the decision on the duration of STM to the states. Growth in this line of business in 2021 will be dictated in large part by the approach taken by the Biden Administration.
 
The Company markets supplemental products to individuals and families. These lines of business are generally used as either a supplement or in lieu of an ACA-compliant plan. The main driver for growth in this line is that consumers are moving to higher-cost sharing on their individual major medical plans, and are looking for products to help them offset the additional risk of higher deductibles and out of pocket limits. The product lines included in this supplemental grouping are hospital indemnity plans, fixed indemnity limited benefit plans, critical illness and bundled packages of accident medical coverage, critical illness and life insurance. These products, which are available in most states, are available through multiple distribution sources including Company owned direct-to-consumer websites, call center and career agents, general agents and on-line agencies. We anticipate growth in Independence American Insurance Company’s ancillary lines of business in 2021 from customers who purchase higher deductible ACA plans 

8

on the INSX platform who will desire to also purchase supplemental plans to cover gaps in their ACA coverage, and will have more premium dollars to spend since their ACA cost will be reduced.
 
IHC offers gap plans for employer groups, which help employees manage the financial impact of deductibles on their employer-sponsored plans. We expect that this line of business will be flat in 2021 based on a change in distribution strategy, but will still be a significant portion of our employer group premium.
 
Pet Insurance
 
Independence American Insurance Company has products approved to sell in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We use four distinct forms (policies) to achieve diversity of premium targeting channels focused on purebred puppies (through AKC), shelter/rescue/animal welfare markets, direct to consumer, and affiliate partnerships. In 2021, we expect to file a first-of-its-kind group pet policy for the worksite market. We are currently in discussions with insurers that distribute in the worksite market and will begin contracting worksite brokers in advance of the 2022 enrollment season. We believe an advantage in our product design is flexibility allowing for consumers to build plans of coverage tailored to their needs and budget by offering an array of deductible and coinsurance options and the availability of unlimited policy “maximum” levels. In our owned distribution product, we embed alternative, holistic and behavioral coverage benefits, two levels of wellness options (many competitors do not cover wellness and preventative), hereditary and congenital conditions coverage, as well as the option to have veterinary exam fees covered as a benefit (one of the leading pet insurance providers today specifically excludes exam fees). In 2021, we anticipate significant growth in our target channels due to increased consumer awareness of the product category, new distribution partnerships, as well as improved conversion rates through our AKC and lead generation avenues.
 
PetPartners acquired a mobile app in June 2020, TailTrax, which features a host of high-engagement features to help pet parents manage the health and welfare of their pet. The app is being provided at no additional charge to policyholders and allows access to policy self-service including claims submission. The app is also offered on a subscription basis for non-policyholders, featuring 24/7 access to a vet-help line, discounts on pet services and products including prescription medications, and many of valuable tools. 
 
Occupational Accident
 
The occupational accident product provides accidental death, accident disability and accident medical benefits for occupational injuries to employees of companies that have elected to not participate in the Texas Worker’s Compensation system (non-subscribers). This program is marketed through two competing general agents and only focuses on the micro market (under 10 lives). Overall premium levels are expected to remain relatively constant in 2021. 
 
Group Disability, Life, DBL and PFL
 
Group Long-Term and Short-Term Disability
 
Madison National Life develops partnerships with distribution entities to develop targeted niche focused products that result in market dominate insurance solutions in both risk management and product design. Our products are filed to provide considerable flexibility to meet the needs of our partners and the related niches. 
 
Our group life and disability products are offered on both an employer paid and a voluntary basis. They are designed to protect the covered employee’s income when the employee is not able to work due to illness or injury and pay a benefit to the beneficiary(ies) when an employee dies. 

9

Madison National Life is the largest writer of k-12 school districts in 8 Midwestern states. We continue to work with our distribution partner to focus on product differentiation in the niche through product innovation – most recently having launched in 2020 a one of a kind Active Assailant Rider for school districts. We also continue to develop affinity relationships with large health carriers to provide our disability programs.
 
We are expanding our position in the worksite market with new product filings and administration/distribution partners to position us for growth in 2021 and beyond. The product lines included in the worksite offering are fixed indemnity limited benefit plans, critical illness, accident as well as life and disability insurance. These products, which are available in most states, are available through multiple distribution relationships. The Company anticipates moderate growth in 2021 for these products through expansion of its sales through existing and new distribution relationships.
 
New York Short-Term Disability and Paid Family Leave
 
Standard Security Life markets DBL. All companies with more than one employee in New York State are required to provide DBL insurance for their employees. DBL coverage provides temporary cash payments to replace wages lost as a result of disability due to non-occupational injury or illness. The DBL policy provides for (i) payment of 50% of salary to a maximum of $170 per week; (ii) a maximum of 26 weeks in a consecutive 52-week period; and (iii) benefit commencement on the eighth consecutive day of disability. Policies covering fewer than 50 employees have fixed rates approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”). Policies covering 50 or more employees are individually underwritten. 
 
As of January 1, 2018, the DBL policy was amended to include PFL. The PFL benefit allows for parent bonding with a newborn or an adopted child, caring for a seriously ill family members and to help military families during times of need. Beginning January 1, 2018, with incremental changes until 2021, the benefit will be phased in. The maximum benefit (once completely phased in starting January 1, 2021) will be for 12 weeks at 67% of an employees’ weekly wage up to a maximum benefit of $869 per week. The PFL premium rate is set by the NYSDFS. In addition to mandating this benefit, the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program so that all carriers would share on a pro rata basis in the ultimate profit or loss of the PFL business across three group sizes for the entire industry. The goal of the PFL risk adjustment program is to protect issuers from disproportionate adverse or favorable risks that might arise because PFL premium rates are community rated and not allowed to vary by risk factors. 
 
Group Term Life
 
The Company sells group term life products, including group term life (which includes new term to 120 product), accidental death and dismemberment ("AD&D"), supplemental life and supplemental AD&D and dependent life. As with its group disability business, IHC anticipates modest growth in this line of business through expansion of its sales of these group term life products through existing distribution sources. 
Individual Life, Annuities and Other
 
Madison National Life ceased writing individual life and annuity policies in 2015 and the remaining policies in runoff are 100% ceded.
 
The following lines of Standard Security Life's in-force business are in runoff: individual accident and health, individual life (of which a significant portion is 100% ceded), single premium immediate annuities, disability income and miscellaneous insurance business.

ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS SOLD BY IHC AGENCIES
 
Senior Products
 
Medicare Supplement 
 
The IHC Agencies earn commissions and marketing fees from selling Medicare Supplements (also known as Medigap), which is insurance sold by private companies which help pay some of the healthcare costs that Medicare does not cover, including copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. The IHC Agencies sell Medicare Supplements manufactured by Insurance Company and a few carefully selected carriers.Medicare Advantage 
 
The IHC Agencies earn commissions and marketing fees from selling Medicare Advantage (“MA”), which is a type of HMO, PPO or Special Needs Plans sold by private companies, that contract with the federal government through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to cover all Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. Many MA plans also include Medicare Part D (prescription drugs), known as MAPD plans, as well as other supplemental benefits, including dental, eyeglasses, transportation and hearing coverage. The IHC Agencies sell MA plans offered by a select few of the leading carriers in each market. 
Other Products
 
Small Group Self-Funded
 
The IHC Agencies earn commissions and marketing fees from non-IHC carriers for selling employer group and individual insurance products, including self-funded programs for groups of five to 75 employees in 21 states. The self-funded plans are generally less expensive than ACA qualified group health coverage. In addition to earning commission overrides on group health sales the IHC Agencies use our proprietary quoting and enrollment tools to offer IHC ancillary plans along with self-funded plans.
Affordable Care Act Plans
 
The IHC Agencies earn commission overrides by offering ACA plans through 13 ACA carriers in many states. The majority of these customers are enrolled through My1HR, our wholly owned Web Broker, under the INSX Cloud brand. Independent agents can also use INSX Cloud to enroll their customers in ACA plans for which we earn a transaction fee. 

REINSURANCE AND POLICY RETENTIONS
---------------------------------



IHC retained approximately 97% of gross and assumed Specialty Health exposure in both 2020 and 2019. 
 
The Company purchases quota share reinsurance and excess reinsurance in amounts deemed appropriate by its risk committee. The Company monitors its retention amounts by product line, and has the ability to adjust its retention as appropriate.
 
Reinsurance is used to reduce the potentially adverse financial impact of large individual or group risks, and to reduce the strain on statutory income and surplus related to new business. By using reinsurance, the Insurance Group is able to write policies in amounts larger than it could otherwise accept. The amount reinsured is the portion of each policy in excess of the retention limit on a particular policy. 

11


The following reinsurers represent approximately 91% of the total ceded premium for the year ended December 31, 2020:
 

RGA Reinsurance Company | 47%
------------------------------------------+----
National Guardian Life Insurance Company | 31%
Unicare Life and Health Insurance Company | 7% 
Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company | 6% 
 | 91%



The Insurance Group remains liable with respect to the insurance in-force, which has been reinsured in the unlikely event that the assuming reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations. The Insurance Group cedes business (i) to individual reinsurance companies that are rated "A-" or better by Best or (ii) upon provision of adequate security. The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Insurance Group's ceded life insurance in-force was $4.8 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.
 
For information pertaining to reinsurance, reference is made to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
 

INVESTMENTS AND RESERVES
------------------------



The Company's cash, cash equivalents and securities portfolio are managed by employees of IHC and its affiliates, and ultimate investment authority rests with IHC's in-house investment group. As a result of the nature of IHC's insurance liabilities, IHC endeavors to maintain a significant percentage of its assets in investment grade securities, cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2020, 99.5% of the Company’s fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA. The internal investment group provides a summary of the investment portfolio and the performance thereof at the meetings of the Company's board of directors.
 
As required by insurance laws and regulations, the Insurance Group establishes reserves to meet obligations on policies in-force. These reserves are amounts that, with additions from premiums expected to be received and with interest on such reserves at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet anticipated future policy obligations. Premiums and reserves are based upon certain assumptions with respect to mortality, morbidity on health insurance, lapses and interest rates effective at the time the polices are issued. The Insurance Group also establishes appropriate reserves for substandard business, annuities and additional policy benefits, such as waiver of premium and accidental death. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life are also required by law to have an annual asset adequacy analysis, which, in general, projects the amount and timing of cash flows to the estimated maturity date of liabilities, prepared by the certifying actuary for each insurance company. The Insurance Group invests their respective assets, which support the reserves and other funds in accordance with applicable insurance law, under the supervision of their respective board of directors. The Company manages interest rate risk seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. The Company occasionally utilizes options to modify the duration and average life of the assets. 
 
Under Wisconsin insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. With respect to the portion of an insurer's assets equal to its liabilities plus a statutorily-determined security surplus amount, a Wisconsin insurer cannot, for example, invest more than a certain percentage of its assets in non-amortizable evidences of indebtedness, securities of any issuer and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary and the United States government), or common stock of any corporation and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary or mutual funds).

12

Under New York insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. For example, a New York life insurer cannot invest more than a certain percentage of its admitted assets in common or preferred shares of any one institution, obligations secured by any one property (other than those issued, guaranteed or insured by the United States or any state government or agency thereof), or medium and lower grade obligations. In addition, there are certain qualitative investment restrictions.  
 
Under Delaware insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. In addition, there are qualitative investment restrictions.
 
The Company's total pre-tax investment performance for each of the last two years is summarized below, including amounts recognized in net income and unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income or loss (in thousands): 
 

 | | 2020 | | 2019 
--------------------------------------------------+---+--------+---+-------
Consolidated Statements of Income: | | | | 
Net investment income | $ | 11,777 | $ | 15,643
Net investment gains | | 1,346 | | 4,705 
Other-than-temporary impairments | | - | | (646) 
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income: | | | | 
Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities | | 3,793 | | 12,070
Total pre-tax investment performance | $ | 16,916 | $ | 31,772

 
Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities recognized through other comprehensive income (loss) represents the pre-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities arising during the year net of reclassification adjustments and includes the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2020.
 

COMPETITION AND REGULATION
--------------------------



We compete with many large mutual and stock insurance companies, small regional health insurers and managed care organizations. Mutual companies may have certain competitive advantages since profits inure directly to the benefit of the policyholders. 
 
The health insurance industry tends to be cyclical. During a “soft” market cycle, a larger number of companies offer insurance on a certain line of business, which causes premiums in that line to trend downward. In a “hard” market cycle, insurance companies limit their writings in certain lines of business following periods of excessive losses and insurance and reinsurance companies redeploy their capital to lines that they believe will achieve higher margins. 
 
IHC is an insurance holding company; and as such, IHC and its subsidiary carriers and administrative companies are subject to regulation and supervision by multiple state insurance regulators, including the NYSDFS (Standard Security Life's domestic regulator), the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (Madison National Life's domestic regulator) and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (Independence American Insurance Company’s domestic regulator). Each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American Insurance Company is subject to regulation and supervision in every state in which it is licensed to transact business. These supervisory agencies have broad administrative powers with respect to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business, the licensing of agents, the approval of policy forms, the approval of commission rates, the form and content of mandatory financial statements, reserve requirements and the

types and maximum amounts of investments which may be made. Such regulation is primarily designed for the benefit of policyholders rather than the stockholders of an insurance company or insurance holding company.
 
Certain transactions within the IHC holding company system are also subject to regulation and supervision by such regulatory agencies. All such transactions must be fair and equitable. Notice to or prior approval by the applicable insurance department is required with respect to transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions, including dividend declarations, between an insurer and any person in its holding company system. Under New York, Wisconsin and Delaware insurance laws, "control" is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person. Under New York law, control is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds, with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In Wisconsin, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote more than ten percent of the voting securities of another person. In Delaware, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In all three states, the acquisition of control of a domestic insurer needs to be approved in advance by the Commissioner of Insurance. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for information as to restrictions on the ability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.
 
Risk-based capital requirements are imposed on life, accident and health and property and casualty insurance companies. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by dividing an insurance company's total adjusted capital, as defined, by its authorized control level risk-based capital. Companies that do not meet certain minimum standards require specified corrective action. The risk-based capital ratios for each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American Insurance Company exceed such minimum ratios.
