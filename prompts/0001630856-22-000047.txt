Item 1. Business
General
Professional Holding Corp., a Florida corporation ("PFHD", together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") is the bank holding company for Professional Bank, a Florida banking corporation (the "Bank"). The Company is registered as a financial holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Holding Company Act") and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"). We were incorporated in 2014 and are headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. We operate primarily through our wholly owned subsidiary, Professional Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank, which commenced operations in 2008. We focus on providing creative, relationship-driven commercial banking products and services designed to meet the needs of our clients. Our clients are small to medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of these businesses, and other professionals and entrepreneurs. We conduct our banking operations from eleven branch locations in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach also known as Miami-Dade metropolitan statistical area, or MSA, which encompasses three rapidly growing counties in Florida: Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. Not including investment banks and savings and loan associations, we are the twelfth largest independent community bank in Florida. Additionally, we have a Digital Innovation Center located in Cleveland, Ohio, Loan Production Offices in St. Pete, FL and Jacksonville, and a Loan Production Office in Bedford, NH that specializes in search fund lending.
Our Digital Innovation Center in Cleveland supports our investments in digital and technology. We have successfully recruited technology professionals from national banking institutions and global consulting firms with experience in transformational digital experiences and capabilities. We believe that our technology platform allows us to compete with larger financial institutions by offering our clients a cutting-edge digital experience that can be specifically tailored to multiple demographics, while also continuing the customized concierge service that our clients have come to expect. For example, this team has successfully deployed competitively differentiated digital assets such as robotic process automation bots which drive operational efficiency, our online account opening service, and premium contactless debit card. We anticipate that as we innovate other financial institutions may be interested in purchasing a range of these banker tools including our digital account opening platform.
Appointment of New Chairman, Chief Executive, and Chief Financial Officer
On February 24, 2022, following the resignation of Daniel R. Sheehan by mutual agreement, Herbert Martens, a founder and original director of the Bank, was elected non-executive Chairman of the Board of both the the Company and the Bank. Mr. Martens has more than 30 years of banking and investment experience, most recently serving as Executive Vice President of National City Corporation and National City Bank, until 2006. Mr. Martens is currently Managing Partner of Advent Associates, LLC, a private investment company. Mr. Martens is a Class III director of the Company. Also, on February 24, Abel Iglesias was elected Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Bank where he has served in multiple leadership capacities over the last nine years including his most recent role as President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Iglesias has over 30 years of banking experience in South Florida and is currently serving his second three-year term on the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In addition to his new role as CEO of both the Company and the Bank, Mr. Iglesias will be be President of both entities. Mr. Iglesias is a Class II director of the Company. On March 31, 2022, Mary Usategui was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company. She will continue in her role as Chief Financial Officer of the Bank. These individuals have been instrumental in the growth of PFHD, and have demonstrated a commitment to community, clients, stakeholders, and employees alike.
Market and Economic Overview
Our primary markets are in Florida and are characterized by a rapidly growing population, a high level of job growth, an affordable cost of living, and a pro-growth business climate that is among the most vibrant in the United States. Florida's economy continues to expand despite the COVID-19 pandemic. For the twelve months ended November 2021, Florida’s private sector jobs grew by 6.4%, which exceeded national private sector job growth by 2.0%. Our main concentration is in the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), which is one of the top MSAs in the Southeast as measured by both deposits and population and is one of the largest business markets in Florida. We also operate full-service branches in Broward and Palm Beach counties and LPOs headquartered in Hillsborough and Duval counties. The Company’s management remains encouraged by the resiliency of the current economic environment in our markets and the prospects for continued growth of the Company.
Strategic Outlook
We believe that we have developed a reputation in our market for highly customized services, and we continue to seek new ways to meet our clients’ financial needs. We offer a full line of deposit products, cash management services and commercial and residential loan programs, as well as online/digital and mobile banking capabilities. We firmly believe our clients place value on our local and timely decision-making, coupled with the high-quality service that we provide. Approaching our clients’ challenges from a different point of view is at the heart of our culture, as our bankers are extremely familiar with our clients’ businesses, enabling us to more accurately assess risk than competitors, while developing mutually acceptable credit structures for the Bank and its clients.
We believe our investments in people, our platform and technology, as well as our ongoing efforts to attract talented banking professionals, gives us the potential for future growth and enhanced profitability. We have invested in hiring additional team members who are working so that we can own more of our digital experience with the intent of providing our clients new, unique, and satisfying offerings. Our focus, culture, brand, and reputation throughout our market enhance our ability to continue to grow organically, successfully recruit talented bankers and pursue opportunistic acquisitions in the future.
Our goal is to continue our growth to service increasingly larger and sophisticated clients, while remaining agile enough to be a leading speed-based competitor in acquiring new clients. In an effort to keep our operating costs low while continuing to seek opportunities for growth, we have typically established new banking teams in lower cost loan production offices before committing to opening a more expensive full-service branch. By establishing banking teams in lower cost loan production offices, we can avoid long-term lease commitments, costly branch improvements and related costs until our new banking team has attracted a sufficient number of banking relationships and earning assets. Once the newly hired team achieves a certain financial scale, we evaluate the economics of opening a full-service branch. This strategy has allowed us to achieve significant growth while prudently managing our expansion costs and maintaining our strong credit quality.

We believe both culture and brand are at the core of our messaging when attracting and retaining both bankers and clients. We believe continued consolidation throughout Florida will provide us with additional opportunities to grow in both our current footprint and move into other Florida metropolitan areas where we don't yet have a presence. To capitalize on these opportunities, we intend to (i) continue to evaluate lift-outs of high-performing banking teams, (ii) leverage the relationships and contacts of our existing bankers to identify and target suitable business and individual clients, and (iii) develop comprehensive banking relationships with these businesses and individuals by delivering competitive banking products and services comparable to that of larger institutions while providing the superior client service expected of a smaller community bank.
We are subject to state and federal banking laws and regulations that govern virtually all aspects of our operations. Any changes in applicable laws, regulations or the enforcement thereof may materially affect our business and prospects. Proposed legislative or regulatory changes may also affect our operations. The following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject. References to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries, do not purport to be 
complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. The Company and the Bank are Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employers.
Supervision and Regulation
Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected, not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include, but are not limited to, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of those goals, the U.S. Congress and the individual states have created numerous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, that govern banks and the banking industry. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance funds, our depositors and the public, rather than the stockholders and creditors.
The Company and its subsidiary bank are required to file annual and quarterly reports with various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The Federal Reserve and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge for the cost of such an examination. The Company is also subject to reporting and disclosure requirements under state and federal securities laws.
New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which any of our businesses may be affected by any new regulation or statute.
The following is an attempt to summarize some of the relevant laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing banks. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed.
Holding Company Regulation
We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, or BHC Act. As a result, we are subject to supervisory regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the BHC Act, and other federal laws subject financial holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
Permitted Activities
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act modernized the United States banking system by: (i) allowing bank holding companies that qualify as “financial holding companies,” such as Professional Holding Corp., to engage in a broad range of financial and related activities; (ii) allowing insurers and other financial service companies to acquire banks; (iii) removing restrictions that applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv) establishing the overall regulatory scheme applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. Activities that are financial in nature are broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance, and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities, or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. To maintain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all subsidiary depository institutions must be well managed and “well capitalized.” Additionally, all subsidiary depository institutions must have received at least a “Satisfactory” rating on their most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination. Failure to meet these requirements may result in limitations on activities and acquisitions.
Safe and Sound Banking Practices
Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or that constitute a violation of law or regulations. Additionally, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act codification of the Federal Reserve’s long-standing policy, bank holding companies must serve as a source of financial strength 
for their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support Professional Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. 
The Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudence, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of distributions to stockholders unless its available net income has been sufficient to fully fund the distributions and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with a bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on the making of distributions as a result of the requirement that our subsidiary bank maintains an adequate level of capital as described below. Limitations on our subsidiary bank paying dividends could, in turn, affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies, including the authority to impose interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to file written notice and obtain its approval prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities unless certain conditions are met.
Capital Regulations
The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on financial holding companies and state member banks, such as Professional Bank. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact enhanced capital and liquidity rules. The Federal Reserve may also set higher captial requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The Company seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to meet these regulatory guidelines and to support our business activities. The Company's regulatory capital ratios and those of its subsidiary bank are in excess or the levels established for "well-capitalized" institutions under the rules. An institution is subject to limitations on certain activities including the payment of dividends, share repurchases, and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital falls below certain levels. Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, we are generally able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to us. We are also able to raise capital for contributions to the Bank by issuing securities, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws.
Changes in Control
Subject to certain exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (“CBCA”), together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any acquisition of “control” of a bank or bank holding company. Under the BHC Act, a company (a broadly defined term that includes partnerships among other things) that acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution is deemed to control the institution and to be a bank holding company. A company that acquires less than 5% of any class of voting security (and that does not exhibit the other control factors) is presumed not to have control. For ownership levels between the 5% and 25% thresholds, the Federal Reserve has adopted a rule that outlines circumstances in which control may or may not exist.
Under the CBCA, if an individual or a company that acquires 10% or more of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution or its holding company and either that institution or company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition, then that investor is presumed to have control and may be required to file a change in bank control notice with the institution’s or the holding company’s primary federal regulator. Our Class A Common Stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
As a financial holding company, we are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless we own a majority of such bank’s voting shares), or (iii) acquiring, merging or consolidating with any other bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the companies records of addressing the credit needs of the communities they serve, including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
Under Florida law, a person or entity proposing to directly or indirectly acquire control of a Florida bank must also obtain permission from the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. Florida statutes define “control” as either (i) indirectly or directly 
owning, controlling or having power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of a bank; (ii) controlling the election of a majority of directors of a bank; (iii) owning, controlling, or having power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities as well as directly or indirectly exercising a controlling influence over management or policies of a bank; or (iv) as determined by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. These requirements will affect us because the Bank is chartered under Florida law and changes in control of the Company are indirect changes in control of the Bank.
Tying
Financial holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extending credit, to other services or products offered by the holding company or its affiliates, such as deposit products.
Bank Regulation
Professional Bank is a state-chartered commercial banking institution that is chartered by and headquartered in the State of Florida and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The Florida Office of Financial Regulation supervises and regulates all areas of our operations including, without limitation, the making of loans, the issuance of securities, the conduct of our corporate affairs, the satisfaction of capital adequacy requirements, the payment of dividends, and the establishment or closing of banking centers. We are also a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, which makes our operations subject to broad federal regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve. In addition, our deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain supervisory and enforcement powers over us.
As a state-chartered bank in the State of Florida, we are empowered by statute, subject to the limitations contained in those statutes, to take and pay interest on, savings and time deposits, to accept demand deposits, to make loans on residential and other real estate, to make consumer and commercial loans, to invest, with certain limitations, in equity securities and in debt obligations of banks and corporations and to provide various other banking services for the benefit of our clients. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect our operations, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit and equal credit opportunity laws, and fair credit reporting. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, prohibits insured state-chartered institutions from conducting activities that are not permitted for national banks. A bank, however, may engage in an otherwise prohibited activity if it meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”).
As part of FDICIA’s efforts to promote the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, appropriate federal banking regulators are required to have in place regulations specifying operational and management standards (addressing internal controls, loan documentation, credit underwriting and interest rate risk), asset quality and earnings. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have extensive authority to police unsafe or unsound practices and violations of applicable laws and regulations by depository institutions and their holding companies.
The ability of Professional Bank, as a Florida state-chartered bank, to pay dividends is restricted under the Florida law as well as the rules and requirements of the Federal Reserve. As discussed above, Professional Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain an adequate level of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by the federal regulators.
Capital Adequacy
In addition to the capital rules applicable to both banks and bank holding companies discussed above, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the federal bank regulators are required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, banking regulators must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized.” The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. An institution that is categorized as “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject our subsidiary bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits and other restrictions on our business.
Deposit Insurance
The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor, through the DIF and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. 
The FDIC’s deposit insurance premium assessment is based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative limits on transactions between a bank and any affiliate and requires certain levels of collateral for such loans. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that certain transactions between the Company’s subsidiary bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act and its corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. These regulations provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its market area. Federal banking agencies are required to publicly disclose each bank’s rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal Reserve considers a bank’s Community Reinvestment Act rating when the bank submits an application to establish bank branches, merge with another bank, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a financial holding company, the Community Reinvestment Act performance record of all banks involved in a merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with another bank or bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block a transaction. We received a "satisfactory" rating on our most recent Community Reinvestment Act evaluation by the Federal Reserve.
Anti-Money Laundering
The USA PATRIOT Act provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act puts in place measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions.
The USA PATRIOT Act and the related Federal Reserve regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:
•internal policies, procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the savings association’s compliance with all the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA and related laws and regulations;
•systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities; a designated compliance officer;
•employee training;
•an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;
•procedures to verify the identity of each client upon the opening of accounts; and
•heightened due diligence policies, procedures, and controls applicable to certain foreign and high risk accounts and relationships.
Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP, as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the identity 
and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time. Furthermore, all customers must be screened against SDN-Special Designated National and Blocked Persons List among any other related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. On May 11, 2018, the United States Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule under the BSA requiring banks to identify and verify the identity of the natural persons behind their customers that are legal entities — the beneficial owners. We and our affiliates have adopted policies, procedures and controls designed to comply with the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act.
Moreover, South Florida has been designated as a “High Intensity Financial Crime Area,” or HIFCA, by FinCEN and a “High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area,” or HIDTA, by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The HIFCA program is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering efforts in higher-risk areas. The HIDTA designation makes it possible for local agencies to benefit from ongoing HIDTA-coordinated program initiatives that are working to reduce drug use. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
The Bank is also subject to other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients when taking deposits or making loans to such clients. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing client relations.
In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer businesses. These include regulations setting “ability to repay” standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for loans that meet the requirements of the “qualified mortgage” safe harbor. In addition, on October 3, 2015, the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications. The TRID rules were further amended in 2017.
The Cornavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act")
The CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and to stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to the business of banking including: (i) allowing banks not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a troubled debt restructuring (ii) allowing banks to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes, (iii) temporarily reducing the community bank leverage ratio alternative available to institutions of less than $10 billion of assets to 8%, (iv) permitted certain mortgage borrowers experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic, to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance could be granted for up to 180 days, subject to extensions upon the request of the borrower up to a total of 18 months. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract could accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally-backed mortgage was prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action. Additional opportunities for forbearance were subsequently made available by the federal agencies and, most recently, certain forbearance options were extended indefinitely through the end of the COVID-19 National Emergency, and (v) permitted certain multi-family federally backed mortgage borrowers who were current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance could be granted for up to 30 days, which could be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. Later extensions were made available, for a total of six months, for certain federally backed multi-family mortgage loans. During the time of the forbearance, the multi-family borrower could not evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multi-family borrower that received a forbearance could not 
require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provided the tenant notice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance. Most recently, certain forbearance options for borrowers of federally-backed multi-family mortgages were extended indefinitely by federal agencies due to the uncertain nature of the pandemic.
The Paycheck Protection Program 
The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $659 billion to fund loans by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100% federally guaranteed (principal and interest). An eligible business could apply under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly “payroll costs” limited to a loan amount of $10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over $100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2021) to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrower’s lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2021 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be fully reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021, though existing borrowers may still be eligible for loan forgiveness. As of December 31, 2021, we had 356 active PPP loans remaining totaling $58.6 million, net of unearned income.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies.
We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (which will be on June 30, 2025) or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These include an attestation of our internal controls, as required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and scaled disclosures in our MD&A and Selected Financial Data which exclude periods prior to the earliest period presented in our initial registration statements. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, while we are an emerging growth company we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
