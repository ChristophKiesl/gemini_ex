ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business
 
Structure
 
Lightstone REIT II is a Maryland corporation, formed on April 28, 2008, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2009.
 
Lightstone REIT II is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LP (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership formed on April 30, 2008. As of December 31, 2020, we held a 99% general partnership interest in our Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
Lightstone REIT II and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to Lightstone REIT II, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
We have and will continue to seek to acquire a diverse portfolio of real estate assets and real estate-related investments, including hotels, other commercial and/or residential properties, primarily located in the United States. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. We may also originate or acquire mortgage loans secured by real estate. Although we expect that most of our investments will be of these types, we may invest in whatever types of real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests.
 
We currently have one operating segment. As of December 31, 2020, we (i) majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 14 limited service hotels containing a total of 1,802 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated 48.6% membership interest in Brownmill, LLC (“Brownmill”), an affiliated entity that owns two retail properties, and (iii) held an unconsolidated 50.0% membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”), an affiliated entity that owns and operates a 183-room limited service hotel located in Long Island City, New York (the “Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City”). We account for our unconsolidated membership interests in Brownmill and the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting.
 
As of December 31, 2020, seven of our consolidated limited service hotels are held in a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) formed between us and Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (“Lightstone I”), a related party REIT also sponsored by The Lightstone Group, LLC. We and Lightstone I have 97.5% and 2.5% membership interests in the Joint Venture, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, certain of our consolidated hotels also have ownership interests held by unrelated minority owners. The membership interests of Lightstone I and the unrelated minority owners are accounted for as noncontrolling interests.

Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On May 20, 2008, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. Our Advisor also owns 20,000 shares of common stock (“Common Shares”) which were issued on May 20, 2008 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of The Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as the sponsor (the ’’Sponsor’’) during our initial public offering and follow-on offering (the “Follow-On Offering”, and collectively, the “Offerings”), which terminated on August 15, 2012 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Our Advisor, pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, together with our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), is primarily responsible for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Associate General Partner”), which owns 177.0 subordinated profits interests (“Subordinated Profits Interests”) in the Operating Partnership which were acquired for aggregate consideration of $17.7 million in connection with our Offerings. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT II or the Operating Partnership.
 
We do not have any employees. The Advisor receives compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets.
 
Our Advisor has affiliates which may manage certain of the properties we acquire. However, we also contract with other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties.
 
Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our Common Shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading. In the event we do not obtain listing prior to September 27, 2024, which is the tenth anniversary of the termination of our Follow-On Offering, our charter requires that our Board of Directors must either (i) seek stockholder approval of an extension or amendment of this listing deadline; or (ii) seek stockholder approval to adopt a plan of liquidation of the corporation.
 
Noncontrolling Interests – Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
Limited Partner 
 
On May 20, 2008, our Advisor contributed $2,000 to our Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner common units in our Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert limited partner common units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our Common Shares.
Associate General Partner
 
In connection with our Offerings, which concluded on September 27, 2014, the Associate General Partner contributed (i) cash of approximately $12.9 million and (ii) equity interests totaling 48.6% in Brownmill, which were valued at $4.8 million, to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 177.0 Subordinated Profits Interests in the Operating Partnership with an aggregate value of $17.7 million.
 As the majority owner of the Associate General Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99% interest in such Subordinated Profits Interests and thus receives an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof.
 
These Subordinated Profits Interests may entitle the Associate General Partner to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. There were no distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, total distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests were $1.2 million. Since our inception through December 31, 2020, the cumulative distributions declared and paid on the Subordinated Profits Interests were $7.9 million. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Profits Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return, as described above.
 
Other Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries
 
Other noncontrolling interests consist of the (i) membership interest in the Joint Venture held by Lightstone I and (ii) membership interests held by minority owners in certain of our hotels.
Operations - Operating Partnership Activity
 
Our Operating Partnership commenced its operations on October 1, 2009. Since then, we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to a lesser extent, acquire and operate other commercial properties (such as retail and industrial) and residential properties, and make real estate-related investments, principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our holdings currently consist of hospitality properties and retail properties (multi-tenanted shopping centers). All of our properties have been and will continue to be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with others.

Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates, and Lightstone SLP II, LLC are related parties of the Company. Certain of these entities are entitled to compensation for services related to the investment, management and disposition of our assets during our acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our acquisition and operational stages are based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements.
Primary Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk.
 
Acquisition and Investment Policies 
 
We have and/or intend to continue to acquire commercial (including full-service or select service hotels and retail properties) and residential real estate assets, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Unlike other REITs, which typically specialize in one sector of the real estate market, we invest and may continue to invest in both residential and commercial properties as well as other real estate-related investments to create a diverse portfolio of property types and take advantage of our Sponsor’s expertise in acquiring larger properties and portfolios of both residential and commercial properties. We generally intend to hold each acquired property for a period of seven to ten years although we may hold our properties for differing timelines depending on various factors.
 
We are not limited in the number, size or geographical location of any real estate assets. The number and mix of assets we acquire depends, in part, upon real estate and market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we acquire our assets. We may expand our focus to include properties located outside the United States. If we invest in properties outside of the United States, we intend to focus on properties which we believe to have similar characteristics as those properties in which we have previous investment and management expertise. We do not anticipate that these international investments would comprise more than 10% of our portfolio. Investment in areas outside of the United States may be subject to risks different than those impacting properties in the United States.
 
We have made and/or may make the following types of real estate investments:
 

● | Fee interests in market-rate, multifamily properties located either in or near major metropolitan areas. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with job growth opportunities and demand demographics which support potential long-term value appreciation for multifamily properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fee interests in power shopping centers and malls located in highly trafficked retail corridors, in selected high-barrier to entry markets and sub-markets. “Power” shopping centers are large retail complexes that are generally unenclosed and located in suburban areas that typically contain one or more large brand name retailers rather than a department store anchor tenant. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with constraints on the amount of additional property supply, which will make future competition less likely. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fee interests in improved, multi-tenanted, industrial properties and properties that contain industrial and office space (“industrial flex”) located near major transportation arteries and distribution corridors with limited management responsibilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fee interests in improved, multi-tenanted, office properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fee interests in lodging properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preferred equity interests in entities that own the property types listed above. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mezzanine loans secured by the pledges of equity interests in entities that own the property types listed above. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercial mortgage-backed securities secured by mortgages on real property. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collateralized debt obligations. 
--+-------------------------------------


● | Investments in equity securities issued by public or private real estate companies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, we may diversify our portfolio by investing up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly. We may also acquire majority or minority interests in other entities (or business units of such entities) with investment objectives similar to ours or with management, investment or development capabilities that our Board of Directors deems desirable or advantageous to acquire. 
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
We have and intend to continue to utilize leverage to make our investments. The number of different investments we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us, we may purchase certain investments for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. There is no limitation on the amount we may invest in any single investment or on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any investment.
 
Our charter restricts the aggregate amount we may borrow, both secured and unsecured, to 300% of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to the stockholders. In addition, our charter limits our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings (having a maturity greater than two years) to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all investments unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders. Our charter also prohibits us from making or investing in mortgage loans, including construction loans, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including our loans, would exceed 85% of the property’s appraised value.
 
We may finance our investment acquisitions through a variety of means, including but not limited to single property mortgages, as well as, mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of property and through exchange of an interest in the property for limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to finance our investments with debt which will be on a non-recourse basis. However, we may, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders, if we believe this may result in more favorable terms.
 
Distributions on Common Shares
 
Objectives
 
U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.
 
We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. “Return of capital” refers to distributions to investors in excess of net income. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders’ aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for depreciation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax-deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Our Board of Directors commenced declaring and we began paying regular quarterly distributions on our Common Shares at the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.65 per share, or an annualized rate of 6.5% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2015. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly distributions on our Common Shares to the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share, or an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. Additionally, in February 2017 our Board of Directors declared, and in March 2017 we paid a special “catch-up” distribution on our Common Shares at an annualized rate of 0.5% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share for all the quarterly periods beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009 and ending with the third quarter of 2015.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, distributions on our Common Shares were declared quarterly, for each calendar quarter end, at the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share, or an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share, to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end. All distributions were paid on or about the 15th day of the month following the quarter-end.
 
On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly distributions.

There were no distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2020. Total distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $12.3 million.
 
Future distributions declared, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. The Board of Directors will consider various factors in its determination, including but not limited to, the sources and availability of capital, revenues and other sources of income, operating and interest expenses and our ability to refinance near-term debt as well as the IRS’s annual distribution requirement that REITs distribute no less than 90% of their taxable income. We cannot assure that any future distributions will be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have previously established or may establish.
 
Distributions on Subordinated Profits Interests
 
There were no distributions paid on the Subordinated Profit Interests through December 31, 2016. However, in connection with the Board of Directors declaration of a special distribution on our Common Shares on February 28, 2017, they also declared that distributions be brought current through December 31, 2016 on the Subordinated Profits Interests at a 7% annualized rate of return which amounted to approximately $4.2 million and were paid to Lightstone SLP II, LLC on March 15, 2017. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, our Board of Directors declared, and we paid regular quarterly distributions on the Subordinated Profits Interests at an annualized rate of 7.0% along with the regular quarterly distributions on our Common Shares for all quarterly periods through December 31, 2019.
 
These Subordinated Profits Interests may entitle the Associate General Partner to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that the Company makes to its stockholders, but only after its stockholders have received a stated preferred return. There were no distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, total distributions declared on the Subordinated Profits Interests were $1.2 million. Since the Company’s inception through December 31, 2020, the cumulative distributions declared and paid on the Subordinated Profits Interests were $7.9 million. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Profits Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return, as described above.
 
Share Repurchase Programs 
 
Our share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) may provide eligible stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell Common Shares back to us, subject to restrictions and applicable law. A selling stockholder must be unaffiliated with us, and must have beneficially held the Common Shares for at least one year prior to offering the Common Shares for sale to us through the Share Repurchase Program. Subject to certain limitations, we will also redeem Common Shares upon the request of the estate, heir or beneficiary of a deceased stockholder.
 
On December 13, 2018, our Board of Directors changed the price for all purchases under our Share Repurchase Program to 100% of the estimated net asset value per share of the Company’s common stock, which is $8.02 per share as of December 31, 2020.
 
Redemption of shares, when requested, will be made on a quarterly basis subject to our Board of Director’s approval. Provided sufficient funds are available, the number of shares repurchased during the current calendar year will not exceed two percent of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. Funding for the Share Repurchase Program will come exclusively from operating funds, if any, as the Board of Directors, at its sole discretion, may reserve for this purpose. 
 
For the period from January 1 through March 18, 2020, we redeemed 0.1 million common shares at an average price of $10.00 per share. During 2019, we redeemed 0.4 million common shares at an average price per share of $10.00 per share.
 
On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension of all redemptions effective immediately.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2009. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), including when we acquire a hotel we usually establish a TRS which then enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any. 
 
COVID-19 Pandemic Operations and Liquidity Update
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic leading many countries, including the United States, particularly at the individual state level, to subsequently impose various degrees of restrictions and other measures, including, but not limited to, mandatory temporary closures, quarantine guidelines, limitations on travel, and “shelter in place” rules in an effort to reduce its duration and the severity of its spread. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, most of these previously imposed restrictions and other measures have now been reduced and/or lifted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic and its duration and extent is likely dependent on numerous developments such as the regulatory approval, mass production, administration and ultimate effectiveness of vaccines, as well as the timeline to achieve a level of sufficient herd immunity amongst the general population. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the overall health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable future.

The extent to which our business may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, room demand for our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels began to significantly decline in March 2020 and while there has been some slight improvement; room demand continues to be substantially below historical levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results to date and we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot currently estimate if and when room demand will fully recover to pre-pandemic levels for our hotels. Additionally, we have an unconsolidated 48.6% membership interest in Brownmill, which owns two retail properties located in New Jersey that have been subject to various restrictions. If Brownmill’s retail properties are negatively impacted for an extended period because our tenants are unable to pay their rent, our equity earnings and the carrying value of our investment in Brownmill could be materially and adversely impacted. 
 
In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating results of our hotels, we have taken various actions to preserve our liquidity, including, but not limited to, those described below:
 

● | We implemented cost reduction strategies for all of our hotels, leading to reductions in certain operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amendments to Revolving Credit Facility – On June 2, 2020, our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) was amended to provide for (i) the deferral of the six monthly debt service payments aggregating $2.6 million for the period from April 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020, which are now due on November 15, 2021; (ii) a 100 bps reduction in the interest rate spread to LIBOR + 2.15%, subject to a 3.00% floor, for the six-month period from September 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021; (iii) us pre-funding $2.5 million into a cash collateral reserve account to cover the six monthly debt service payments due from October 1, 2020 through March 1, 2021; and (iv) a waiver of all financial covenants for quarter-end periods before June 30, 2021. We and the lender have agreed in principle to certain amendments to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, that we expect will be finalized shortly, that provide for (i) us to pledge our membership interest in another hotel as additional collateral within 45 days, (ii) us to fund an additional $2.5 million into the cash collateral reserve account; (iii) a waiver of all financial covenants for quarter-end periods through September 30, 2021 with a phased-in gradual return to the full financial covenant requirements over the quarter-end periods beginning December 31, 2021 through March 31, 2023; (iv) an extension of the maturity date from May 17, 2021 to September 15, 2022 upon completion of the pledge of the additional collateral; (v) one additional one-year extension option at the lender’s sole discretion; and (vi) certain limitations and restrictions on asset sales and additional borrowings related to the pledged collateral. We intend to timely pledge the additional collateral and extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 15, 2021. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Paycheck Protection Program Loans - In April 2020, our hotels received $3.3 million from loans provided under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Loans”). Subsequently, during the first quarter of 2021, our hotels received an additional $3.7 million from PPP Loans. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly distributions and, as a result, did not declare any distributions on our Common Shares during 2020. Additionally, on March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the suspension of all redemptions under our shareholder redemption program. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2020, we had approximately $7.2 million of funds released to it from an escrow account. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the lender have agreed in principle to various amendments to its non-recourse mortgage loan secured by the Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City, which they expect will be finalized shortly. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on these actions, along with our cash and cash equivalents on hand, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.
 
Competition 

The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
 
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay investments, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability make distributions to stockholders.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing owners the opportunity to contribute properties to Lightstone REIT II in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.

Environmental 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees 

We do not have employees. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
