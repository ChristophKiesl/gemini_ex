ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 27, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our “Business Combination”. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination utilizing cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, we initially focused our search on identifying a prospective target business in the media and entertainment (“M&E”) sector in North America, Europe and Asia. We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
Our board of directors unanimously approved a business combination agreement, dated March 3, 2021, by and among us, Anghami, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Anghami”), Anghami Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Anghami (“Pubco”), Anghami Vista 1, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Vistas Merger Sub”) and Anghami Vista 2, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Anghami Merger Sub”) (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”). If the Business Combination Agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the transactions under the Business Combination Agreement are consummated, we will merge with and into Vistas Merger Sub, with us surviving the merger and continuing as a subsidiary of Pubco and Anghami will merge with and into Anghami Merger Sub, with Anghami surviving the merger and continuing as a subsidiary of Pubco (such transactions, collectively, the “Business Combination”). See “Proposed Business Combination” below for more detail on this transaction. If the Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, we will continue to seek another business combination as described herein.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination and certain other actions related thereto by the Company’s stockholders, certain approvals or other determinations from regulatory authorities, as applicable, and the availability of a minimum amount of cash in the Trust Account (and/or from other specified sources, if necessary), after giving effect to redemptions by the Company’s public stockholders, if any.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our management team will leverage its skills, expertise and strong network within Hollywood, Bollywood and other international M&E industries to identify attractive target companies and provide guidance on the benefits of being a publicly-traded entity, including broader access to capital, liquidity for employee compensation and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.
 
In addition, we believe that we will be able to source potential targets from our sponsor’s and management’s contacts within private equity, investment banking, industry consulting firms, accounting firms, and investors in the M&E sector. Upon completion of the Public Offering, our management team and sponsor will communicate with their networks on our acquisition criteria and immediately begin screening opportunities.
 
Business Combination Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified parameters and criteria that we think are important and relevant in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will apply these parameters in evaluating prospects, even though we may ultimately decide to execute our initial business combination with a fundamentally strong company that may not exactly match all of our initial parameters and criteria.

● | Management: We will seek companies with a proven and experienced existing management team that is eager to take advantage of the experience and expertise that our management team brings with it. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth: We intend to seek companies with high growth trajectories within the M&E industry that are driven by competitive advantages that can be accelerated through a partnership with us. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus: We will prioritize entities within digital content production and distribution (e.g. OTT and video on demand), digital animation and visual effects and media technology businesses, which we believe have benefited from the digitalization of media around the world. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strategy: We intend to screen for management teams with the appetite and ability to execute various strategic initiatives, with an emphasis on those focused on creating shareholder value. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operational Efficiencies: We intend to seek companies that have diligent compliance and reporting processes, and financial controls in place and are thus prepared for the regulatory requirements of a public entity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being Public: We intend to seek target companies that have the vision to take advantage of and appreciate the benefits of operating as a publicly-traded entity, including broader access to capital, liquidity for employee compensation and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential: We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have multiple and diverse potential drivers of revenue and earnings growth. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong and stable free cash flow.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive Valuations: We consider ourselves to be rigorous, disciplined and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value, upside and potential downside risks. We intend to seek companies with a decent market share and growth potential in the segments in which they operate, but available at a discount to valuation given the current economic environment due to the impact of COVID-19. We expect COVID-19 to disrupt a number of companies within the M&E industry, and we will seek to identify target companies that are also less vulnerable to pandemics and similar events.

The parameters mentioned above are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the underwriters’ marketing fee and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination and that any such business combination be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Both of these conditions will be satisfied with the proposed Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects.

If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. We expect all of the funds released from the trust account to be used for payment of the consideration in connection with the Business Combination.
 
Other than the proposed Business Combination, we have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any other business combination target. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in our securities to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business other than Anghami with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
 
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On March 3, 2021, the Company entered into the Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to which (i) the Company will merge with and into Vistas Merger Sub, with the Company surviving the merger and continuing as a subsidiary of Pubco, with each outstanding share of the Company converting into the right to receive one share of Pubco and each outstanding warrant of the Company converting into warrants to purchase shares of Pubco on the same terms (the “Vistas Merger”), and (ii) Anghami will merge with and into Anghami Merger Sub, with Anghami surviving the merger and continuing as a subsidiary of Pubco and Anghami’s shareholders receiving shares of Pubco (the “Anghami Merger”). Upon consummation of the Business Combination, Anghami and the Company will continue to exist as wholly-owned subsidiaries of Pubco.
 
The Business Combination implies an initial pro-forma enterprise valuation of the combined company of approximately $220 million. Upon the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), Anghami’s shareholders will be entitled to receive either all stock consideration or a combination of cash and stock consideration with an aggregate value of $180 million.
 
The stock consideration payable to Anghami’s shareholders will be an amount of shares of Pubco equal to (a) $180 million in enterprise value minus the cash consideration paid to such shareholders (if any), divided by (b) $10.00.
 
Anghami shareholders will receive cash consideration only if the available cash (as further described below) exceeds $50,000,000, in which case the cash consideration will be calculated as the lesser of (i)(A) such available cash minus the outstanding indebtedness of Pubco for borrowed money with a maturity date of more than one year as of the Closing multiplied by (B) 0.3, or (ii) the available cash minus such indebtedness referred to in clause (i)(A) above minus $50,000,000. The available cash at Closing will be calculated by (i) adding the amount available to be released from the Company’s trust account, after taking into account redemptions by the Company’s stockholders, in addition to any cash or cash equivalents of the Company and the net proceeds of private placements of shares of the Company’s common stock to occur immediately prior to the Closing, for which the Company currently has commitments of $40 million, and (ii) subtracting transaction expenses of the Company and Anghami related to the Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cash consideration payable to Anghami shareholders will be reduced, and shareholders will receive a proportional increase in stock consideration at a price of $10.00 per share, by the minimum amount necessary for Pubco to satisfy the “substantiality” test of Treasury Regulation 1.367(a)-3(c)(3)(iii), but if such “substantiality” test cannot be met if the cash consideration is reduced to zero (with the proportional increase in stock consideration) then no such reduction in cash consideration will be made.

Pubco’s board of directors will consist of eleven individuals allocated among three classes, and a majority of those directors will qualify as independent directors under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). Immediately after the Closing, the following individuals will be designated and appointed to the Pubco board of directors: (i) three directors designated by the Company prior to the Closing, including at least two who qualify as independent directors under Nasdaq rules, with none appointed to the first class, two appointed to the second class and one appointed to the third class; (ii) six directors designated by Anghami prior to the Closing, including at least three who qualify as independent directors under Nasdaq rules, with one appointed to the first class, two appointed to the second class, and three appointed to the third class; and (iii) two directors designated by Shuaa Capital psc (“Shuaa”), both appointed to the first class and at least one of whom will qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules. In the event the number of directors on the board changes prior to the Closing, the rights to designate directors will be adjusted such that Anghami will retain the ability to designate a majority of the directors.
 
The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of the Company and Anghami and its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Business Combination.
 
The closing of the Business Combination is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among other things: (i) the approval by the Company’s stockholders of the Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination, and certain other actions related thereto; (ii) Anghami and the Company each receiving evidence that Pubco qualifies as a foreign private issuer pursuant to Rule 3b-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the Closing; (iii) the Company having at least $40 million of cash at the closing of the Business Combination, consisting of cash held in its trust account and the aggregate amount of cash actually invested in (or contributed to) the Company pursuant to the Subscription Agreements (as defined below), after giving effect to redemptions of public shares, if any, but before giving effect to the consummation of the closing of the Business Combination and the payment of Anghami’s and the Company’s outstanding transaction expenses as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) the shares of Class A common stock of Pubco to be issued in connection with the Business Combination having been approved for listing on Nasdaq subject only to official notice of issuance thereof and (v) the execution of the Sponsor Agreement Amendment and the Registration Rights Agreement.
 
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by the Company or Anghami under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) by written consent of the Company and Anghami, (ii) by either the Company or Anghami if the closing of the Business Combination has not occurred on or before December 31, 2021, and (iii) by the Company or Anghami if the Company has not obtained the required approval of its stockholders.
 
We will hold a special meeting of stockholders to consider matters relating to the Business Combination. We cannot complete the Business Combination unless our stockholders consent to the approval of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. We will send to our stockholders a proxy statement/prospectus to ask them to vote in favor of these and the other matters described in such proxy statement/prospectus.
