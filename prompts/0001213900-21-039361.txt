ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW



Cinedigm Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000 (“Cinedigm”, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”). Cinedigm is (i) a leading independent distributor and aggregator of independent film and television content rights distributed across digital, over-the-top (OTT), physical, and home and mobile entertainment platforms as well as (ii) a leading servicer of digital cinema assets on over 6,200 domestic and foreign movie screens.



Over the past several years, Cinedigm has transformed itself from being a digital cinema equipment and physical content distributor to a leading independent streaming company with the planned phasing out of its legacy projector division.




Cinedigm is a leading independent streaming entertainment company serving global enthusiast fan bases. Since our inception, we have played a significant role in the digital distribution revolution that continues to transform the media and entertainment landscape. Cinedigm delivers high-quality, curated content through subscription video on demand (SVOD), dedicated ad-supported (AVOD) and free ad-supported streaming linear (FAST) channels.




Cinedigm’s broad portfolio enables the Company to achieve significant market share on every key consumer streaming device and platform. As the Company achieves distribution to multiple, high-growth territories on a global basis, the Company expects each of these channels will generate high-margin annual revenues to Cinedigm. As its channel portfolio has grown, the Company’s viewership and subscription metrics have grown significantly. The Company currently reaches over 23.8 million streaming channel monthly active viewers. The Company controls a library of over 33,000 film & TV assets, 16 different enthusiast streaming brands across 19 live streaming channels, and over 640,000 subscribers (SVOD) reaching 900 million unique streaming devices globally.



Cinedigm has been a technological pioneer over its history and continues to be one today. Through its world-class, proprietary streaming technology, the Company has become a partner of choice for content producers, rightsholders, and major media companies seeking to monetize their content in the streaming ecosystem. The Company’s streaming technology platform, known as MatchpointTM, is a software-as-a-service platform which automates the distribution of streaming content and OTT channels. The Company has a long legacy in using technology to transform the entertainment industry, and played a pioneering role in transitioning over 11,000 movie screens from traditional analog film prints to digital distribution.



Cinedigm is a leading distributor of independent film and television content. The Company operates a growing portfolio of owned and operated over-the-top (“OTT”) streaming entertainment channels. The Company distributes content for major brands such as Hallmark, Televisa, ITV, Nelvana, ZDF, Konami, NFL, and NHL as well as leading international and domestic content creators, movie producers, television producers and other short form digital content producers. Cinedigm collaborates with producers, major brands and other IP owners to market, source, curate and distribute quality content to targeted audiences through (i) existing and emerging digital home entertainment platforms, including Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Xbox, Tubi, PlutoTV, Vudu and cable/satellite video-on-demand (“VOD”) and (ii) packaged distribution of DVD and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers with sales coverage to over 48,000 retail storefronts, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Amazon.




The Company is well positioned in a changing media and entertainment landscape. Cinedigm is capitalizing on an evolving competitive environment where the top of the streaming industry is consolidating including competitors such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and Disney Plus while Cinedigm has a complimentary offering as a leading independent distributor with a focus on the enthusiast segment of the market. The company believes the enthusiast segment, focusing on audiences and genres underserved by the major streamers, will be a significant opportunity on a global basis. Today, the Company operate properties in numerous specialty sectors, including faith and family, science fiction, horror, kids, and other major segments. Given our extensive experience in operating and distributing enthusiast content, as well as the Company’s significantly improved financial position, the Company has begun executing an M&A roll-up strategy with a focus on enthusiast channels, content, and supporting technology. Over the past two years, the Company has acquired numerous channels and content libraries. The Company is actively focused on integrating the most recent acquisitions, as well as building and launching a variety of associated critical products, including: Fantawild, Fandor, The Film Detective, Screambox, Films Around the World and other initiatives driving major technological changes in the entertainment industry.

The Company announced its acquisition of FoundationTV on March 8, 2021, which was consummated on June 9, 2021, and the formation of Cinedigm India, its wholly-owned subsidiary formed to house FoundationTV. In addition to powering Cinedigm’s portfolio of streaming channels and digital video distribution business, the new division will allow Cinedigm to expand their global streaming footprint. The Company is developing a channel umbrella with global reach, which is expected to further enable growth and profitability.

Starrise’s ordinary shares (HK 1616) are listed on the main board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Based on the closing price of HKD 0.15 per share on July 23, 2021, calculated at an exchange rate of $7.7698 Hong Kong Dollars to 1 US dollar, Cinedigm’s ownership in Starrise ordinary shares was approximately $7.0 million.

Risk and Uncertainties



The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions created significant volatility and uncertainty impacting the Company’s results for the year. As part of our Content & Entertainment business, the Company sells DVDs and Blu-ray discs at brick-and-mortar stores. With the closure of non-essential retail stores beginning in the spring of 2020, the sale of physical discs through our retail partners declined although this was partially offset by digital purchases of physical product. As part of our Cinema Equipment business, the Company earns revenue when movies are exhibited in theaters. Many movie theaters in the United States closed during the spring of 2020 and remained closed or re-opened on a limited basis through March 31, 2021. The majority of major studios shifted films out of the fiscal year to dates when more screens would be available, and consumers felt safe to return to theaters. Films released during the year had box office results below pre-Covid expectations due to theater closure, limited capacity and new commercial models that permitted viewing day and date via premium video on demand (“PVOD”) and subscription video on demand (“SVOD”). To the extent films are not shown in theaters, we do not earn revenue.



Longer term, there may be a shift in consumer preference towards digital consumption over physical or theatrical viewing. Studios may reduce their theatrical slates to tentpoles and certain genres releasing other content directly on their own streaming services. This decision could negatively impact the Company’s ability to license content for the sale of physical product, if those rights are withheld to create exclusivity to the platform and reduce revenue opportunities for virtual print fees and sales of digital cinema equipment. While the Company has been encouraged by the pace of mass vaccinations, spikes or the emergence of new variants could require future closures.



CONTENT & ENTERTAINMENT



Content Distribution and our Enthusiast Streaming Channels



Cinedigm Entertainment Group, or CEG, is a leading independent content distributor in North America.

From time to time, the Company will announce channel development deals with a variety of media companies. The timeline for planning and launching a channel varies from months to years and is also dependent on carriage conversations with a wide array of platforms and distributors. We announced three channels in 2020 that remain in development through 2021:




● | LIVX, a music and entertainment channel 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Party Crashers, a political news channel 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AudPop, a short form entertainment channel 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The digital channels market is a nascent industry, and from time to time, the Company will cease operating or distributing channels that do not find adequate audiences or meet the needs of platforms or audiences. In the prior fiscal year, we elected to cease operating or distributing the following channels:




● | Bambu, a Chinese entertainment linear channel owned and operated by Cinedigm 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hallypop, a Korean music and lifestyle linear channel distributed by Cinedigm 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CombatGo, an international combat sports linear channel distributed by Cinedigm 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We distribute our streaming channels in several distinct ways: direct to consumer, through major application platforms such as the web, iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Vizio, and Samsung; and through third party distributors of content on emerging platforms such as Amazon Prime, Twitch, Xumo and Sling/ Dish, and a wide variety of Smart TV manufacturers globally. Through our rapidly expanding base of distribution arrangements, Cinedigm has an estimated addressable device footprint of more than 330 million devices in North America and more than 370 million internationally. Our focus in the near term will be to expand our market position in the FAST and AVOD divisions of the streaming industry, taking advantage of the shift of more than $70 billion dollars in television advertising revenue to the OTT market. We believe our scale channel portfolio, our superior capabilities in launching and managing channels at scale, and our strategic partnerships with key content owners and platforms will provide us a strategic advantage to gain considerable market share in the immediate future.

Our Strategy



The shift from traditional entertainment consumption to streaming is accelerating. We believe that our large library of film and television episodes, long-standing relationships with digital platforms, state of the art technologies and years of experience operating and growing streaming audiences will allow us to continue to build a diversified portfolio of enthusiasts OTT channels that generate recurring revenue streams from advertising, merchandising and subscriptions. We believe that our success, market leadership and scale will continue to attract strong brands and media companies who bring name recognition, high-quality film and television content, and strong marketing support (together our “Streaming” business).



We believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the streaming channel business for the following key reasons:




● | More than 13 years of experience as a primary distributor of content to scale 3rd party OTT platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple iTunes and more, and nearly seven years of history operating OTT channels with millions of downloads, hundreds of thousands of registered users, and hundreds of millions of discrete data points on our customer’s behavior and preferences, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The depth and breadth of our almost 33,000 title film and television episode library, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our digital assets and deep, long-standing relationships as launch partners that cover the major digital platforms and devices, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our marketing expertise,
--+-------------------------


● | Our flexible releasing strategies, which differ from larger entertainment companies that need to protect their legacy businesses,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our proprietary streaming technology enabling us to operate at scale and at lower operating costs than our competitors, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our experienced management team 
--+------------------------------------

CINEMA EQUIPMENT BUSINESS



The Phase I Deployment and Phase II Deployment operations consist of the following:




Operations of: | Products and services provided: 
------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cinema Equipment Business | Financing vehicles and administrators for 3,122 Systems installed nationwide in our first deployment phase (“Phase I Deployment”) to theatrical exhibitors and for 3,104 Systems installed domestically and internationally in our second deployment phase (“Phase II Deployment”). We retain ownership of our digital cinema equipment (the “Systems”) and the residual cash flows related to the Systems in Phase I Deployment after the after the end of the 10-year deployment payment period. For certain Phase II Deployment Systems, we do not retain ownership of the residual cash flows and digital cinema equipment in Phase II Deployment after the completion of cost recoupment and at the expiration of the exhibitor master license agreements. The Cinema Equipment Business also provides monitoring, collection, verification and management services to this segment, as well as to exhibitors who purchase their own equipment, and also collects and disburses VPFs from motion picture studios, and distributors and ACFs from alternative content providers, movie exhibitors and theatrical exhibitors (collectively, “Services”). 

PHASE I DEPLOYMENT AND PHASE II DEPLOYMENT



In June 2005, we formed our Phase I Deployment division in order to purchase up to 4,000 Systems under an amended framework agreement with Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc. (“Christie”). As of March 31, 2021, Phase I Deployment had 3,122 Systems installed.



In October 2007, we formed our Phase II Deployment division for the administration of up to 10,000 additional Systems. As of March 31, 2021, Phase II Deployment had 3,104 of such Systems installed.



Our Phase I Deployment and Phase II Deployment divisions own and license Systems to theatrical exhibitors and collect virtual print fees (“VPFs”) from motion picture studios and distributors, as well as alternative content fees (“ACFs”) from alternative content providers and theatrical exhibitors, when content is shown on exhibitors’ screens. We have licensed the necessary software and technology solutions to the exhibitor and have facilitated the industry’s transition from analog (film) to digital cinema. As part of the Phase I Deployment of our Systems, we have agreements with nine motion picture studios and certain smaller independent studios and exhibitors, allowing us to collect VPFs and ACFs when content is shown in theatres, in exchange for having facilitated and financed the deployment of Systems. Cinedigm Digital Funding I, LLC (“Phase 1 DC”) has agreements with 17 theatrical exhibitors that license our Systems in order to show digital content distributed by the motion picture studios and other providers, including Content & Entertainment, which is described below.



Beginning in December 2015, certain of our digital cinema equipment began to reach the conclusion of their 10-year deployment payment period with certain distributors and, therefore, revenues ceased to be recognized on such Systems, related to such distributors. Furthermore, because the Phase I Deployment installation period ended in November 2007, a majority of the VPF revenue associated with the Phase I Deployment Systems has ended. As of March 31, 2021, all of our 3,122 systems from the Phase I Deployment phase of our cinema equipment business segment had ceased to earn a significant portion of VPF revenue from certain major studios, although various other studios, consisting mostly of small independent studios, continued to pay VPFs through March 31, 2021. We expect to continue to earn such ancillary revenue from the cinema equipment segment through December of 2021; however, such amounts are expected to be significantly less material to our consolidated financial statements. The reduction in VPF revenue on cinema equipment business systems approximately coincided with the conclusion of certain of our non-recourse debt obligations and, therefore, the reduced cash outflows related to such non-recourse debt obligations partially offset the reduced VPF revenue since November 2017.

Under the terms of our standard cinema equipment licensing agreements, exhibitors will continue to have the right to use our Systems through the end of the term of the licensing agreement, after which time, they have the option to: (1) return the Systems to us; (2) renew their license agreement for successive one-year terms; or (3) purchase the Systems from us at fair market value. As permitted by these agreements, we have begun, and expect to continue, to pursue the sale of the Systems to such exhibitors. Such sales were as originally contemplated as the conclusion of the digital cinema deployment plan. Cinedigm completed the sale of approximately 2,177 digital projection Systems for an aggregate sales price of approximately $6.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2021.



Our Phase II Deployment division has entered into digital cinema deployment agreements with eight motion picture studios, and certain smaller independent studios and exhibitors, to distribute digital movie releases to exhibitors equipped with our Systems, for which we and our wholly owned, non-consolidated subsidiary Cinedigm Digital Funding 2, LLC (“CDF2 Holdings”) earn VPFs. As of March 31, 2021, our Phase II Deployment division has master license agreements with 102 exhibitors covering 3,104 screens, whereby the exhibitors agreed to install our Systems. As of March 31, 2021, we had 3,104 Access Digital Phase 2 Corp. (“Phase 2 DC”) Systems installed, including 1,717 screens under the exhibitor-buyer structure (“Exhibitor-Buyer”), and 1,387 screens covering 23 exhibitors through CDF2.



Exhibitors paid us an installation fee of up to $2.0 thousand per screen out of the VPFs collected by our Services division. We manage the billing and collection of VPFs and remit to exhibitors all VPFs collected, less an administrative fee of approximately 10%. For Phase 2 DC Systems we own and finance on a non-recourse basis, we typically received a similar installation fee of up to $2.0 thousand per screen and an ongoing administrative fee of approximately 10% of VPFs collected. We have recorded no debt, property and equipment, financing costs or depreciation in connection with Systems covered under the Exhibitor-Buyer Structure and CDF2 Holdings.



VPFs are earned pursuant to contracts with movie studios and distributors, whereby amounts are payable to our Phase I and Phase II deployment businesses according to fixed fee schedules, when movies distributed by studios are displayed in movie theatres using our installed Systems. One VPF is payable to us upon the initial booking of a movie, for every movie title displayed per System. Therefore, the amount of VPF revenue that we earn depends on the number of unique movie titles released and displayed using our Systems. Our Phase II Deployment division earns VPF revenues only for Systems that it owns.



Our Phase II Deployment agreements with distributors require payment of VPFs for ten years from the date that each system is installed; however, we may no longer collect VPFs once “cost recoupment,” as defined in the contracts with movie studios and distributors, is achieved. Cost recoupment will occur once the cumulative VPFs and other cash receipts collected by us have equaled the total of all cash outflows, including the purchase price of all Systems, all financing costs, all “overhead and ongoing costs,” as defined, subject to maximum agreed upon amounts during the four-year roll-out period and thereafter. Furthermore, if cost recoupment occurs before the end of the eighth contract year, a one-time “cost recoupment bonus” is payable to us by the studios. Cash flows, net of expenses, received by our Phase II Deployment business, following the achievement of cost recoupment, must be returned to the distributors on a pro-rata basis. At this time, we cannot estimate the timing or probability of the achievement of cost recoupment.



Customers



No single Phase I or Phase II customer comprised more than 10% of our consolidated revenue.



Seasonality



Revenues earned by our Cinema Equipment Business segment from the collection of VPFs from motion picture studios are seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of movies by the motion picture studios. Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable movies during the summer and the winter holiday season. The unexpected emergence of a hit movie during other periods can alter the traditional trend. The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or any other quarter. The seasonality of motion picture exhibition; however, has become less pronounced as the motion picture studios are releasing movies somewhat more evenly throughout the year.

SERVICES



Our Services division provides monitoring, billing, collection, verification and other management services to Phase 1 DC and Phase 2 DC as well as to exhibitor-buyers who purchase their own equipment. Our Services division provides such services to the 3,122 screens in the Phase I Deployment for a monthly service fee equal to 5% of the VPFs earned by Phase 1 DC and an incentive service fee equal to 2.5% of the VPFs earned by Phase 1 DC. The Services division also provides services to the 3,104 Phase II Systems deployed, for which we typically receive a monthly fee of approximately 10% of the VPFs earned by Phase 2 DC. The total Phase II service fees are subject to an annual limitation under the terms of our agreements with motion picture studios and are determined based upon the respective Exhibitor-Buyer Structure, or CDF2 agreements. Unpaid service fees in any period remain an obligation to Phase 2 DC in the cost recoupment framework. Such fees are not recognized as income or accrued as an asset on our balance sheet given the uncertainty of the receipt and the timing thereof as future movie release and bookings are not known. Service fees are accrued and recognized only on deployed Phase II Systems. As a result, the annual service fee limitation is variable until these fees are paid.



In February 2013, we (i) assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, Cinedigm DC Holdings LLC (“DC Holdings”), the right and obligation to service the digital cinema projection systems from the Phase I Deployment and certain systems that were part of the Phase II Deployment, (ii) delegated to DC Holdings the right and obligation to service certain other systems that were part of the Phase II Deployment and (iii) assigned to DC Holdings the right to receive servicing fees from the Phase I and Phase II Deployments. We also transferred to DC Holdings certain of our operational staff whose responsibilities and activities relate solely to the operation of the servicing business and to provide DC Holdings with the right to use the supporting software and other intellectual property associated with the operation of the servicing business.



Our Services division also has international servicing partnerships in Australia and New Zealand with the Independent Cinema Association of Australia and serviced 107 screens as of March 31, 2021, at which time we ceased providing servicing to such parties.



Competition



Our Services division faces limited competition domestically in its digital cinema services business as the major Hollywood movie studios have only signed digital cinema deployment agreements with five entities, including us, and the deployment period in North America is now complete. Competitors include: Digital Cinema Implementation Partners (“DCIP”), a joint venture of three large exhibitors (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.) focused on managing the conversions of those three exhibitors; Sony Digital Cinema, to support the deployment of Sony projection equipment; Christie Digital USA, Inc., to support the deployment of Christie equipment; and GDC, Inc., to support the deployment of GDC equipment. We have a significantly greater market share than all other competitors except for the DCIP consortium, which services approximately 18,000 total screens representing its consortium members.



As we expand our servicing platform internationally, additional competitors beyond those listed above consist of Arts Alliance, Inc., a leading digital cinema servicer focused on the European markets, and GDC, as well as other potential local start-ups seeking to service a specific international market. We typically seek to partner with a leading local entity to combine our efficient servicing infrastructure and strong studio relationships with the necessary local market expertise and exhibitor relationships.



ENVIRONMENTAL



The nature of our business does not subject us to environmental laws in any material manner.
