Our Business
 
China XD Plastics Company Limited ("China XD", "we", and the "Company", and "us" or "our" shall be interpreted accordingly) is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates ("UAE").  Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Heilongjiang Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited ("HLJ Xinda Group"), Sichuan Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited ("Sichuan Xinda"), and AL Composites Materials FZE ("Dubai Xinda"), we manufacture and sell polymer composite materials (a broader category including modified plastics), primarily for automotive applications. We develop our products using our proprietary technology through our wholly-owned research laboratory owned by HLJ Xinda Group. We had 633 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2019. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang Province. Our research and development (the "R&D") team consisted of 131 professionals and 6 consultants as of December 31, 2019. As a result of the combination of our academic and technological expertise, we had a portfolio of 509 patents, among which we have obtained 32 patent registrations in China, and the applications for the remaining 477 were pending in China as of December 31, 2019. 
 
Modified plastics are produced by changing the physical and/or chemical characteristics of ordinary resin materials. In order for plastics to be used to produce automobile parts and components, they must satisfy certain physical criteria in terms of mechanical functionality, stability under light and heat, durability, flame resistance, and environmental friendliness. Our unique proprietary formulas and processing techniques enable us to produce low-cost high-quality modified plastic materials, which have been certified by many of the major domestic and international automobile manufacturers in China. In addition, we also provide specially engineered plastics and environment-friendly plastics for use in oil-field equipment, mining equipment, vessel-propulsion systems and power station equipment.
 
China XD's primary end-market is the Chinese automotive industry that has been rapidly growing for the past few years where our modified plastics are used by our customers to fabricate the following auto components: exteriors (automobile bumpers, rearview and sideview mirrors, license plate parts), interiors (door panels, dashboard, steering wheel, glove compartment and safety belt components), and functional components (air conditioner casing, heating and ventilation casing, engine covers, and air ducts). Our specialized plastics are utilized in more than 31 automobile brands manufactured in China, including leading brands such as Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. As of December 31, 2019, 633 of HLJ Xinda Group's automotive-specific modified plastic products were certified by one or more of the automobile manufacturers in China and are in commercial production. As of December 31, 2019, 357 of our products were in the process of product certification by automobile manufacturers. After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic about the prospect of our business expansion overseas.
 
We operate three manufacturing bases in Harbin, Heilongjiang and one manufacturing base in Nanchong, Sichuan Province, in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"), as well as a manufacturing base in Dubai, UAE. As of December 31, 2019, in domestic market, we had approximately 394,200 metric tons of production capacity across 91 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwanese conveyer systems. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems.   In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines.

Corporate Structure
 
The following table sets forth our group structure as of December 31, 2019:
 

Our Industry 
 
According to a research report prepared exclusively for the Company and issued by Frost & Sullivan in 2020, China is estimated to have consumed approximately 25.3 million Metric Tons ("MT") of modified plastic products in 2019, representing an increase of 6.3% compared to 2018. With China being the world's leading manufacturing center and with rising domestic individual consumption, we believe that demand for modified plastics from China will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. As shown in Figure 1, the market demand for modified plastics will reach 33.2 million MT in 2023, representing compound annual growth rates ("CAGR") of 7.0% and 6.0% by sales volume and revenues from 2019 to 2023. Currently, demand for our products is primarily driven by the Chinese automotive industry. In order for plastics to be used in automobile parts and components, they must satisfy specific physical criteria in terms of mechanical functionality, stability under light and heat, durability, flame resistance, and environmental friendliness. Modified plastics are usually found in interior materials, door panels, dashboards, mud flaps, chassis, bumpers, oil tanks, gas valves, grilles, unit heater shells, air conditioner shells, heat dissipating grids, wheel covers, and other components.

Figure 1: Analysis of Chinese Modified Plastics Market: Sales Volume and Revenue, China 2013-2023E
 


According to Frost & Sullivan's report, stimulated by the development of China's automotive industry, the Chinese automotive modified plastics market has gained solid development from 2013 to 2018, with a CAGR of 10.7% in sales volume and 8.4% in sales revenue during this period. In 2019, given the slow-down of China’s automotive production, sales volume of modified plastics will be negatively affected. Going onwards, considering the lightweight trend of automotive development and demand on using modified plastics to replace steel, the market is expected to maintain a moderate increase in terms of both sales volume and sales revenue, with CAGRs of 7.0% and 6.0% from 2019 to 2023, respectively.
 

The production capacity is expected to reach 7.3 million MT in 2023, with a growth of 27.4% from 5.8 million MT in 2018. In terms of different manufacturer types, domestic manufacturers expanded their production more rapidly than non-local manufacturers, which accounted for 75.3% of the total production capacity in 2018 and is expected to take up to 78.3% by the end of 2023.

Due to the drop of crude oil price since the latter half of 2014, market price of modified plastics has experienced an obvious decrease, which undulates sales revenue of the market in 2015. Since the growth of China’s automotive industry is slowing down, automotive modified plastics manufacturers has also decreased the expansion rate of their production capacities. Overall, the total production capacity of Chinese automotive modified plastics industry increased significantly in the past and will keep growing in the future.




As illustrated in Figure 2, the Chinese automotive modified plastics market is expected to maintain the decent increase, with CAGR of 7.0% and 6.0% in terms of both sales volume and sales revenue from 2019 to 2023, respectively. In terms of different manufacturer types, domestic manufacturers expanded their production more rapidly than non-local manufacturers, which accounted for 75.3% of the total production capacity in 2018 and is expected to take up to 78.3% by the end of 2023. We believe that the demand for automotive modified plastic in China will grow continuously due to the fast growing Chinese automotive market, the increasing use per unit of plastic content in automobiles and favorable government incentives and regulations. Moreover, domestic producers will likely gain larger market share from imports as they are able to manufacture products with comparable quality at highly competitive prices and close proximity to their customers. We believe that the following are the key drivers for the automotive modified plastic industry in China.

According to the statistics by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers ("CAAM") in 2018, the production volume of automobiles in China increased from 22,116.8 thousand units in 2013 to 27,809.2 thousand units in 2018. Decline in automotive production is noted in 2018 and 2019 due to the weakened market demand as well as the reducing incentives granted by Chinese government to automotive manufacturers especially for EV manufacturers. The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 creates future disturbance to the market, and affects normal business operation of automotive manufacturers. Production volume is anticipated to recover from second quarter of 2020 as the disease gradually becomes under control. The growth of Chinese automotive industry is expected to slow down after several years’ rapid development and the CAGR of automotive production will be around 2.2% during the period from 2019 to 2023. Passenger cars accounted for 85% of the total production volume in 2018. The production volume of passenger cars and commercial cars will grow at a CAGR of 2.1% and 2.2% respectively during the period from 2019 to 2023. China has exceeded the United States to become the world's largest auto market as measured by the number of automobiles sold. We believe the growth momentum in China's auto sales will remain strong over the next four years. The automotive industry in China is still in its infancy with passenger car ownership of 166 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in 2018, which is significantly below Europe's average of 526 and United States' average of 781 according to National Bureau of Statistics, US Department of Energy, Eurosta, Frost & Sullivan.
 
From 2013 to 2018, the number of vehicles per 1,000 people in China has experienced a significant growth from 93 to 166, with the highest CAGR of 12.2% among China, United States and Europe. The significant gap of automobiles ownership per 1,000 people among China, United States and Europe indicates that the Chinese auto industry is still of huge growth potential. The gap is expected to be further narrowed with China’s vehicle per 1,000 people growing to 220 in 2023.

 Growth of Parc of Automobiles, China, 2013-2023E
 

Rising personal income in China is one of the key drivers for the rapid growth of the Chinese automobile industry. As shown in Figure 5, China has achieved long-term economic growth and the nominal GDP per capita increased from RMB 43,871.1 in 2013 to RMB 63,382.4 in 2018. There are several undergoing structural adjustments in China’s economy. It is expected that China will be able to maintain a relatively solid economic growth and nominal GDP per capita will keep growing during the period from 2019 to 2023.
 
Chinese government is attempting to stimulate the domestic consumption and has introduced a series of related incentive policies. Given that the income level of residents in China keeps increasing, the per capita consumption expenditure of urban household in China increased from RMB 18,023.0 in 2013 to RMB 26,112.0 in 2018 and is expected to reach RMB 37,427.4 in 2023.
 
Moreover, cars have become more affordable in China as local or joint venture automobile manufacturers continuously expand their production to achieve economies of scale to lower production cost and source cheaper auto parts locally. Growing income and decreasing vehicle prices will continue to make car ownership more affordable for China's rising middle class.

Benefit and Increasing Use of Plastics in Automobiles

(1) Cost Reduction: The primary demand driver for modified automotive plastics arises out of the cost-reduction characteristics evidenced by the plastics material inclusion in the automobile manufacturing process. Modified plastics can deliver the same performance as metallic materials at approximately a tenth of the cost. In addition, modified plastics can substitute some kinds of more expensive engineering plastics. This benefit of modified plastics will become more significant with the increasing competition in automobile manufacturing industry to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
 
(2) Vehicle Emissions Reduction: Plastic components impact fuel efficiency by saving approximately 2.5 liters of fuel per kilograms ("kg") used (equivalent to 6 kg of CO2 emissions) over the lifetime of the vehicle. Automobile manufacturers have been reducing vehicle weights in an attempt to reduce emissions and increase efficiencies. Modified plastics reduce the weight of components by 40% compared with traditional metallic materials.
 
(3) Performance and Safety Improvement: The development of advanced plastics applications lead to the improvement in performance through reducing the number and weight of the vehicle parts, causing the fuel consumption per vehicle to drop significantly. In addition, the lower net weight of the vehicles improves handling performance and thereby eliminates the likelihood of losing control in case of emergency stops. The involvement of modified plastics in automotive applications results in significant improvement of the safety features of the vehicle parts, like seat belts, air bags, and air bag containers in the recent years.
 
(4) New Applications:  Plastics reduce the number of the required parts used in automobile manufacturing and introduce new design possibilities. Conventional materials struggle to compete against this open innovation platform associated with the plastics industry. In addition, the performance benefits associated with plastic materials continue to create a competitive advantage for the plastics industry.
 
(5) Increasing Use of Plastics per Vehicle: Weight of modified plastics per vehicle in China continually increased from 2008 to 2012, and is forecasted to reach 169.8 kg by the end of 2017, with a growth rate of 40.2% according to Frost & Sullivan's Report. Although the weight of modified plastics per vehicle in China will still be less than that in North America and Europe, the highest growth rate indicates the huge potential for market growth. In 2012, plastic use in China is estimated to be about 128.6 kg per vehicle, whereas models imported from Europe contain on average as much as 219 kg per vehicle. In addition, the Chinese government's goals regarding electric and hybrid vehicles may also push the market further as weight concerns are more important for these vehicles than for traditional passenger cars.
 
Production volume of electric vehicle (EV) in China grew from 14.1 thousand units in 2012 to 794.2 thousand units in 2017 dramatically, with a CAGR of 123.9%. China is leading the development of EV industry and the largest market of EV in the world in 2017. Guided by the supportive policies, the EV industry will continue to be a development focus of auto industry in China.
 
The development of EV is a strong driver of auto modified plastics market since the production of battery packs for EV brings the demand for automotive modified plastics and the level of light-weight designs for EV is high.
 
Increasing Substitution of Imports
 
Though China's automotive plastic market has been dominated by foreign or joint venture ("JV") companies, Chinese suppliers are continually gaining market share. It is estimated that automotive plastics imported and manufactured by multinational and JV companies accounted for 24.9% of the total China automotive plastic supply in 2017, decreasing from 30.5% in 2012 according to a report by Frost & Sullivan. Compared to foreign competitors including JV companies, local manufacturers can largely benefit from the lower cost and geographical convenience in China and their product sales can be customized with time-efficient after sales services and technical supports. As the local production capacity of both domestic and foreign companies has been expanding, share of imports and multiple national companies is expected to decrease to 22.4% by the end of 2022, while the share of domestic manufacturers is forecast to rise to 77.6% in 2022 as they expand at a greater rate than MNC and JV in China.

The financial crisis beginning in 2008 and the European debt crisis beginning in 2011 forced global automakers and suppliers to concentrate on their cost structure and pricing mechanisms. Many automakers accelerated cost reduction initiatives. Moving manufacturing operations to and sourcing raw materials from low cost regions have emerged as key measures to save costs. With its huge consumer market, low labor costs and high-quality manufacturing and logistics infrastructure, China is a location favored by global auto and component makers who source parts and components not only for their local operations in China but also for their global operations. As a result, we believe that China's local plastic suppliers will benefit from such global outsourcing trends and increasingly become a good substitute for expensive imported plastic products. JV manufacturers based in China in automotive plastics sector have been slow to invest and expand in China.
 
Favorable National Government Policies 
 
 In the past decade, the Chinese government has adopted a number of policies and initiatives intended to encourage the development of the Chinese modified plastics industry and stimulate the growth of the Chinese automobile industry. 
 Since 2000, modified plastics, including engineering plastics, have been categorized as a prioritized industrialization area by a series of government guidelines or development plans. Some of these policies include: 
 
● Guiding Catalogue for Key Products and Services in Strategic Emerging Industries (2016) was announced by the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic in January 2017, which categorized new engineering plastics, plastic alloy, fire-retardant modified plastics, ABS, HIPS, high performance carbon fiber, etc.. as prior development fields in new material industry.
 
●  The 13th Five Year Plan for Development of Strategic Emerging Industries in China launched in 2016 included favorable policies toward advanced technologies in developing new aviation and space materials, encouraging the application of biodegradable plastics and the development of high-performance plastics used for additive manufacturing, as well as encouraging the development of new material industries
 
● The "Made in China 2025" initiative launched on May 8, 2015 by State Council, encouraged development of new materials, energy-saving and new energy vehicles, power equipment, aerospace and aeronautical equipment, marine engineering and high-tech ships, modern railway equipment and agricultural machinery.
 
● The "Development Plan of Additive Manufacturing (2015-2016)" initiative promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Ministry of Finance of People's Republic of China on February 28, 2015, advocated domestic production of several types of plastics with high heat resistance and high strength for additive manufacturing industry .
 
● It was stated in the "Outline of China's Twelfth Five-year Plan (2011)" that new functional materials, advanced structural materials, common base materials, fiber of high performance and its compounded material are key development directions of new material industry.
 
● It was stated in the "Catalogue for Guidance on Adjustment of Industrial Structure (2011)" promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission on March 27, 2011, that the country is currently promoting (i) the development of production equipment of polycarbonate by the use of non-phosgene method, with annual output of 60000t/year and above, (ii) the production of engineering plastic including liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and development and application of bleeding modification and alloying; (iii) the development and production of water – absorbed resin, conductible resin and biodegradable polymers; (iv) the development and production of new polyamide including nylon 11, nylon 1414 and nylon 46, nylon with long carbon chain and heat resistant nylon.
 
● It was stated in the "Guidance on Key Areas of Industrialization of High Technology with Current Priority in Development (2011)" jointly promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Commerce and the State Intellectual Property Office on June 23, 2011 that modified technologies applied to general plastics, including new engineering plastics and plastic alloy, new special engineering plastics, fire resistant modified plastics, and modified technology of general plastics, are currently prioritized areas to develop and industrialize in China's macromolecule materials sector.
 
It was stated in the "Investment Guide for Industrial Transforming and Upgrading" (2011) promulgated by  Ministry of  Industry and Information Technology of ghd People's Republic of China  promoted  the modification of waste plastics via the comprehensive utilization of related technologies and suggested the future trend of the application of new materials in the industrial area, including biodegradable plastics, engineering plastics, etc.

● A series of modified plastics technologies have been listed in the "National Support for Key High-tech Fields" as stated in the Circular on the Issuance of the Administrative Measure for the Recognition of High-tech Enterprise jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation in April 2008. These technologies include special engineering plastics, macromolecular compound or new synthetic modified, etc.
 
● Determining the detailed standards for average fuel consumption for passenger car manufacturers: 1) In 2015 average fuel consumption for passenger car reach 0.069L per kilometer; 2) In 2020 average fuel consumption for passenger car reach 0.05L per kilometer. It will accelerate the automobile weight reduction progress.
 
In addition, with the Chinese government strongly encouraging the production of more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles, as one means to help resolve the nation's worsening air pollution problem, especially in big cities, opportunities abound for suppliers of plastics materials and auto components.
 
We believe that the above government measures and programs will continue to accelerate the demand for automotive modified plastics in China.
 
Tightening Trend and Local Government Policies
 
Despite the favorable national government policies as set forth above, in the past couple of years, the Chinese government has implemented certain measures to control the pace of economic growth and discontinued certain stimulus measures implemented to deal with the recent global financial crisis, including incentives for consumers to purchase automobiles.
 
Since 2011, in order to resolve the extreme traffic congestion, Beijing government has been implementing a vehicle purchase quota policy, which limits the maximum vehicles sold in Beijing per month to 20,000. Other cities which have begun to show signs of traffic congestion have also begun to implement similar measures to control traffic congestion, including the limited automobile licenses policy implemented in Shanghai and Tianjin and the imposition of congestion charges in Shenzhen.  The termination of nation-wide preferential policies can negatively affect consumer demand for new vehicles, and local restrictive measures over automobile purchases in major cities may result in the reduction in the sale of vehicles nationwide.

Raw Materials
 
The principal raw materials used for the production of our modified plastic products are plastic resins such as polypropylene, ABS and nylon. Polypropylene is a chemical compound manufactured from petroleum.  ABS is a common thermoplastic used to make light, rigid, molded products such as automotive body parts and wheel covers.  Nylon is a thermoplastic silky material. Approximately 1.6% of our total raw materials purchased by volume are sourced from overseas petrochemical enterprises and 98.4% from domestic petrochemical enterprises during the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
The Company has one-year renewable contracts with its major suppliers, which are distributors of petrochemical enterprises. Because the raw materials used in our products are primarily petroleum products, the rise or fall in oil prices directly affects the cost of the raw materials. We attempt to mitigate the increase or decrease in our raw materials prices by appropriately raising or lowering the price for our products to pass the cost or savings to our customers as part of our pricing policy.
 
Because raw materials constitute a substantial part of the cost of our products, we seek to reduce costs by dealing with major suppliers. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased approximately 14.7% of the Company's raw materials from one major supplier. By dealing in large quantities with these major suppliers, we obtain reduced prices for raw materials, therefore reducing the cost of our products. If we were unable to purchase from these suppliers, we believe we would still have adequate sources of raw materials from other petrochemical distributors without material impact on the cost of our products.

Certification Process
 
To meet the requirements of an automobile manufacturer, products used as component parts must pass a rigorous certification process by the manufacturer's technological quality assurance department before they can be approved for and used in production. The certification process consists of three stages.
 
First, the automobile manufacturer reviews the manufacturer of modified plastics.  The examination involves assessment of the operation history of the modified plastics manufacturer, their experience in providing component services, the specialization of their factory equipment, their research and development capacity and quality assurance systems. The manufacturer's operations need to meet the requirements of the automobile manufacturer. Once the initial review is passed, the modified plastics manufacturer will obtain a qualification as an automobile component manufacturer. This initial stage takes approximately sixteen to twenty-two months to complete.
 
Second, the automobile manufacturer and the manufacturer of modified plastics reach an understanding about a product specification. The modified plastics manufacturer provides product research and development materials to the automobile manufacturer for inspection. The automobile manufacturer tests the product specification according to its standards and, if results are satisfactory, the modified plastics manufacturer obtains a product specification certification and enters the product certification stage. The second stage takes approximately eight months to complete.
 
Third, the parties complete technology R&D tests and perform automobile component finished parts tests.  The product undergoes additional testing by the automobile manufacturer and is used in road tests. This stage takes approximately five to fifteen months depending on whether the car model is an existing model or a new model. At the conclusion of the third stage, the modified plastics manufacturer receives a product certification from the automobile manufacturer.
 
We believe that the necessity, rigorousness, complexity and duration of the certification process make it difficult for outside competitors to enter the field in a short period of time. We had 633 certifications from automobile manufacturers as of December 31, 2019, which we believe is currently one of the largest portfolios of product certifications in the Chinese automobile modified plastics industry.

Sales and Marketing
 
Currently, our sales network focuses on the northeastern, northern, eastern and southwestern regions of China. We primarily sell to end customers through our approved distributors.  To a less extent, we also sell directly to end customers.  A typical customer development cycle starts when our R&D staff develops customized products for new end customers and obtains product certifications. These end customers are usually major automobile parts manufacturers who can only source from suppliers like China XD with product certifications granted by major automobile manufacturers. After we established relationships with these end customers and began to have large volume of transactions with them, we assign end customers to our approved distributors according to our internal policies. We also acquired end customers with our existing certifications from time to time. In 2019, approximately 82.9% of our sales were generated from approved distributors.
 
We enter into distribution agreements with local distributors in areas where large automobile manufacturers are located. The distribution agreements usually have a term of one year, during which period we can enter into distribution agreements with other distributors for our products. The distributors are responsible for marketing and distributing our products. Through the established sales channels, we can quickly respond to local market demand, address customer needs, enhance our ability to provide technical support and after-sales services, and lower our marketing expenses. Our general credit term with our distributors is three months and our collection of payment from distributors is not contingent upon their cash collection from end customers. We manufacture products according to orders received from our distributors and maintain a certain quantity of raw materials based on our experience and the distributors order patterns. By doing this we hope to ensure the smooth implementation of the production plan of major automobile manufacturers and avoid risks of inventory shortage. We do not provide the distributors nor end customers with the right of return, price protection or any other concessions.  We allow for an exchange of products or return only if the products are defective.
 
We have been actively engaging our distribution network with twelve distributors in 2019 and we believe we have good relationships with our distributors.  We believe that we have been able to secure and maintain strong relationships with end customers due to our existing certifications, advanced technologies and high product quality, which establish a higher barrier to entry for others. Most of the end customer relationships will be developed through our own R&D and sales force and maintained by our R&D and sales professionals and our distributors.  According to our distribution contracts, our distributors are prohibited from selling our competitors' products and required to use the product certificate, brand name and package standards set by us during the distribution period. After the expiration of the distribution contracts in absence of renewal, we retain the customer relationships with end customers.
 
While the pricing volatility of our raw materials is a primary cause of cost variations in our products, we are generally able to pass the cost of price changes in our raw materials to our customers, although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon volatility of raw material prices, the type of products, competitive conditions and individual customer arrangements.
 
We sell our products substantially through approved distributors in the PRC.  Our sales to our distributors are highly concentrated but have been gradually diversified in recent years. Sales to major distributors and direct customer, which individually exceeded 10% of our revenues, accounted for approximately 13.9% and 38.3% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to reduce our distributor concentration over time, although revenues from these distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue in the future. Further information about our major distributors and the director customer, which individually exceeded 10% of our revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, is set forth in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We have initiated our marketing efforts to develop new customers outside of China, in particular those in the UAE market. We have started offering certain high-end products, such as PA66 and long-chain Plastic Alloy, most manufactured in Heilongjiang plants and a small portion manufactured in Dubai plant since the second quarter of 2014. In January 2015, we completed and run the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products for the overseas markets. We plan to serve customers in oversea markets from our Dubai Xinda plant. In order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ("JAFZA") in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, we completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018. As of December 31, 2019, an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity mainly targeted for ABS products, were still in the progress of redesigning upgrading and further equipment testing. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, and will then increase the total production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.

After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, we have established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic about the prospect of our business expansion overseas.
 
Information about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Competition 
 
The PRC automotive modified plastics industry is growing rapidly and highly fragmented with the top four domestic producers occupying less than approximately 28.8% of the market shares in 2018 according to Frost & Sullivan's report. According to Frost & Sullivan's report, in terms of sales volume and production capacity, we are one of the leading domestic specialized manufacturers of modified plastic for automobile parts in China, with a market share of approximately 8.0% in 2018 and 8.8% in 2017. In 2019, our sales volume of automotive plastics was approximately 360,072 MT. As of December 31, 2019, our annual production capacity of automotive plastics was 405,450 MT.
 
Due to our high quality standard and competitive pricing, we are able to compete in and penetrate markets outside of China.
 
After a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic about the prospect of our business expansion overseas.
 
Currently, the Company's primary Chinese competitor in the automobile industry is Guangzhou Kingfa Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ("Guangzhou Kingfa"). Guangzhou Kingfa entered the automotive modified plastics market in 2006 and had a sales volume of 523,000 MT in 2018 with a market share of 11.0% in 2018, according to Frost & Sullivan’s report. Guangzhou Kingfa has the largest capacity expansion with 1.29 million MT annual production capacity, including 1.26 million MT annual modified plastics at the end of 2019 based on Guangzhou Kingfa's public disclosure, but its utilization rate of production capacity is expected to be lower than that of China XD based on Frost & Sullivan's report. Guangzhou Kingfa has much larger financial resources than HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. However, we believe that it is less focused in automotive sector and currently holds fewer number of product certifications for automotive modified plastic to the automobile industry compared to HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. Another top domestic manufacturer of modified plastic is Shanghai Pret Composites Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Pret"), which focuses on the production of automotive plastics.  It had a sales volume of 206,200 MT with a market share of 4.3% in 2018, according to Frost & Sullivan’s report.
 
Historically, the Chinese auto market predominantly used modified plastics manufactured overseas or in factories controlled by foreign companies, such as manufacturers from Germany, the US, the Netherlands and Japan. Although China's automotive plastic market has been dominated by foreign or JV players, Chinese suppliers are continuing to gain market share. It is estimated that automotive plastics imported or manufactured by multinational and JV companies accounted for approximately 24.7% of the total China automotive plastic supply in 2018, decreased from 30.5% in 2012. JV manufacturers based in China in automotive plastics sector have been slow to invest and expand in China. Compared to non-domestic competitors including JV manufacturers, domestic manufacturers can benefit from the lower costs and geographical proximity in China. As local players continue to invest in research and development, enhance product quality and improve management skills, we believe that domestic production of automotive plastics will compete very favorably with the foreign competitors in terms of price, quality, services and delivery times and continue to replace imported plastics.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths continue to enable us to compete effectively in the automotive modified plastics market in the PRC:
 

● | Leading Market Position in an Industry with High Barrier to Entry. We believe that we are one of the China's leading specialized manufacturers of modified plastic for automobile parts in terms of sales volume and production capacity, with a market share of approximately 8.0% in 2018. The PRC automotive modified plastics industry is growing rapidly and is highly fragmented with the top three domestic producers occupying less than approximately 23.3% of the market shares in 2018. We installed 50 new product lines in 2012 and 2013, which are utilized primarily for the manufacture of higher value-added modified plastics products. The lines increased the Company's total production capacity by 135,000 MT to 390,000 MT per annum. In July 2017, the Company launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics, which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020. The reason for such delay is due to additional time for equipment’s installation and test. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT as of December 31, 2018. Due to the need for equipment upgrade and overhaul, our Harbin campus further downgraded its production capacity to 135,000 MT as of December 31, 2019, in Qinling Road Factory (“Qinling Road Project”) and Jiangnan Road Factory (“Jiangnan Road Project”), which will be completed by end of the third quarter of 2020, bring the production capacity in Harbin campus back to 390,000 MT. Simultaneously, our Harbin campus also included an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory,, which was broken ground in December 2019 with four workshop. We expect a gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.

In December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which is expected to bring total domestic installed production annual capacity to 690,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013, mainly backed by production capacity in our Harbin production plant until we installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 at our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during 2017. We installed an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant for equipment installation, and we expect to put into production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.


In addition, we completed and run the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products for the overseas markets. In order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016, and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ("JAFZA") in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks.
 
As of December 31, 2019, our annual production capacity of automotive plastics totaled 405,450 MT, including 394,200 MT in domestic production bases and 11,250 in Dubai campus. In 2019, our sales volume of automotive plastics was approximately 360,072 MT, representing a decrease of 18.8% compared to that in 2018, primarily because the overall weakening in macroeconomic conditions since summer of 2018, though our sales in Northeast, South, Central, and North China has grown. We also had overseas sales of US$61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to US$15.0 million in prior year.
 
We believe our leading market position allows us to successfully compete with other foreign and domestic modified plastic manufacturers in the market. Being one of the leading specialized manufacturers of automotive modified plastics in China, we believe we are well-positioned to not only grow with the increasing market demand but increase market share by replacing smaller and less efficient modified plastic manufacturer.

In addition, as a result of our consistent research and development efforts, we had 633 product certifications from major automotive manufacturers in the PRC as of December 31, 2019, which we believe is among the largest numbers of product certifications by any domestic player in China's automotive plastics industry. Strict certification requirements and long certification periods result in high barriers to entry. Our current or potential competitors are required to obtain relevant product certifications from automotive manufacturers in order to compete with us. Each certification normally takes over two years to complete, and as a result, automotive manufacturers are reluctant to replace suppliers like us who have already received necessary certifications and proven consistent product quality. We believe that having one of the largest portfolios of product certifications in China allows us to strengthen our competitive position.

● | Established Distribution Model. Through twelve distributors across China, we have established distribution networks that cover Northeast, North, Southwest and East China, with a current focus on Northeast China. We enter into distribution agreements with local distributors in areas where large automobile manufacturers are located. By leveraging the proximity of our distributors to the automobile manufacturers, we can enhance our relationships with our customers. Through the established sales channels, we can quickly respond to local market demand, address customer needs, enhance our ability to provide superior technological support and after-sales services, and lower our marketing expenses. At the same time, our distributors are responsible for the payments to us which is not contingent upon their cash collection from end customers. By actively managing our distribution network, we are also able to accelerate local market penetration and increase sales opportunities. For example, we entered the north China market in 2009 through a local distributor, one year earlier than we planned, and in 2013, we entered into the Southwest China market, and in 2014, we entered into South China and Central China market. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Northeast, East, North, Southwest, Central and South accounted for approximately 32.2%, 26.4%, 15.7%, 9.2%, 6.3% and 6.0% of our revenues, respectively.

Our Strategies
 Our goal is to capitalize on China's modified plastics growth trend, with a specific focus on applications in the auto sector, and to eventually be the leading modified plastics manufacturer in China. We are committed to enhancing our sales and profitability and achieving our goals through the following strategies:
 
●        Continue to Expand/Upgrade Production Capacity.  Over the past five years, we have consistently increased production capacity to meet the rising demands of the automotive industry in the PRC. As of December 31, 2019, we have an installed annual production capacity of 394,200 metric tons in domestic production bases, and we have been operating at near full capacity since 2007. With the expected strong growth in the automotive modified plastics market of China, we expect that we will continue to experience strong demand from our customers. Therefore, we intend to continue to strategically increase our production capacity to meet customer demands from both expanded geographical locations and future downstream sector growth. In 2013, we commenced to construct our fourth production base with 300,000 MT new material production capacity and the affiliated research and development center and training center in Nanchong City of Sichuan Province (the "Project").  We installed 50 production lines with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant and additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there was still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
 
The Company completed and started the trial production in the plant in Dubai, UAE with additional 2,500 metric tons targeting high-end products for the overseas markets.   The Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018. As of December 31, 2019, an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity mainly targeted for ABS products, were still in the progress of redesigning upgrading and further equipment testing. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, then, bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.
 
Since 2013, the HLJ Xinda Group had approximately 390,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 88 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In July 2017, the HLJ Xinda Group launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics, which we expect to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2020. The reason for such delay is due to additional time for equipment’s installation and test.  In 2019, HLJ Xinda Group started another two equipment projects totaling 155,000 MT in Qinling Road Factory (“Qinling Road Project”) and Jiangnan Road Factory (“Jiangnan Road Project”) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which is expected be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020. Also included is an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory, all of which we expect to be completed by the end of 2023.
 
●          Focus on R&D and Develop New Product Offerings.  We are currently utilizing our R&D capabilities to obtain further product certifications, develop new products, applications and technologies. Approximately 90% of our automotive plastics product certification applications are currently undergoing trial manufacturing periods to obtain the necessary certifications. In addition, we are developing new products for automotive applications to expand our product portfolio, including initiating R&D on modified plastic for use in electric vehicles. We also have increased efforts directed towards applications in new electrical equipment and electronics, alternative energy applications, power devices, aviation equipment and ocean engineering, in addition to other new products primarily for advanced industrialized applications in the automobile sector and in new verticals such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, 3D printing materials, biodegradable plastics, and medical devices. We are the first non-State-Owned-Enterprise awarded National Level Enterprise Technology Center, in Heilongjiang Province. In addition, we have Postdoctoral and Academy Member Workstation in Heilongjiang Province enhancing our research and development capabilities.

●          Expand Customer Base Domestically and Internationally.  The automotive plastics market in the PRC is highly fragmented with significant barriers to entry. In 2016, we had 8.0% of the market share with our customer coverage was originally concentrated in the northeast regions of the PRC. We seek to steadily enhance our market share in Northeast China, and also expand our reach to East China, Central China, Southwest China and South China. In addition, we have conducted sales in overseas markets and exported our products including non-auto sectors since 2014.  In 2018, we had 8.0% of the market share, ranking the second in terms of sales volume of automotive modified plastics in China. We plan to implement such strategies through further expanding our distribution network by working with local distributors who have contacts and networks overseas and directly establishing strategic alliances with certain of our non-PRC customers. Although the entry barrier of some non-auto sectors might not generally be as high as that of the auto sector, our focus is to target high-value-added products by leveraging our technology, expertise and know-how accumulated in the auto sector over the course of our operational history.
 
●         Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions.  While we have experienced substantial organic growth, we plan to pursue a disciplined and targeted acquisition strategy to accelerate our growth. Our strategy will focus on strengthening presence in certain geographies, improving our penetration in attractive markets, enhancing research and development capabilities and acquiring new markets or customers.
 
●          Increase Efficiency by Corporate Restructuring. We completed our corporate restructuring plan at the end of 2014 and further optimized our management structure and enhancing efficiency in 2018, with the aim of establishing a more efficient company group structure, as a result of which our subsidiaries are more easily accessible to our end customers and our operations are able to respond to the market changes in a more efficient manner.
