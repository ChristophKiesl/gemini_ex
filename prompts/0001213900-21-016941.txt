Agreement and Plan of Merger
 
On April 20, 2020, the Company, Fresh Market Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a newly created wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, also referred to herein as Merger Sub, and Home Bistro, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation engaged in the food preparation and home-delivery business (presently known as Home Bistro Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation), also referred to herein also Home Bistro Holdings, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, also referred to herein as the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub agreed to merge with and into Home Bistro Holdings, with Home Bistro Holdings becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation in the merger, also referred to herein as the Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Home Bistro Holdings filed a Certificate of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 20, 2020.
 
Prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Company and certain of its existing securityholders entered into an Exchange Agreement providing for, among other things, the exchange (the “Exchange”) of securities held by such securityholders for shares of common stock, as more fully detailed therein. As a result of the Exchange, all of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and convertible notes were converted into an aggregate of 5,405,479 shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, consisting of 1,364,222 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 4,041,258 shares of common stock. The 250,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock owned by a former officer were cancelled on April 9, 2020 pursuant to a General Release Agreement and 250,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by a related party remained issued and outstanding as of the date of the Merger.
 
After the Exchange, a total of 1,899,094 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 4,041,258 shares of common stock and 60,638 stock options were deemed issued and outstanding.
 
At the effective time of the Merger, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock of Home Bistro Holdings was converted into the right to receive approximately four hundred seventy-three (473) shares of common stock. Accordingly, the aggregate shares of the Company’s common stock issued in the Merger to the former securityholders of Home Bistro Holdings is 24,031,453 shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis consisting of 17,105,139 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 6,926,314 shares of common stock.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, the Company had an aggregate of 30,031,501 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis consisting of 19,004,233 shares of common stock, 60,638 stock options and warrants to purchase up to 10,967,572 shares of common stock.
 
On April 20, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Roy G. Warren, Jr., Mike Edwards, and Bruce Zanca resigned as directors of the Company and Roy G. Warren, Jr. resigned as Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The resignations were not the result of any disagreement related to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Furthermore, on April 20, 2020, Mr. Zalmi Duchman, the Chief Executive Officer of Home Bistro Holdings, Michael Finkelstein and Michael Novielli were appointed as directors of the Company. In addition, Mr. Duchman was appointed Chief Executive Officer.


In connection with the Merger, certain Company stockholders entered into a Lock-Up and Leak-Out Agreement with the Company pursuant to which, among other thing, such stockholders agreed to certain restrictions regarding the resale of common stock for a period of two years from the date of the Merger Agreement, as more fully detailed therein.

Additionally, on April 20, 2020, the Company and a stockholder entered into a Put Option Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed, at the election of the stockholder, to purchase certain shares of common stock from such stockholder no sooner than two years from the date of the Put Option Agreement (the “Market Period”). Pursuant to the Put Option Agreement, in the event that the stockholder does not generate $1.3 million dollars (the “Total Investment”) in gross proceeds from the sale of its shares of common stock by the second anniversary of the Put Option Agreement, then the stockholder has the right to cause the Company to purchase shares held by the stockholder at a price equal to the difference between the Total Investment and the net proceeds actually realized by the stockholder from shares of common stock sold during the Market Period and the number of shares of common stock held by the stockholder on the date the put right is exercised. The put right expires fourteen (14) days from end of the Market Period. In connection with the Put Option Agreement, the Company recorded a common stock repurchase obligation in the amount of $1.3 million.
 
Effective April 20, 2020, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Home Bistro Holdings pursuant to the Merger Agreement and Home Bistro Holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, for financial statement reporting purposes, the Merger between the Company and Home Bistro Holdings has been treated as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization with Home Bistro Holdings deemed the accounting acquirer and the Company deemed the accounting acquiree in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Section 805-10-55. At the time of the Merger, both the Company and Home Bistro Holdings had their own separate operating segments. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements after the Merger are those of Home Bistro Holdings and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Home Bistro Holdings. The acquisition process utilizes the capital structure of the Company and the assets and liabilities of Home Bistro Holdings which are recorded at historical cost. The results of operations of the Company are consolidated with results of operations of Home Bistro Holdings starting on the date of the Merger Agreement. The equity of the consolidated entity is the historical equity of Home Bistro Holdings retroactively restated to reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the reverse acquisition.
 
The Merger constituted a change of control and the majority of the Board of Directors changed with the consummation of the Merger. The Company issued to the stockholders of Home Bistro Holdings shares of common stock and stock warrants which represented approximately 80% of the combined company on a fully converted basis after the closing of the Merger. As a result of the above transactions and the Company’s intent to dispose of or divest the assets and liabilities associated with the RTD Business as discussed below, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization of Home Bistro Holdings where Home Bistro Holdings is considered the historical registrant and the historical operations presented will be those of Home Bistro Holdings.
 
The following assets and liabilities were assumed in the Merger:
 

Cash | $ | 4,917 | 
--------------------------------------+---+----------+--
Prepaid expense | | 9,776 | 
Operating right-of-use asset | | 32,444 |

Net liability assumed | $ | (194,724 | )

 
Disposal of Discontinued Operations of the RTD Business
 
On September 25, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, among other things, the Company agreed to sell all of the Company’s business, assets and properties used, or held or developed for use, in its functional RTD (Ready to Drink) beverage segment (the “RTD Business”), and the Buyer agreed to assume certain debts, obligations and liabilities related to the RTD Business. The Company assumed an accounts payable liability in the amount of $14,000 related to accounting expense of the RTD Business for a period prior to the Merger. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer reimbursed the Company for t accounting expenses in amount of $14,000 incurred prior to the Merger, of which $7,000 was payable in cash and the balance in form of a promissory note dated September 25, 2020 in the amount of $7,000. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 5% per annum, matures on April 25, 2021 and is payable in monthly installments of $1,000 commencing on October 25, 2020 through April 25, 2021. The Company received the $7,000 cash portion of the consideration subsequent to September 30, 2020 which has been included in the prepaid and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2020 (see Note 1). The $14,000 reimbursement was recorded to additional paid in capital as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ deficit.
 
ASC 205-20 “Discontinued Operations” establishes that the disposal or abandonment of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity should be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. As a result, the component’s results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. The results of operations of this component, for all periods, are separately reported as “discontinued operations” on the consolidated statements of operations.
 
The Asset Purchase Agreement, discussed above under Agreement and Plan of Merger, was intended to be part of the Merger and in effect transferred the RTD Business and the related assets and liabilities to Gratitude Keto, whose CEO, Roy Warren Jr., formerly served as the Company’s director and Chief Operating Officer and was considered a related party, in substance, in the accounting of this transaction. Therefore, the disposal of net liabilities and the reimbursement discussed above in connection with the disposal of the RTD Business was recorded to additional paid in capital as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ deficit.

The Products and Packaging:
 
The Company manufactures, packages, and sells, direct-to-consumer, gourmet meals under the Home Bistro brand and markets restaurant quality meats and seafood under the Prime Chop and Colorado Prime brands. The Company’s meals are freshly prepared, flash-frozen, to preserve freshness, and packaged in its facility located in Miami, Florida. Home Bistro meals are ordered on-line and delivered to consumers in containers designed to keep the products frozen during transport. Once delivered, the meals can be heated using a microware cooker or hot water for consumption within minutes and with little to no preparation and minimal cleanup.
 
In addition to its diverse menu of gourmet meals, the Company has also partnered with world-renowned chefs to offer a selection of each chef’s specialty cuisine (the “Celebrity Chef Program”). The Company launched its Celebrity Chef Program with Iron Chef, Cat Cora to offer Chef Cora’s Mediterranean/Southern inspired cooking. Home Bistro also partnered with “Hungry Fan” celebrity chef, Daina Falk to offer Ms. Falk’s sports stadium tailgate inspired recipes. The Company plans to expand it celebrity chef program to include gourmet cuisine from notable chefs around the world. In doing so, the Company intends to create a digital food court through which it will offer consumers an internationally diversified selection of fully cooked gourmet meals.


Market Information and the Value Chain and Routes to Market
 
The online food delivery market is projected to reach $28.5 billion in the United States in 2021 and achieve a cumulative average growth rate of 4.3% through 2024, according to a recent report by market and consumer data company Statista.
 
Consumers are continually becoming time-starved and convenience-seeking, while others have tired from the impact the pandemic has had on their access to restaurant quality food over the last year. As a result, consumers have aggressively sought out alternatives to cooking at home or ordering take-out.


Meal-Kits vs. Third-Party Delivery vs. Prepared Meals
 
Business models for meal-kit providers, third-party delivery services and prepared “heat-to-eat” meal companies, differ vastly from one another. Meal-kit companies provide customers pre-portioned, raw ingredients and recipes that require preparation, cooking, and the ensuing clean-up, not to mention that the resulting meal is still subject to the preparer’s ability, or lack thereof, to cook. On average, meals take anywhere from 30-60 minutes for preparation and cooking and another 15 minutes to clean up. In addition, due to the short shelf life of raw materials provided in meal-kits, meal-kit providers experience higher operating and supply chain costs compared to prepared meal providers. Home Bistro’s flash freezing process and packaging serves to extend its product’s shelf life and promotes operational efficiencies.
 
Third-party online delivery platforms such as Grubhub, Uber Eats and DoorDash offer access to restaurants’ menus via a single online portal. Customers then order directly from the app and cooked meals are delivered typically within 60 minutes by the restaurant, third party delivery service or the app platform itself. During the delivery, cooked meals lose heat, which can decrease the enjoyment of the meal or require reheating.
 
The prepared, heat-to-eat providers in the meal delivery segment (in which Home Bistro operates) ship fresh and fresh-frozen, fully cooked meals direct-to-consumer. On average, these meals require heating for only three to five minutes using a microwave of sous vide machine. The experience is extremely convenient, requires very little cleanup and delivers a gourmet meal prepared by a professional chef. Consumers can order one meal or several meals, which can be stored and heated when desired.

Production
 
Until mid-2020, the Company used third-party co-packers to cooks, packages, fulfill and ship its meals to its customers. In June, Home Bistro entered into a lease for commercial kitchen facilities, hired and trained professional chefs and implemented its own fulfillment operations. By managing its own food production and fulfillment, Home Bistro expects to be able to improve its competitive position, while expanding its gross profit and operating margins. It will provide the Company with significantly greater flexibility to create and introduce new menu items, including the expansion of its Celebrity Chef Program, and react to dynamics of a developing marketplace.
 
Orders for restaurant quality meats and seafood through the Company’s Prime Chop and Colorado Prime brands continue to be processed through a third-party co-packer based in North Carolina who fulfills and ships customer orders.
 
Competition
 
In the direct-to-consumer prepared meal home delivery market segment, our competition is extensive and includes larger more established companies such as Jenny Craig, WW International and Nutrisystem which have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than the Company, as well as numerous smaller independent providers. We believe, however, there is considerable room for additional competitors offering modestly priced, high quality offerings, as the direct-to-consumer segment of the home delivery market for food continues to expand. In addition, we believe the competition for consumers seeking ready-made gourmet meals (such as Home Bistro) is less intensive than other niches such as weight loss, high protein, keto, or paleo.
 
In the direct-to-consumer, high quality meats and seafood market segment, our competition is extensive and includes larger more established companies such as Omaha Steaks, Kansas City Steak Company and Snake River Farms which have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than the Company, as well as Butcher Block, D’Artagnan and Crowd Cow. We believe, however, there is considerable room for additional competitors offering modestly priced, high quality offerings, as the direct-to-consumer segment of the home delivery market for food continues to expand.
 
Home Bistro’s online competition consists primarily of national and local service providers, point-of-sale module vendors that serve some independent restaurants who have their own standalone websites and the online interfaces of restaurants that also offer takeout. The Company also competes for diners with online competitors on the basis of convenience, control, and customer care. For restaurants, Home Bistro competes with other online platforms based on its ability to generate additional orders, manage challenges such as customization, change orders, menu updates and specials and the ability to help them improve their operational efficiency.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We will employ a number of external resources to assist us in complying with our regulatory obligations. These external resources will include outside technology providers and consultants. As we expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to cover the expected increase in costs to hire and train additional internal and external resources to ensure we remain in substantial compliance with our governmental obligations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Trademarks
 
We own trademarks on certain of our products, including Trademark serial numbers 86636971 and 86636968.


Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Home Bistro had 5 full-time employees. None of these employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements and the Company considers it relations with its employees to be good.
