ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (“CPRL”), together with its subsidiaries (“CP” or the “Company”), owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States (“U.S.”). CP's diverse business mix includes bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic over a network of approximately 12,400 miles, serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montreal, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia ("B.C."), and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. For additional information regarding CP's network and geographical locations, refer to Item 2. Properties. 
CPRL was incorporated on June 22, 2001, under the Canada Business Corporations Act and controls and owns all of the Common Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (“CPRC”), which was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of Canada. The Company’s registered, executive and corporate head office is located at 7550 Ogden Dale Road S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9. CP's Common Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CP”.
For purposes of this report, all references herein to “CP,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to CPRL, CPRL and its subsidiaries, CPRL and one or more of its subsidiaries, or one or more of CPRL's subsidiaries, as the context may require. All references to currency amounts included in this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, are in Canadian dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.
Strategy
CP is driving change as it moves through its transformational journey to become the best railroad in North America while creating long-term value for shareholders. The Company is focused on providing customers with industry-leading rail service; driving sustainable, profitable growth; optimizing its assets; and reducing costs while remaining a leader in rail safety. Looking forward, CP continues to execute its strategic plan, focusing on turning productivity into service, and service into revenue growth.
CP’s strategic plan is centred on five key foundations, which are the Company’s performance drivers.
Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company’s customers. “Doing what we say we are going to do” is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making.  
Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success. 
Optimize Assets: Through longer sidings, improved asset utilization and increased train lengths, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.  
Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. Continuous research and development in state-of-the-art safety technology and highly focused employees ensure our trains are built for safe, efficient operations across our network.
Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company is shaping a new culture focused on a passion for service with integrity in everything it does. Coaching and mentoring managers into becoming leaders will help drive CP forward.
Business Developments
During the third quarter of 2016, the Company and Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. ("Pershing Square") completed a public offering of 9,840,890 of CP Common Shares held by certain funds managed by Pershing Square. CP did not sell any common shares in the offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the offering of common shares by the funds managed by Pershing Square. After the closing of the sale, funds managed by Pershing Square no longer own any common shares of CP.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, CP proposed a business combination with Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”). While CP was firmly of the view that a business combination would deliver improved levels of service to customers and communities while enhancing competition and creating significant shareholder value, NS rejected CP’s proposal. On February 9, 2016, CP notified NS of its intent to submit a resolution to NS shareholders to ask their Board of Directors to engage in good faith discussions with CP regarding a business combination transaction involving CP and NS that would create a true end-to-end transcontinental railroad that would enhance competition, benefit the public and drive economic growth. However, on April 11, 2016, CP announced that it had terminated 
4

efforts to merge with NS, including the withdrawal of a resolution asking NS shareholders to vote in favour of good-faith negotiations between the two companies. No further financial offers or overtures to meet with the NS board of directors are planned at this time.

Operations
The Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by business line, the overall financial and operational performance of the Company is analyzed as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. Additional information regarding the Company's business and operations, including revenue and financial information, and information by geographic location is presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 25 Segmented and geographic information.
Lines of Business
The Company transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. Bulk commodities include grain, coal, potash, fertilizers and sulphur. Merchandise freight consists of finished vehicles and machinery, as well as forest and industrial and consumer products. Intermodal traffic consists largely of retail goods in overseas containers that can be transported by train, ship and truck and in domestic containers and trailers that can be moved by train and truck.

The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Bulk freight revenues by commodity business in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
6

Canadian Grain
The Company’s Canadian grain business represented approximately 36% of Bulk revenues, which is 16% of total freight revenues in 2016.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Canadian grain freight revenues generated from regulated grain and non-regulated grain transportation in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
Canadian grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, corn, soybeans and canola, and processed products such as meals, oils and flour. This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver in British Columbia (B.C.), and east to the Port of Thunder Bay in Ontario for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., to Mexico, and to eastern Canada for domestic consumption.
Canadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the Canada Transportation Act (“CTA”). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (“MRE”). Under this regulation, railroads can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railroad based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
U.S. Grain
The Company’s U.S. grain business represented approximately 19% of Bulk revenues, which is 8% of total freight revenues in 2016.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's U.S. grain freight revenues generated from wheat, soybeans, corn, durum, and other processed products in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
U.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, soybeans, corn, durum, and processed products such as meals, oils and flour. This business is centred in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. Export grain traffic from this producing region is shipped to ports at Duluth and Superior in Minnesota. In partnership with other railroads, CP also moves grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Grain destined for domestic consumption

Independently, these producers move domestic potash with CP primarily to the U.S. Midwest for local application.
8

Fertilizers and Sulphur
The Company's Fertilizers and sulphur business represented approximately 11% of Bulk revenues, which is 4% of total freight revenues in 2016.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Fertilizers and sulphur freight revenues generated from wet fertilizers, dry fertilizers, and sulphur transportation in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
Dry fertilizers include: urea, nitrogen solutions, phosphate rock, phosphate fertilizers, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate; wet fertilizers are primarily anhydrous ammonia. Nitrogen fertilizers (dry and wet) are produced at major facilities in Western Canada and shipped within Western Canada and to U.S. Midwest destinations. Phosphate fertilizers are produced in Western Canada or transported from the U.S.
Most sulphur is produced in Alberta as a byproduct of processing sour natural gas, refining crude oil and upgrading bitumen produced in the Alberta oil sands. Sulphur is a raw material used primarily in the manufacturing of sulphuric acid, which is used most extensively in the production of phosphate fertilizers. Sulphuric acid is also a key ingredient in industrial processes ranging from smelting and nickel leaching to paper production.
MERCHANDISE
The Company’s Merchandise business represented approximately 34% of total freight revenues in 2016.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Merchandise freight revenue by commodity business in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
Merchandise products move in trains of mixed freight and in a variety of car types. Service involves delivering products to many different customers and destinations. In addition to traditional rail service, CP moves merchandise traffic through a network of truck-rail transload facilities, expanding the reach of CP's network to non-rail served facilities.
9

Forest Products
The Company’s Forest products business represented approximately 13% of Merchandise revenues, which is 5% of total freight revenues in 2016.

Energy consists of commodities such as ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”), gasoline, diesel, condensate, asphalt, and lubricant oils. The majority of the Company’s western Canadian energy traffic originates in Saskatchewan and in the Alberta Industrial Heartland, Canada’s largest hydrocarbon processing region. The Bakken formation region in Saskatchewan and North Dakota is another source of condensate, LPG and natural gas liquids. Interchange with several rail interline partners gives the Company access to refineries and export facilities in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast U.S. and the Gulf Coast, as well as the Texas and Louisiana petrochemical corridor and port connections.
CP's biofuels traffic originates mainly from facilities in the U.S. Midwest, shipping to destinations in the northeastern U.S. 
10

The Company’s chemical traffic includes products such as ethylene glycol, styrene, sulphuric acid, methanol, sodium chlorate, caustic soda and soda ash. These shipments originate from eastern Canada, Alberta, the U.S. Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico and move to end markets in Canada, the U.S. and overseas.
The most commonly shipped plastics products are polyethylene and polypropylene. Almost half of the Company’s plastics originate in central and northern Alberta and move to various North American destinations.
Crude
The Company's Crude business represented approximately 7% of Merchandise revenues, which is 2% of total freight revenues in 2016.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Crude freight revenues generated from Canadian and U.S. shipments in 2016, 2015 and 2014:

Sand and stone, and cement are the dominant aggregates. Frac sand, within sand and stone, originates at mines located along the Company’s network in Wisconsin and moves to a diverse set of shale formations across North America. The majority of the Company’s cement traffic is shipped directly from production facilities in Alberta, Iowa and Ontario to energy and construction projects in North Dakota, Alberta, Manitoba and the U.S. Midwest.
CP transports steel in various forms from mills in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Iowa to a variety of industrial users. The Company carries base metals such as copper, lead, zinc and aluminum. CP also moves ores from mines to smelters and refineries for processing, and the processed metal to automobile and consumer products manufacturers.
Consumer products traffic consists of a diverse mix of goods, including food products, building materials, packaging products and waste products.
Automotive
The Company’s Automotive business represented approximately 17% of Merchandise revenues, which is 6% of total freight revenues in 2016.

13

The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's International intermodal freight revenues generated from the Port of Vancouver, the Port of Montreal and other ports in 2016, 2015 and 2014:
CP’s International intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver, Montreal and New York and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. CP works closely with the Port of Montreal, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in Canada and the U.S. Midwest. The Company’s U.S. Northeast service connects eastern Canada with the Port of New York, offering a competitive alternative to trucks.
Fuel Cost Adjustment Program
The short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On Highway Diesel; as such, fuel surcharge revenue is a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 2% of the Company's total freight revenues in 2016.
Non-freight Revenues
Non-freight revenues accounted for approximately 3% of the Company’s total revenues in 2016. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets, switching fees, and other arrangements, including logistical services and contracts with passenger service operators.
Significant Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer comprised more than 10% of total revenues or accounts receivable.
Competition
The Company is subject to competition from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Price is only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transportation service provider. Service is another factor and requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation. CP’s primary rail competitors are Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in Canada, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, including its primary subsidiary BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in the U.S. Midwest. Other railways also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.
Seasonality
Volumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Great Lakes ports and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve over the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs and increased demand for 
14

retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions. Net income is also influenced by seasonal fluctuations in customer demand and weather-related issues.
Regulations
Government Regulation
The Company’s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed. 
Operations are subject to economic and safety regulation in Canada primarily by the Canadian Transportation Agency (“the Agency”), Transport Canada, the CTA and the Railway Safety Act (“RSA”). The CTA provides shipper rate and service remedies, including final offer arbitration, competitive line rates and compulsory inter-switching in Canada. The Agency regulates the MRE for the movement of export grain, commuter and passenger access, charges for ancillary services, and noise-related disputes. Transport Canada regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada.
The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to economic and safety regulation by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) and the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”). The STB is an economic regulatory body with jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and reviewing proposed railroad mergers and other transactions. The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company’s railway operations in the U.S. under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. 
Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company’s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental and other matters. 
Regulatory Change 
On May 29, 2014, the Government of Canada enacted the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act (the “Fair Rail Act”). This legislation authorizes the federal cabinet to require the Company and CN to move a minimum amount of grain, which amount is determined by and may be adjusted by the federal cabinet. There is currently no minimum grain volume required by the federal cabinet. In addition, the Fair Rail Act expands the terms and conditions associated with the inter-switching provisions of the CTA in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provides that the Agency make regulations specifying what constitutes operational terms that may be subject to service agreement arbitration, and gives the Agency the power to order a railway to compensate any person who has incurred expenses because of a failure to meet obligations under Sections 113 and 114 of the CTA, or does not meet its obligations under the terms of a confidential contract that includes a compensation clause. Further, the Fair Rail Act amends the Canada Grain Act to permit the regulation of contracts relating to grain and the arbitration of disputes respecting the provisions of those contracts. 
After the tragic accident in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, in July of 2013 involving a non-related short-line railroad, the Government of Canada implemented several measures pursuant to the Rail Safety Act (Canada) and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (Canada). These modifications implemented changes with respect to rules associated with securing unattended trains; the classification of crude being imported, handled, offered for transport or transported; and the provision of information to municipalities through which dangerous goods are transported by rail. The U.S. federal government has taken similar actions. These changes did not have a material impact on CP’s operating practices. 
On February 20, 2015, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-52 “An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act”, which received Royal Assent on June 18, 2015, and is now in force. Bill C-52 sets out new minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on: amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards/poisonous inhalation hazards moved; imposes strict liability; limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level; mandates the creation of a fund of $250 million paid for by a levy on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond $1 billion (in respect of CP); allows railways and insurers to have existing rights to pursue other parties (subrogation); and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement. It is too soon for the Company to determine the impact that these amendments to the CTA and the RSA will have on the Company’s financial condition and results from operations. 
On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Transportation Secretary announced the final rule for a new rail tank car standard for flammable liquids and the retrofitting schedule for older tank cars used to transport flammable liquids. The development of the new tank car standard was done in coordination between Transport Canada, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and the FRA. This announcement was followed by publishing the new tank car standard in Canada on May 20, 2015. The new tank car standards require new tanks used to move flammable liquids to have: top-fitting protection; thermal protection including a jacket; the use of 9/16 inch normalized steel for the tank car; full head shield; and improved bottom outlet valves. In the U.S., the new standards also included new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids such as the use of electronically controlled pneumatic (“ECP”) brakes for trains carrying 70 or more cars of flammable liquids, routing requirements, speed restrictions, and information for local government agencies. The U.S. rule also provides new sampling and testing requirements for the classification of energy products placed into transport. In Canada, operational protocols such as speed restrictions to 40 miles per hour in census metropolitan areas, crude sampling and testing requirements, and sharing information with municipal first 
15

responders, had previously been implemented. CP does not own any tank cars used for commercial transportation of hazardous commodities.
On October 29, 2015, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 was signed into law. The law extends, by three years, the deadline for the U.S. rail industry to implement Positive Train Control (“PTC”), a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and other accidents caused by human error by determining the precise location, direction and speed of trains, warning train operators of potential problems, and taking immediate action if an operator does not respond. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008 mandated that PTC systems be put into service by the end of 2015 on rail lines used to transport passengers or toxic-by-inhalation materials. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 extended the deadline to install and activate PTC to December 31, 2018, or, December 31, 2020 under certain circumstances, allowing the Company additional time to ensure safe and effective implementation of PTC on its rail network.
For further details on the capital expenditures associated with compliance with the PTC regulatory mandate, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
On December 4, 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act was signed into law, representing the first long-term transportation legislation enacted in the U.S. in over a decade. The FAST Act contains key provisions on safety enhancements for tank cars moving flammable liquids in the U.S. and ECP train braking. Among those key provisions, the FAST Act requires new tank cars to be equipped with thermal blankets, requires all legacy DOT-111 tank cars moving flammable liquids to be upgraded to new retrofit standards (regardless of how many cars may be in a train), and sets minimum requirements for protection of certain valves. While the law preserves PHMSA’s May 2015 final rule mandating ECP brakes on certain trains, it requires an independent evaluation of this braking technology and a real-world derailment test. The FAST Act further calls for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to re-evaluate its ECP final rule within the next year using the results of this evaluation to determine whether ECP braking system requirements are justified.
Finally, the STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 was signed into law on December 18, 2015. The law requires numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the Department of Transportation and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board’s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes. It is too soon for the Company to anticipate the impact that these changes and new investigative authorities might have on CP, since no arbitrations or, to CP's knowledge, investigations have been initiated under recently adopted rules implementing these laws.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company’s operating results and reputation.
The Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. CP's Annual Corporate Operations Environmental Plan states the current environmental goals, objectives and strategies.
Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as air emissions, wastewater, management of vegetation, chemicals and waste, storage tanks and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established Strategic Emergency Response Contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested.
The Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically and regularly assesses the Company’s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company’s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and semi-annual review by senior management.

Security
CP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Regulations by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially toxic inhalation hazard (“TIH”) materials. Legislative changes in Canada to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act are expected to add new security regulatory requirements similar to those in the U.S. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company’s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operating results.

CP takes the following security measures:


• | CP employs its own police service that works closely with communities and other law enforcement and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services are headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operate on the CP rail network as well as in areas where CP has non-railway operations.


• | CP’s Police Communication Centre (“PCC”) operates 24 hours a day. The PCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials, and ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies.


• | CP’s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modelled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001. Under this plan, CP routinely examines and prioritizes railroad assets, physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and threats, as well as tests and revises measures to provide essential railroad security. To address cyber security risks, CP implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. The Company has also worked diligently to establish backup sites to ensure a seamless transition in the event that the Company's operating systems are the target of a cyber-attack. By doing so, CP is able maintain network fluidity. 


• | CP security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, engagement with our customers and training of emergency responders.
