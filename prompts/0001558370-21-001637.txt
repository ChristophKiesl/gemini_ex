ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
​
History and Organization
​
Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 24, 1998. We are a producer of doré containing gold and silver and metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc.
​
In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. See glossary on page 33 for additional definitions.
​
Our operations in Oaxaca, Mexico are conducted through our Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“DDGM” and “Don David Gold Mine”). The Don David Gold Mine consists of six (6) properties which are all located in what is known as the San Jose structural corridor, which runs 70 degrees northwest. Our properties comprise

​

55 continuous kilometers of this structural corridor which spans three historic mining districts in Oaxaca; the map below shows the general location of our properties:
​
​
Operating Properties:
​
The Aguila project includes the Arista underground mine and processing facility, which commenced operation in 2010, initially from the Aguila open pit mine, followed by development and mining the Arista underground mine. The Arista Mine was expanded in 2016 with the development of the Switchback vein system. The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the processing facility. The Alta Gracia project includes the Mirador underground mine which began operations in 2017. Most of the production from the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects from 2011 to present has been from the Arista Mine. 
​
The Aguila processing facility produces metal concentrates and doré from ore mined from both the Arista and Mirador Mines. The Aguila and Alta Gracia projects include a total of approximately 29,547 hectares of mining concessions, access roads from a major highway, haul roads, a processing facility, and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, an open pit and underground mines, tailings facilities and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information.

Exploration Prospects:
​
Within the 55-kilometer structural corridor sits a highly prospective ground package. Multiple volcanic domes of various scales, and likely non-vented intrusive domes, dominate the district geology. These volcanogenic features are imposed on a pre-volcanic basement of sedimentary rocks. Gold and silver mineralization in this district is related to the manifestations of this classic volcanogenic system and is considered epithermal in character. We intend to unlock the value of the mine, existing infrastructure, and our large property position by continuing to invest in exploration and development and advance organic growth.

We maintain a website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K and is not a part of this report.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) maintains an internet site (www.sec.gov) at which the reports that we file with the SEC are available to review. The SEC site may also be accessed through a link in our website. 
​
2020 Developments
​
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported net income of $4.4 million, including net loss from continuing operations of $6.3 million. The net operating loss from continuing operations includes revenue of $90.7 million and mine gross profit of $12.5 million. Despite the two-month mandatory shut-down in 2020 of the Don David Gold Mine related to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, we achieved solid production results totaling 20,473 gold ounces, 1,189,366 silver ounces, 1,593 copper tonnes, 7,725 lead tonnes and 19,696 zinc tonnes. 
​
In 2020, we realized a full year of benefit from the power grid electricity provided through our power line construction completed in 2019.  The power grid provides significant cost savings for us and access for the first time to electricity to approximately 25,000 homes in the communities in which we operate.
​
Additionally, the paste fill plant, completed in 2019, returned 136,000 tonnes of processing waste to underground workings that would have otherwise been placed in the tailings storage facility.  The paste fill is an effective method of reducing surface tailings and provides structural ground support that allows for more complete mining of mineral reserves. Finally, construction of our dry stack tailings filtration plant progressed and we expect to complete this project by mid-2021. The dry stacked tailings will accelerate reclamation of certain areas of the open-pit mine as well as allowing for efficient storage of tailings.

Sixth consecutive ESR award





For the sixth consecutive year, the Don David Gold Mine earned the prestigious Empresa Socialmente Responsable (“ESR”) award from the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI). Awards are given to organizations who demonstrate a commitment to supporting social and environmental protection programs within their local communities. 
​
We completed thirty-eight underground diamond drill holes totaling 9,471 meters and 7 surface diamond drill holes totaling 3,180 meters at the Aguila project during 2020. Our exploration activities were mainly focused on exploration drilling at the Arista and Switchback vein systems in the Arista Mine. The Switchback vein system extends for over a one kilometer strike length and remains open on both strike and vertical extent. The drill program focused on the Switchback vein system and targeted the expansion and delineation of multiple high-grade parallel veins to define additional mineral reserves and optimize the mine plan. Likewise, we continued to explore extensions of the Arista vein system currently in production. Surface geologic mapping and rock chip sampling also continued in the vicinity of the Arista Mine, the Aguila open pit and the geological targets Cerro Pilon and Cerro Colorado amongst other prospects of the Aguila project. Our exploration efforts demonstrate our commitment to long-term investment in Oaxaca, Mexico.
​
On December 31, 2020, we completed our previously announced spin-off of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortitude Gold Corporation and its subsidiaries, which included the Nevada Mining Unit, into a separate, public company (the “Fortitude Spin-Off”). The separation was completed by way of a pro rata distribution of all the outstanding shares of our newly created subsidiary, Fortitude Gold Corporation, to our shareholders on December 31, 2020. 
​
As a result of the Fortitude Spin-Off, we added a new and highly accomplished CEO, Mr. Allen Palmiere. We have also added three new independent directors, Ms. Lila Manassa Murphy, Mr. Joe Driscoll and Mr. Ron Little, to the Board of Directors.

2021 Guidance
​
 The Company’s focus is on unlocking the value of the mine, existing infrastructure, and large property position and therefore we plan to make significant investments in Oaxaca, Mexico for infrastructure and exploration in 2021. The majority of the exploration work is expected to be spent on drilling and exploration drifts at the Aguila project with the objective to increase our estimate of proven and probable reserves. Metal production is expected to increase slightly over 2020 as we focus on operational excellence and improved operating margins reflected in a reduced cash cost per ounce after by-product credits.

Dividends 
​
During 2020, we paid dividends of $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.
​
​
Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
​
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against most risks that are typical in the operation of our business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.
​
Competitive Business Conditions
​
The acquisition of gold and silver properties is subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Historically, our limited capital and personnel, has put us at a competitive disadvantage compared with many other companies with regard to acquisition, development, and exploration and, if warranted, advancement of mining properties. In 2021, we expect to make a significant investment in exploration activities; however, we believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future.
​
Government Regulations and Permits 
​
In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to Mexican federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The government department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”). SEMARNAT has the broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, including ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust, and noise.
​
For operations at our Don David Gold Mine, we have secured and continue to maintain various regulatory permits from federal, state and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
​
Our operating mines have reclamation plans in place that we believe meet all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, $3.1 million was accrued on our consolidated balance sheet for reclamation costs relating to our operating and exploration properties in Mexico.
​
Customers
​
During the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for 91% of our revenue at DDGM. In the event that our relationship with any of the customers is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to

​



​

locate another entity to purchase our products. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
Following the Fortitude Spin-Off and as of February 24, 2021, we have eleven full-time employees, four of which serve as our executive officers. These individuals devote all of their business time to the Corporation. 
​
We contract for the services of approximately 570 individuals employed by third parties in Mexico and also use various independent contractors for environmental permitting, mining, surface exploration drilling and trucking.
​
We believe we have good moral and a dedicated workforce. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
