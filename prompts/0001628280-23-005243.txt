Item 1.  Business

OVERVIEW

Our award-winning assets include one of the nation's largest portfolios of master planned communities (MPCs) spanning approximately 118,000 gross acres, as well as operating properties, strategic developments, and other unique assets across seven states from New York to Hawai‘i. We create some of the most sought-after communities in the country by curating an environment tailored to meet the needs of our residents and tenants. Our unique business model allows us to drive outsized risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a sharp focus on sustainability to ensure our communities are equipped with the resources to last several decades.
We operate through four business segments: Operating Assets, MPCs, Strategic Developments and Seaport. We create a unique and continuous value-creation cycle through operational and financial synergies associated with our three primary business segments of Operating Assets, MPCs and Strategic Developments. In our MPC segment, we plan, develop and manage small cities and large-scale, mixed-use communities, in markets with strong long-term growth fundamentals. This business focuses on the horizontal development of residential land. The improved acreage is then sold to homebuilders who build and sell homes to new residents. New homeowners create demand for commercial developments, such as retail, office, multi-family and self-storage offerings. We build these commercial properties through Strategic Developments at the appropriate time using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders, which helps mitigate development risk. Once the commercial developments are completed, the assets transition to Operating Assets, which increase recurring Net Operating Income (NOI), further funding our Strategic Developments. New office, retail and other commercial amenities make our MPC residential land more appealing to buyers and increase the velocity of land sales at premiums that typically exceed the broader market. This increased demand for residential land generates more cash flow from MPCs, thus continuing the value-creation cycle. Our fourth business segment, the Seaport, is one of the few multi-block districts largely under private management by a single owner in New York City. This historic waterfront area is being revitalized and enhanced into a mixed-use neighborhood featuring unique culinary and entertainment offerings. 
Our assets are located across the United States with the vast majority of the assets in our Operating Assets segment located within our MPCs. This helps us achieve scale and, in most cases, critical mass, which leads to; pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations; increased ability to attract, hire and retain the best local leadership and leasing teams; flexibility to meet changing customer demands; and enhanced ability to identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our MPCs, including our Floreo (formerly named Trillium) joint venture, span approximately 118,000 gross acres, with approximately 25,000 residential acres of land remaining to be developed and sold in high-demand geographic areas. In addition to the residential land, our MPC segment contains approximately 13,000 acres designated for commercial development or sale to non-competing users such as hospitals. This land is held in our MPC segment until we identify demand for a new commercial development, at which point the land is transitioned into our Strategic Developments segment. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2010. Through our predecessors, we have been in business for several decades. Financial information about each of our segments is presented in Note 18 - Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Our Competitive Strengths

We distinguish ourselves from other real estate companies through the following competitive strengths:
–Track Record of Value Creation. We have completed the development of 7.5 million square feet of office and retail operating properties, 4,637 multi-family units and 909 hospitality keys since 2011. Excluding land which we own, we have invested approximately $3.0 billion in these developments, which is projected to generate a 9.3% yield on cost, a significant spread over market cap rates which, in turn, has generated meaningful value for our shareholders. These investments and returns exclude condominium development as well as projects under construction such as the Seaport. We exclude condominium developments since they do not result in recurring NOI, and we exclude projects under development due to the wider range of NOI they are expected to generate upon stabilization. In Ward Village, we have either opened or have under construction 3,591 condominium units, which have approximately 97.5% units sold as of December 31, 2022.

BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

–Unique, Diverse Portfolio. We own a portfolio with many diverse market-leading assets located across seven states with a combination of steady cash flow and longer-term value creation opportunities.
–Significant Value Creation Opportunity. We have an exceptional development pipeline with over 100 million square feet of vertical entitlements remaining across our portfolio. This represents approximately 13 times the 7.5 million square feet we have delivered in the last twelve years without having to acquire another development site or external asset, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage over other real estate development corporations.
–Flexible Balance Sheet. We ended the year with $626.7 million of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2022, our total debt equaled approximately 49.4% of the book value of our total assets, which we believe is significantly less than our market value. Our net debt, which includes our share of debt of unconsolidated ventures less cash and Special Improvement District (SID) and Municipal Utility District (MUD) receivables, equaled approximately 45.9% of our total enterprise value. Unconsolidated ventures refer to partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the development and operation of real estate assets. Our strong balance sheet provides substantial insulation against potential downturns and provides us with the flexibility to evaluate new real estate project opportunities.
–Self-Funded Business Plan. One of our key differentiators is our ability to self-fund significant portions of our new development without having to dispose of our recently completed developments. Our residential land sales, recurring NOI and profits on the sales of condominium units generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, which is used to fund the equity required to execute our many development opportunities. Furthermore, we are not required to pay dividends nor are we restricted from investing in any asset type, amenity or service, unlike many other real estate companies, which are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT). We believe our structure currently provides us with significant financial and operating flexibility to maximize the value of our real estate portfolio. 

Competition

The nature and extent of our competition depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our Operating Assets segment and our Landlord Operations within the Seaport segment, we primarily compete for retail, office and multi-family tenants. We also compete for residential tenants in our Operating Assets segment. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include: (1) consumer demographics; (2) age, quality, design and location of properties; (3) neighboring real estate projects that have been developed or that we, or others, may develop in the future; (4) diversity of retailers and anchor tenants at shopping center locations; (5) management and operational expertise; and (6) rental rates. The principal factors influencing tenant leasing decisions for our office space include: (1) rental rates; (2) attractive views; (3) amenities; (4) walkable retail; (5) commute time; (6) efficiency of space; and (7) demographics of the available workforce. For residential tenants of our multi-family properties in our Operating Assets segment, we believe the principal factors that impact their decision of where to live are: (1) walkability/proximity to work; (2) amenities; and (3) the best value for their money. 
With respect to our MPC segment, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers primarily in the development of properties within Las Vegas, Nevada; the greater Houston, Texas area; Phoenix, Arizona; and the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. markets. Significant factors that we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include:
–the size and scope of our MPCs
–strong reputation within the industry and years of experience serving our communities
–the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities
–the commercial centers in the communities, including the properties that we own and/or operate or may develop
–our relationships with homebuilders
–our level of debt relative to total assets
–the proximity of our developments to major metropolitan areas
With respect to the Managed Businesses and Events & Sponsorships within our Seaport segment, the restaurant and event industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant or event location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. We compete in the New York area for guests, management and hourly personnel.
HHC 2022 FORM 10-K | 



BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

With respect to our Strategic Developments segment and certain assets subject to development in our Seaport segment, including 250 Water Street, our direct competitors include other commercial property developers and other owners of commercial real estate that engage in similar businesses. With respect to our Strategic Developments segment, we also compete with residential condominium developers. With significant existing entitlements, we hold an advantage over many of our competitors in our markets in that we already own and control, or have significant influence over, substantial acreage for development. We also own the majority of square feet of each product type in many of our markets.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The following further describes our four business segments and provides a general description of the assets comprising these segments. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional details on individual properties, including assets by reportable segment, geographic location and predominant use at December 31, 2022. This section should be referred to when reading Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which contains information about our financial results and operating performance for our business segments.

Operating Assets

We have developed many of the assets in our Operating Assets segment since the Company’s inception in 2010. As of December 31, 2022, we have 75 Operating Assets, including our investments in unconsolidated ventures, consisting of 12 retail properties, 35 office properties, 15 multi-family properties and 13 other operating properties or investments. Excluding our projects under construction, we own approximately 8.8 million square feet of retail and office space and 5,030 multi-family units. 
We believe that the long-term value of our Operating Assets is driven by their concentration in our MPCs where we have a unique level of control and competitive advantage. We believe that these assets have the potential for future growth by increasing rental rates, absorbing remaining vacancy and changing the tenant mix in retail centers to improve gross sales revenue of our tenants, thereby increasing rents. Revenue is primarily generated through rental services and is directly impacted by trends in rental rates and operating costs.
We will also occasionally sell an operating asset when it does not complement our existing properties or no longer fits within our current strategy. In 2022, the Company completed the sale of three retail properties, Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, Lake Woodlands Crossing and Creekside Village Green, as well as the Company’s interest in the 110 North Wacker office property, for total net proceeds of $215.9 million. 
For certain assets, we believe there are opportunities to improve operating performance through redevelopment or repositioning. Redevelopment plans for these assets may include office, retail or residential space, shopping centers, movie theaters, parking complexes or open space. The redevelopment plans may require that we obtain permits, licenses, consents and/or waivers from various parties. These opportunities will require new capital investment and vary in complexity and scale. The redevelopment opportunities range from those that would have minimal disruption to the property to those requiring partial or full demolition of existing structures for new construction. Factors we evaluate in determining whether to redevelop or reposition an asset include the following: (1) existing and forecasted demographics surrounding the property; (2) competition related to existing and/or alternative uses; (3) existing entitlements of the property and our ability to change them; (4) compatibility of the physical site with proposed uses; and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the properties.
HHC 2022 FORM 10-K | 



BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

We generally transfer an operating asset that is being repositioned or redeveloped into our Strategic Developments segment when we close operations at a property and/or begin construction on the redevelopment project. Upon completion of construction or renovation of a development or redevelopment, the asset is fully or partially placed in service and transferred back into our Operating Assets segment.

Master Planned Communities

As of December 31, 2022, we own the MPCs of Summerlin in Las Vegas; The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in the Houston region; Teravalis (formerly named Douglas Ranch) in the Phoenix region; and Columbia in Maryland. Our MPC segment includes the development and sale of residential and commercial land, primarily in large-scale, long-term projects. These developments often require decades of investment and continued focus on the changing market dynamics surrounding these communities. We believe that the long-term value of our MPCs remains strong because of their competitive positioning in their respective markets, our in-depth experience in diverse land use planning and the fact that we have substantially completed the entitlement processes within the majority of our communities.
Our MPCs have won numerous awards for design excellence and for community contribution. Summerlin and Bridgeland were again ranked by Robert Charles Lesser & Co., LLC (RCLCO), capturing ninth and twentieth highest-selling master planned communities in the nation, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We expect the competitive position, desirable locations and land development expertise to drive the long-term growth of our MPCs. As of December 31, 2022, our MPCs, including our Floreo unconsolidated joint venture near Phoenix, Arizona, encompass approximately 118,000 gross acres of land and include approximately 37,000 acres of land available for sale or development. Residential sales, which are generated primarily from the sale of finished lots and undeveloped superpads to residential homebuilders and developers, include standard and custom parcels designated for detached and attached single-family homes, and range from entry-level to luxury homes. Superpad sites are generally 10 to 25-acre parcels of unimproved land where we develop and construct the major utilities (water, sewer and storm drainage) and roads to the borders of the parcel and the homebuilder completes the on-site utilities, roads and finished lots. Revenue is also generated through builder price participation with homebuilders. 
We also occasionally sell or lease land for commercial development when we deem its use will not compete with our existing properties or our development strategy. Commercial sales include land parcels designated for retail, office, hospitality, high-density residential projects (e.g., condominiums and apartments), services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels designated for use by government, schools and other not-for-profit entities.

Seaport

The Seaport spans approximately 473,000 square feet and several city blocks, including Pier 17, the Tin Building, the Historic District and the 250 Water Street development. Our Seaport segment is part non-stabilized operating asset, part development project and part operating business. Due to the range of asset types discussed above, we categorize the businesses in the Seaport segment into the following groups: Landlord Operations, Managed Businesses, the Tin Building and Events and Sponsorships.
Throughout 2022, we have continued to execute on our long-term vision for the Seaport. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company paid $45 million for a 25% interest in Jean-Georges Restaurants, which currently operates over 40 restaurant and hospitality offerings around the world. The Company also paid $10 million in exchange for the option to acquire up to an additional 20% interest in Jean-Georges Restaurants. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company opened the Tin Building, which includes both landlord operations and managed business. The Company owns 100% of the Tin Building which is leased 100% to the Tin Building by Jean-Georges joint venture, a managed business in which the Company has an equity ownership interest.

BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

In October 2020, we announced our comprehensive proposal for the redevelopment of 250 Water Street, which includes the transformation of this underutilized full-block surface parking lot into a mixed-use development that will include affordable and market-rate apartments, community-oriented spaces and office space. This project, which includes approximately 547,000 zoning square feet, presents a unique opportunity at the Seaport to redevelop this site into a vibrant mixed-use asset, provide long-term viability to the South Street Seaport Museum and deliver much-needed affordable housing and economic stimulus to the area. In May 2021, we received approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) on our proposed design for the 250 Water Street site. HHC received final approvals in December 2021 through the New York City Uniform Land Use Review Procedure known as ULURP, which will allow the necessary transfer of development rights to the parking lot site. Also in December 2021, an amendment to the Seaport ground lease was executed giving HHC extension options, at the discretion of HHC, for an additional 48 years from its current expiration in 2072 until 2120. We received a building foundation permit from the New York City Department of Buildings and began initial foundation work and remediation in the second quarter of 2022. Remediation of the site as a volunteer of the New York State Brownfield Cleanup program is expected to be completed in 2023. Various lawsuits have been filed challenging the LPC’s approval of our development project. For additional information regarding these lawsuits, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent and funded by HHC as of December 31, 2022, for the Seaport projects currently under construction, excluding the 250 Water Street development, are $38.9 million. 

Strategic Developments

Our Strategic Developments segment consists of 14 development or redevelopment projects, including developments within our MPCs that will transition to Operating Assets upon completion and condominium towers at Ward Village. Many of these developments require extensive planning and expertise in large-scale and long-range development to maximize their highest and best uses. The strategic process is complex and unique to each asset and requires ongoing assessment of the changing market dynamics prior to the commencement of construction. We must study each local market, determine the highest and best use of the land and necessary improvements to the area, obtain entitlements and permits, complete architectural design and construction drawings, secure tenant commitments and obtain and commit sources of capital.
We are in various stages of predevelopment or execution of our strategic plans for many of these assets based on market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we had six properties under construction and not yet placed into service. We generally obtain construction financing to fund a significant amount of the costs associated with developing these assets. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent on our properties under construction as of December 31, 2022, were $1.1 billion, of which $126.0 million will be funded by HHC and the remaining cost will be funded with existing debt.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)

Our expansive portfolio and tremendous scale give HHC a unique opportunity to build next-generation communities and make a meaningful, positive impact on people’s lives at a local, regional and national level. We are acutely aware of the responsibility that comes along with that opportunity. Building on our reputation for excellence and innovation, we remain focused on making our developments sustainable; giving back to our communities; protecting our landscapes; supporting inclusivity; and establishing communities that create value and well-being for generations to come.
Acknowledging the power of our scale, as well as the opportunities for taking climate action, we are amplifying and accelerating our efforts to further advance resiliency, conservation, innovation, and inclusion throughout our large-scale, mixed-use communities. We have aligned our community strategies to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), defined by the UN as the blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all—a framework that helps us view our people-centric approach to development and management through the global lens of our planet’s most pressing issues.
Our program is overseen by our CEO, President and Board of Directors. Additional details on our sustainable, inclusive and transparent approach are available in our latest ESG annual report now called the HHCommunities Report, which can be found on the Company’s website (https://www.howardhughes.com/our-company/esg). This annual report looks back at the collective efforts of the Howard Hughes team in 2021. It reflects each business segment and region across our national portfolio of Master Planned Communities (MPCs), Strategic Developments, Operating Assets and the Seaport. Our disclosure is in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) 2020 Standards. Prior to this report, the most recent report was published in November 2021 and covered calendar year 2020.

Environmental Strategy and Performance

Our guiding principle that drives the development of our award-winning master planned communities is, ‘How you live, how we build’. Each community manages and addresses its unique context through resilient planning, green building design, high operational performance and ongoing risk management. We continue to monitor and refine our approach as developments transition into operating assets in order to ensure continued support for the responsible use of resources, conservation and efficiency measures. From an operational standpoint, we measure energy, water, emissions and waste performance and proactively pursue efforts to reduce our impact across our portfolio. These efforts align with UN Sustainable Development Goals 6, 7, 12, 13 and 15, all of which focus on climate health and responsible resource stewardship. We complement this holistic approach with programs and actions customized for the age, asset type and regional considerations of our diverse properties. Data-driven analysis, engineering insights and occupant feedback drive unique strategies for each of our buildings.
In 2017, we set 10-year environmentally focused goals for energy use reduction, water use reduction, waste reduction and diversion and carbon emission reduction. We report our progress against the goals annually in our HHCommunities report and leverage industry leadership programs to benchmark environmental performance. Our sustainability report highlighted our management of climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Annually we work with DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc. to externally confirm our energy consumption, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and waste data. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ENERGY STAR and BOMA 360 certifications validate our use of sustainable design, construction and operations principles that result in reduced resource usage, decreased emissions and better well-being for building occupants. We achieved 16 ENERGY STAR certifications, 10 BOMA 360 certifications, 1 LEED certification, 2 LEED precertifications and 10 LEED registered projects, raising our total count to 82 active and pending certifications. The Woodlands, established in 1974, is the largest MPC in the world to receive LEED precertification; the recognition demonstrates HHC’s alignment with sustainability principles for nearly five decades.
In 2022, HHC was recognized by Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) for its sustainability leadership, earning the top ranking in the U.S. Diversified Listed peer group for the 2022 GRESB Real Estate Assessment’s Standing Investments Benchmark. The Company was also recognized as Sector Leader in the Americas Diversified category for its sustainability performance and best practices within the real estate industry. HHC’s first-place peer group ranking was determined by its strong portfolio-wide performance across topics of sustainability, inclusion and transparency. Two key scoring components of the Real Estate Assessment include management and performance. The management component measures an entity’s overall strategy and leadership, approach to stakeholder engagement, and policies and processes. The performance component measures an entity’s environmental and social performance.

Social Strategy and Impact

Human Capital We build vibrant, diverse, and culturally rich communities that deliver an exceptional quality of life for generations to come. Our dedicated and talented team continues the work of the forward-thinking placemakers—James Rouse, George Mitchell, Victoria Ward and Howard Hughes—whose collective legacy of innovation, imagination, and excellence form the basis of our company. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 565 employees supporting our core business, with an additional 175 employed at the Las Vegas Ballpark, including seasonal staff required to support ongoing ballpark events and merchandising operations. 
The continuous development of our employees—at work, and at home—is intrinsically linked to our Company’s ever-evolving creation and stewardship of inclusive, sustainable community living. We encourage continued learning through tuition reimbursement, student debt management resources, and a fund for non-job-related training. To support our employees’ personal well-being, we offer competitive programs for our employees and their families at all stages of life, including a robust health benefits plan, 401k match plan, up to 12 weeks of fully paid leave for parents welcoming new children, financial support of adoption, donation, and surrogacy services, and bicycle reimbursement.
In 2022, HHC continued to build upon our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategies to elevate our overall goals and experiences for our employees and communities. We strive for diversification and retention of talent that ultimately drives top performance, diverse thought, inclusive culture, and leadership development. We invest in processes that help to activate equitable access for employee growth, both personally and professionally. We provide opportunities for all to develop a sense of belonging, fair representation, and engagement through initiatives such as trainings, strategic talent acquisition partnerships, Employee Resource Groups, and annual DEI goals. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was 52% female and 35% ethnically diverse. Employees at a Vice President level or above were 31% female and 19% ethnically diverse. Through multiple initiatives, we continue to find opportunities to increase the diversity of our teams.
In addition to our focus on our employees, we are highly attuned to how we impact the lives of those within our communities, and we support over 350 causes of local charities through monetary donations and volunteerism within our HHCares program. In 2022, the Company donated over $3.9 million nationwide, and matched more than $80,000 of individual employee donations to registered 501c3 non-profit organizations. Our employees also donated upwards of 1,300 hours of volunteer time throughout 2022. 
At Howard Hughes, we recognize that our people are the lifeblood of all we do, and we are committed to supporting them in all aspects of life. We believe better people make better companies, and better companies build better communities.

Governance and Risk Management

In order to identify, monitor, and mitigate potential risks that could impact our organization and investors, The Howard Hughes Corporation has made governance and risk management a top Board priority. As part of our corporate governance framework, we have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that is overseen by the Board’s Risk Committee and led by our Risk Management team. The Risk Committee helps to evaluate the effectiveness of the ERM Program and the performance of the Risk Management team. It also reviews and monitors risks that have been identified and are considered critical by management, such as capital, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory, operational, reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee reviews and approves periodic risk assessment results and reviews risk mitigation activities deemed material by management. The Risk Committee also reviews risk mitigation activities for emerging risks and oversees management’s approach to fostering a risk-intelligent culture.
HHC’s program is shaped and supported by the Board and encompasses a range of corporate governance policies and guidelines that include but are not limited to: Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy, Board Diversity Policy, Cybersecurity Policy, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Officers and Employees, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Insider Trading Policy. These policies and our Human Rights Policy are published on the Company’s website (https://investor.howardhughes.com/documents).

BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements


REGULATORY MATTERS

A portion of our business is dedicated to the development and sale of condominiums. Condominiums are generally regulated by an agency of the state in which they are located or where the condominiums are marketed to be sold. In connection with our development and offering of condominium units for sale, we must submit regulatory filings to various state agencies and engage in an entitlement process by which real property owned under one title is converted into individual units. Responses or comments on our condominium filings may delay our ability to sell condominiums in certain states and other jurisdictions in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, approval to develop real property sometimes requires political support and generally entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the real estate development industry. Our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application.
There is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state and local levels relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. Energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related taxes and regulations. Governmental regulation also affects sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. We may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of remediation of certain hazardous substances, including petroleum and certain toxic substances (collectively hazardous substances) on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous substances. The costs of remediation of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to obtain financing using such real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims.
Additionally, changes to our procedures or additional procedures, implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
