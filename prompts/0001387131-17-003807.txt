ITEM 1. Business
General
 
Richardson Electronics, Ltd. is a leading global provider of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high value flat panel detector solutions, replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and “engineered solutions” based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.
 
Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing, and visual technology solutions. These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical, and communication applications.
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we created a new strategic business unit called Richardson Healthcare (“Healthcare”). As hospitals remain under pressure to reduce costs while serving a much larger customer base, there is a growing demand for independent sources of high-value replacement parts for diagnostic imaging. Having access to parts that are tested and in stock enables hospitals to terminate expensive service contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) and instead use third party service providers or in-house technicians. With our global infrastructure, technical sales team, and experience servicing the healthcare market, we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity. Over time, our plan is to expand our position from being the leader in power grid tubes to a key player in the high-growth, high-profile healthcare industry.
 
Our fiscal year 2017 began on May 29, 2016, and ended on May 27, 2017. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean our fiscal year.

Geography
 
We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America.
 
Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 is set forth in Note 11 “Segment and Geographic Information” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We have three operating and reportable segments, which we define as follows:
 
Power and Microwave Technologies Group
 
Power and Microwave Technologies Group (“PMT”), launched in July 2015, combines Electron Device Group’s (“EDG”) core engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tube business with new RF and power technologies. As a manufacturer and authorized distributor, PMT’s strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics, and aftermarket technical service and repair—all through our existing global infrastructure. PMT’s focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in alternative energy, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific, and semiconductor markets. PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar, and radiation oncology. PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.
 
PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and industrial power applications. Among the suppliers they support are Amperex, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MaCom, National, NJRC, Thales, Toshiba, and Vishay.
 
PMT’s inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintain an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment. PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology. While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share. PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases. As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.
 
PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights which often include global coverage. The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches which are not cured within a reasonable period of time. Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.
 
PMT’s suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers. For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3 “Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including: Amperex®, Cetron®, and National®. Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, and liquid crystal display monitors. The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics, and a wide variety of fabricated metal components. These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.

Canvys
 
Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial, and medical original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) markets. Our engineers design, manufacture, source, and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers. We offer custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, specialized cabinet finishes, and application specific software packages. Our volume commitments are much lower than those of the large display manufacturers, making us the ideal choice for companies with very specific design requirements. We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the high quality liquid crystal displays, mounting devices, and customized computing platforms.
 
We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers including 3M, LG, NEC Displays, and several key Asian display manufacturers that manufacture products to our specifications. We believe supplier relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.
 
Healthcare
 
Healthcare manufactures, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations, and multi-vendor service providers. Products include Diagnostic Imaging replacement parts including CT and MRI tubes, hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; replacement flat panel detectors and upgrades; and additional replacement components currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market. Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings, and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency and deliver better clinical outcomes while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.
Sales and Product Management
 
We have employees, as well as authorized representatives, who are not our employees, selling our products primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.
 
We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as cash in advance and credit card terms. We establish credit limits for each customer and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.
 
Distribution
 
We maintain approximately 110,700 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 90% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day if product is in stock. Customers can access our products on our web sites, www.rell.com, www.rellhealthcare.com, www.canvys.com, and www.rellaser.com, through electronic data interchange, or by telephone. Customer orders are processed by our regional sales offices and supported primarily by one of our distribution facilities in LaFox, Illinois; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Donaueschingen, Germany; or Singapore, Singapore. We also have satellite warehouses in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, China; Bangkok, Thailand; and Hook, United Kingdom. Our data processing network provides on-line, real-time interconnection of all sales offices and central distribution operations, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Information on stock availability, pricing in local currency, cross-reference information, customers, and market analyses are obtainable throughout the entire distribution network.
