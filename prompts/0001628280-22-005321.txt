Item 1.    Business
Our Company
Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Subsidiaries (the “Company” unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires “we,” “us” or “our”) commenced operations in May 2012, focused on investing in, financing and managing a diversified portfolio of real estate related securities, whole loans and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets.  We are externally managed by Western Asset Management Company, LLC (our “Manager”) pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders as long as we maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated a subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, to engage in such activities. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol "WMC."
Our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our stockholders primarily through an attractive dividend, which we intend to support with sustainable distributable earnings (which we previously referred to as core earnings), as well as the potential for higher returns through capital appreciation. Our investment strategy is based on our Manager's perspective of which mix of our target assets it believes provides us with the best risk-reward opportunities at any given time.  We also deploy leverage as part of our investment strategy to increase potential returns. 
Our Manager
We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, an SEC-registered investment advisor and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. (“Franklin”), headquartered in Pasadena, California, that specializes in fixed-income asset management. From offices in Pasadena, Hong Kong, London, Melbourne, New York, São Paulo, Singapore, Tokyo and Zurich, our Manager's 762 employees provide investment services for a wide variety of global clients, including mutual funds, corporate, public, insurance, health care, union organizations and charitable foundations. In addition, two of our directors, James W. Hirschmann III and Bonnie M.Wongtrakool, are also employees of our Manager. Our Manager is responsible for, among other duties: (i) performing all of our day-to-day functions; (ii) determining investment criteria in conjunction with our Board of Directors; (iii) sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings; (iv) performing asset management duties; and (v) performing financial and accounting management. 
Our Competitive Advantages
Our competitive advantages in the marketplace stems from our relationship with our Manager. As of December 31, 2021, our Manager had approximately $492.4 billion in assets under management. Our Manager's scale makes it an important trading partner for many of the largest broker-dealers and banks, which provides our investment team the ability to source real estate related opportunities directly from originators as well as access attractive financing.
Our Investment Strategy

Our Manager’s investment philosophy, which developed from a singular focus in fixed-income asset management over a variety of credit cycles and conditions, is to provide clients with a long-term value-oriented portfolio. We benefit from the breadth and depth of our Manager’s overall investment philosophy, which focuses on a macroeconomic analysis as well as an in-depth analysis of individual assets and their relative value. In making investment decisions on our behalf, our Manager seeks to identify assets across the broad mortgage universe with attractive risk adjusted returns, which incorporates its view on the outlook for the mortgage markets, including relative valuation, supply and demand trends, the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, prepayment rates, financing and liquidity, residential real estate prices, delinquencies, default rates, recovery of various segments of the economy and vintage of collateral, subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.
In December 2021, we announced that our investment strategy will focus on residential real estate related investments, including but not limited to non-qualified mortgage loans, non-agency RMBS, and other related investments. We believe this focus will allow us to address attractive market opportunities while maintaining alignment with our Manager’s core competencies. The portfolio transition is expected to be accomplished over the next 12-18 months. We plan to transition out of the commercial investments in our portfolio, though we may from time to time make commercial investments on an opportunistic basis. 
Our Target Assets
      Residential Whole Loans. — Residential Whole Loans are mortgages secured by single family residences held directly by us or through consolidated trusts with us holding the beneficial interest in the trusts. Our Residential Whole Loans are mainly adjustable rate mortgages that do not qualify for the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau’s (or CFPB) safe harbor provision for “qualified mortgages” ("Non-QM mortgages"). Our Manager’s review, relating to Non-QM mortgages, includes an analysis of the loan originator’s procedures and documentation for compliance with Ability to Repay requirements.  As discussed in Note 7 "Financing," we have and may continue to securitize whole loan interests, selling more senior interests in the pool of loans and retaining residual portions.  The characteristics of our Residential Whole Loans may vary going forward.
Non-Agency RMBS. — RMBS that are not guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or U.S. Government-sponsored entity. The mortgage loan collateral for Non-Agency RMBS consists of residential mortgage loans that do not generally conform to underwriting guidelines issued by a U.S. Government agency or U.S. Government-sponsored entity due to certain factors, including mortgage balances in excess of Agency underwriting guidelines, borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and/or level of documentation, and therefore are not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or U.S. Government-sponsored entity. The mortgage loan collateral may be classified as subprime, Alternative-A or prime depending on the borrower’s credit rating and the underlying level of documentation. Non-Agency RMBS collateral may also include reperforming loans, which are conventional mortgage loans that were current at the time of the securitization, but had been delinquent in the past. Non-Agency RMBS may be secured by fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages or hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.
Agency RMBS. — Agency RMBS, which are RMBS for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA” or “Ginnie Mae”), or a U.S. Government-sponsored entity ("GSE"), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”).  The Agency RMBS we acquire can be secured by fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages or hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages have interest rates that are fixed for the term of the loan and do not adjust. The interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages generally adjust annually (although some may adjust more frequently) to an increment over a specified interest rate index. Hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that are fixed for a specified period of time (typically three, five, seven or ten years) and, thereafter, adjust to an increment over a specified interest rate index. Adjustable-rate mortgages and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages generally have periodic and lifetime constraints on the amount by which the loan interest rate can change on any predetermined interest rate reset date. These investments can be in the form of pools, TBA and CMO (including interest only, principal only or other structures). 

GSE Risk Sharing Securities Issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. — From time to time we have and may in the future continue to invest in risk sharing securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Principal and interest payments on these securities are based on the performance of a specified pool of Agency residential mortgages. The payments due on these securities, however, are not secured by the referenced mortgages. The payments due are full faith and credit obligations of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac respectively, but neither agency guarantees full payment of the underlying mortgages.  Investments in these securities generally are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% real estate asset test applicable to REITs and generally do not generate qualifying income for purposes of the 75% real estate income test applicable to REITs. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to invest in such assets. 
Other investments. — In addition to MBS, our principal investment, we may also make other investments in securities, which our Manager believes will assist us in meeting our investment objective and are consistent with our overall investment policies.  These investments will normally be limited by the REIT requirements that 75% our assets be real estate assets and that 75% of our income be generated from real estate, thereby limiting our ability to invest in such assets.
Our Investment Portfolio

Investment Portfolio
Our investment strategy will focus on residential real estate related investments, including but not limited to non-qualified mortgage loans, non-agency RMBS, and other related investments. The portfolio transition is expected to be accomplished over 12-18 months. 
Our investment portfolio composition at December 31, 2021.
Our Financing Strategy
Previous to 2020, the Company had relied primarily on short-term repurchase agreement financing. During 2020, the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic made it challenging to obtain financing arrangements on favorable terms. In the latter part of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, terms for financing arrangements have improved significantly. As a result, we diversified our financing sources to provide an alternative to short-term repurchase agreements with daily margin requirements. We expect to continue to seek financing arrangements without daily margin requirements or with margin requirements that apply only after a significant reduction in the valuation of the assets financed, including but not limited to repurchase agreements, term financing, securitization and convertible senior unsecured notes, as the market permits. We believe the amount of leverage we use is consistent with our intention of keeping total borrowings within a prudent range, as determined by our Manager, taking into account a variety of factors such as general economic, political and financial market conditions, the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets, the availability and cost of financing the assets, the creditworthiness of financing counterparties and the health of the U.S. residential and commercial mortgage markets. We expect to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of two to four and a half times the amount of our stockholders’ equity, depending on our investment composition. We seek to enhance equity returns by effectively utilizing leverage and seeking to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility and daily margin calls. The following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

 | December 31, 2021 | | December 31, 2020 | | 
Total debt(1) | $ | 736,357 | | | $ | 527,720
Total equity | $ | 193,109 | | | $ | 255,112
Debt-to-equity ratio | 3.8 | | | 2.1 | | 

(1) Total debt excludes the securitized debt which is non-recourse to us
Our Hedging and Risk Management Strategy

Our overall portfolio strategy is designed to generate attractive returns to our investors through various economic cycles. In connection with our risk management activities, we may enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments. When purchased, our primary objective for acquiring these derivatives and non-derivative instruments is to mitigate our exposure to future events that are outside our control. Our derivative instruments are designed to mitigate the effects of market risk and cash flow volatility associated with interest rate risk, including prepayment risk. As part of our hedging strategy, we may enter into interest rate swaps, including forward starting swaps, interest rate swaptions, U.S. Treasury options, future contracts, TBAs, credit default swaps, and forwards and other similar instruments. There can be no assurance that appropriate hedging strategies will be available or that if implemented they will be successful.
Regulation
REIT Qualification
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We will generally not be subject to corporate U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we make qualifying distributions to stockholders, and provided that we satisfy, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, the REIT requirements including certain asset, income, distribution and stock ownership tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we lost our REIT qualification. The failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to stockholders.
Investment Company Act Exemption
We conduct our operations so that we are not considered an investment company under the 1940 Act in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires that: (i) at least 55% of our investment portfolio consist of "mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate," or "qualifying real estate interests," and (ii) at least 80% of our investment portfolio consist of qualifying real estate interests plus "real estate-related assets." We have relied and intend to continue to rely on current interpretations of the staff of the SEC in an effort to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. For more information on the exemptions that we utilize refer to Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Our net income depends, in part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring our target assets, we compete with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. In addition, other REITs with similar asset acquisition objectives, including others that may be organized in the future, compete with us in acquiring assets and obtaining financing. These competitors may be significantly larger than us, may have access to greater capital and other resources or may have other advantages. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, and establish more relationships, than us. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
Environmental Matters
We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or statement of position or result in material capital expenditures.
Employees and Human Capital
We have no employees. We are externally managed pursuant to the management agreement between us and the Manager dated May 9, 2012. All of our officers and two of our directors, James W. Hirschmann III and Bonnie W. Wongtrakool, are employees of our Manager. We benefit from our Manager's global infrastructure and operating platform, through which we are able to source, evaluate and manage potential investments in our target assets. Our Manager strides to create a diverse and inclusive workforce in operating its business. By supporting, recognizing, and investing in the employees, our Manager believes that it is able to attract and retain the highest quality talent.
 Measures implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 included travel bans, "shelter in place" restrictions and curfews, banning large gatherings, closing non-essential businesses, mandating vaccinations, and generally promoting social distancing in the workplace. Our Manager's concern for its employees' well-being resulted in the decision to have a significant amount of its employees working remotely. We do not believe the remote working environment hurt our operations. Although many of these measures and recommendations have been lifted or suspended, some remain in place. As of December 31, 2021, a significant portion of our Manager's employees continued to work remotely. 
Corporate Governance and Internet Address
We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. The Board has appointed a lead independent director to enhance governance. Currently, four of six directors are independent directors, so our Board of Directors consists of two-thirds independent directors. The audit, nominating, and corporate governance, risk, and compensation committees of our Board of Directors are composed entirely of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers and directors.
