Item 1. Business
Overview
NantHealth is a leading next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company that is transforming the way critical diseases, such as cancer, are known and treated. Specifically, we combine new uses of molecular science and technology to give physicians, health systems, caregivers, pharma, payors and even patients more actionable knowledge than ever before about how to diagnose and treat complex diseases like cancer.
To accomplish this, we employ a unique systems-based approach to personalized healthcare applying novel diagnostics tailored to the specific molecular profiles of patient tissues and integrating this molecular data in a clinical setting with large-scale, real-time biometric signal and phenotypic data to track patient outcomes and deliver precision medicine. For nearly a decade, we have developed an adaptive learning system, NantHealth solutions (which was originally introduced to the market as CLINICS), that integrates our unique molecular profiling solution, software, middleware and hardware Systems Infrastructure and collects, indexes, analyzes and interprets billions of molecular, clinical, operational and financial data points derived from novel and traditional sources to continuously improve decision-making and optimize our clinical pathways and decision algorithms over time. As a pioneer in the era of big data and augmented intelligence, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from multiple significant market opportunities as healthcare providers and payors transition from fee-for-service to value-based reimbursement models and accelerate their pursuit of evidence-based clinical practice.
Our mission is to show the world a better path to the cure and to empower:

• | providers to seamlessly act on the best evidence-based information available to better fulfill their roles as caregivers rather than financial managers


• | payors with the necessary tools to better fulfill their roles as stewards of an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving healthcare system


• | biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate development of drugs for critical illnesses based upon the unique biology and specific health conditions of patients


• | patients with the knowledge to enable active participation in the management of their own health, or self-care.

We derive revenue from sales of licensed software and maintenance, software-as-a-service, hardware, services, and GPS Cancer to healthcare providers, payors and self-insured employers.
We Are Uniquely Positioned to Address Transformative Shifts across the Healthcare Continuum
The efficiency and effectiveness of the current healthcare system is often hindered by the complex, dynamic interplay of three uncoordinated and segregated domains: the knowledge domain, the care delivery domain, and the payor domain. The disparate nature of these domains, and their often-inconsistent incentives and conflicting priorities, can inhibit interoperability and coordination. We believe two simultaneous, transformative shifts are highlighting these critical deficiencies of the current healthcare environment:

1. | A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost. Unsustainable escalating healthcare costs, which we believe is due to broken fee-for-service models, is driving many stakeholders and governments towards alternative delivery models. Despite significant investments in EHRs and other technologies designed to enable the transition to more value-based care, we believe that, in a fee-for-service model, the economic incentives generally discourage coordination amongst healthcare stakeholders and encourage volume-driven (rather than outcomes-driven) decision-making. This model results in healthcare and financial data that remains largely segregated into “walled gardens.” Thus, patient data often remains static and cannot be easily shared or interpreted due to siloed legacy proprietary platforms that lack interoperability.

2. | A paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric-driven medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding repositories of complex data from traditional and novel sources. Advances in molecular medicine require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts in real time to arrive at a single patient decision. Molecular profiling often generates hundreds of gigabytes of data per patient, which must then be transported, stored, analyzed and interpreted with supercomputing and/or high performance computing environments. We believe the rapid pace of medical advancements, the massive amount of molecular data and the frequency of biometric information is overwhelming many providers’ ability to process that information at the point of care, thereby inhibiting the paradigm shift to individualized medicine.

We believe these shifts and the associated challenges require next-generation and advanced technology systems that deliver more information than ever available before, faster and with more relevance and accuracy than healthcare continuum has experienced. NantHealth has the unique ability to extract, normalize, assemble, analyze and interpret the increasingly overwhelming relevant data to implement molecularly precise, biometrically monitored medicine and effectively transition to value-based care. Given the magnitude of these shifts and the difficulty involved in addressing the associated challenges, we believe our solution platforms combined with NantOS are unmatched and put us best positioned to be at the forefront of multiple large and growing market opportunities. We estimate that the potential market size of our combined solution offerings exceeds $50 billion globally. We have invested significant capital and healthcare and biotechnology expertise over nearly a decade to develop, acquire and integrate the components that we believe address many of the challenges faced by stakeholders across the continuum of care.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading evidence-based, personalized healthcare company transforming the way critical diseases, such as cancer, are known and treated. We seek to enable clients to deliver improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses by applying novel diagnostics tailored to the specific molecular profiles of patient tissues and integrated clinically with large-scale, real-time biometric signal and phenotypical data. To accomplish this goal, we plan to deploy NantHealth solutions designed to address and accelerate the transformational shifts occurring in healthcare: rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to value-based models and the paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric driven medicine. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Driving global reimbursement, awareness, and adoption of GPS Cancer. To drive the growth of GPS Cancer in the United States, we have deployed an integrated, multi-pronged strategy to (1) obtain reimbursement through large national and regional payors and self-insured employers and (2) drive oncologist awareness and adoption in those regions with reimbursement. Likewise, we are pursuing international growth through a combination of reseller agreements and other unique partnership models to yield predictable and recurring revenue. To date, we have announced agreements and agreements in principle for US insurance coverage for GPS Cancer with health plans, providers and self-insured employers, as well as reseller agreements in multiple countries outside of the US. Traction amongst commercial payors, employers, and partners continues to accelerate globally. We are also increasing recognition of GPS Cancer through engaging and educating oncologists, cancer patients, caregivers, patient advocacy groups and other key oncology stakeholders, and communicating patient outcomes through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. Finally, we are a founding member of the Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 Global Immunotherapy Coalition, which we believe will help accelerate the adoption and validation of GPS Cancer.


• | Increasing sales of NantHealth solutions, including, NantOS and NantOS applications, to healthcare providers, payors and self-insured employers. We are marketing NantHealth solutions, including NantOS and NantOS applications, to healthcare providers transitioning from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based care models in pursuit of improved patient outcomes and lower costs. We believe we are positioning NantHealth as a next-generation payor intermediary and partner with healthcare payors and self-insured employers as they roll out value-based model partnerships and transition to value-based precision care.

• | Broadening usage of our solutions among existing clients. Our broad portfolio of NantHealth solutions affords us a unique ability to expand our agreements with existing clients through cross-selling opportunities. We are actively focused on leveraging existing relationships to create these opportunities to drive additional revenue for our solutions including GPS Cancer, NantOS and NantOS applications. Many of our clients are already successfully using certain of our solutions, and we are working to demonstrate the full value of our integrated Systems Infrastructure and platforms.


• | Expanding our business in international markets. We are executing our go-to-market strategies internationally, creating global awareness of our brand and taking steps towards our goal of broader adoption worldwide. We are expanding aggressively in Canada, the United Kingdom and Southeast Asia and opportunistically in other international markets where we or our strategic partners have established relationships and our clients have healthcare business interests.


• | Developing new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions. We plan to continue to leverage NantHealth solutions, and our NantOS middleware solution to create new features and functionality that our clients can use to drive improved patient outcomes and lower the cost of care.


• | Complementing internal growth with strategic acquisitions. We believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our competitive position by acquiring additional companies with complementary products and technologies and/or acquiring rights to proprietary products or technologies from third parties.

Our Industry
Today, the U.S. healthcare landscape is being redefined by the shift toward value-based reimbursement models and an explosion of the quantity, frequency and complexity of data. We believe there is a demand for platforms that utilize a molecularly precise and systems-based approach to addressing the following underlying transformative shifts and challenges.
A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost.
In response to the rising cost of healthcare, government and private payors and providers are introducing value-based care models. In value-based models, providers assume increased levels of clinical and financial responsibility for patient outcomes, instead of being reimbursed strictly based on the quantity of services provided. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has set a goal of tying 30 percent of Medicare fee-for-service payments to quality or value through alternative payment models by 2016 and 50 percent by 2018. We believe that healthcare platforms that efficiently assist healthcare stakeholders to transition to these value-based models will be best positioned to capture this opportunity.
Challenges associated with the adoption of value-based models
The healthcare continuum can be viewed as an aggregation of three distinct domains:

• | The knowledge domain, including academic centers, scientific institutions and companies that discover and commercialize medical and scientific knowledge;


• | The care delivery domain, including hospitals, physicians and other constituents that deliver healthcare to patients; and


• | The payor domain, including insurers, governments and self-insured employers that administer and provide funding to the healthcare system.

The disparate and fragmented nature of these domains and economic incentives under traditional fee-for-service models frequently result in overtreatment, high costs and suboptimal patient outcomes. Fee-for-service models are as a general matter inherently site-centric, volume driven, reactive in nature and uncoordinated. In contrast, value-based models are generally more patient-centric, outcomes-focused, proactive and coordinated across the care continuum.
- 7 -

Despite a clear need, the design and implementation of next-generation interoperable systems has been limited due to reliance on legacy, site-specific, fee-for-service technology systems and infrastructure. Since the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009, providers and payors have made significant investments in EHRs, and other technologies meant to enable the transition to value-based care. Despite extensive investment and coordination, the introduction of value-based models has been limited due to the shortcomings of legacy, proprietary systems and the reliance on unstructured data that hinders interoperability and cannot be sufficiently shared or manipulated to produce actionable findings. Value-based models require collection and analysis of longitudinal treatment, outcomes and financial data at the patient level, regardless of treatment site. Critically, these systems must also securely safeguard patient data in compliance with stringent HIPAA and other privacy regulations. We believe that there is a significant need for interoperability platforms that dynamically access, normalize, integrate and update information from disparate sources across the healthcare continuum in real time. Secure interoperability platforms can allow for more comprehensive solutions development that proactively connect, deliver business and clinical intelligence and enable enhanced provider and patient engagement.
A paradigm shift to molecularly precise and real-time biometric-driven medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding categories of complex data from traditional and novel sources.
The collection and interpretation of molecular profiles and real-time biometric monitoring has the potential to dramatically improve quality and outcomes.
Evolution to comprehensive molecular analysis
Advances in sequencing over the last 15 years and the associated cost efficiencies have led to the development of targeted therapeutics initiating the transformation from “one size fits all” treatments to personalized, molecularly precise medicine. Single marker and gene panel diagnostic tests have now advanced from the research to clinical care settings. Oncology is leading the rapid advances in molecular testing and the development of targeted therapeutics based on increasing understanding of the impact of molecular profile on disease progression. Recent publications, including The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network genomic and molecular characterization studies, support selection of treatment regimens based on the underlying molecular pathways and related genomic alterations in the genetic profile of the tumor compared with the patient’s own germline, as opposed to the anatomical location of the cancer in the patient’s body. Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown, called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is requiring more comprehensive genomic and proteomic analysis, which is increasingly becoming embedded in drug approvals. As a result, we believe comprehensive genomic and proteomic analysis is positioned to become the standard of clinical care, replacing single marker or gene panels in treating cancer patients.
Oncology has been an early adopter of precision medicine due to the cost as well as inconsistent and often poor clinical outcomes associated with many traditional “trial-and-error” treatment regimens. While oncology represents the most immediate opportunity, we believe other disease areas are beginning to experience a similar evolution, with immune-related diseases, central nervous system disorders and transplants having a high potential for adoption of personalized medicine. We believe technologies that enable the capture, aggregation and analysis of massive volumes of genomic data will further bolster the growth of precision medicine and its expansion from cancer to additional disease states. Over time, we believe this will lead to identification of drugs that target specific pathways by using a universal personalized companion diagnostics platform, ultimately resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

Limitations of the existing single marker and gene panel approach
The human genome is comprised of approximately 20,000 genes and 3 billion DNA base pairs. Until recently, scientists have focused on less than 2% of the genome that is responsible for coding proteins. As a result, most diagnostic tests today only analyze specific genes, or gene panels, exploring only a fraction of the human genome, while incorporating “a priori” assumptions that capture only a subset of the most common gene alterations. These alterations are calculated relative to a reference genome of a population instead of a patient’s own healthy tissue, or germline. Gene panels that utilize a reference genome often fail to capture key, medically actionable mutations or incorrectly highlight mutations present in both the germline and cancer tissue. This is important because disease-specific insights are derived not only from DNA alterations, but also from protein expression and protein activity at the cellular level, known as proteomics. Analyses that exclude whole genome sequencing, RNA and quantitative proteomic analysis and comparisons to an individual’s germline instead of a reference genome can lead to materially false positive and false negative results. A more comprehensive molecular analysis would allow providers to develop personalized treatment regimens, replacing existing costly “trial-and-error” approaches to treatment. A comprehensive molecular analysis, including both germline and cancer tissue, would make no assumptions as to the molecular driver of the patient’s disease and would capture mutations that are commonly missed by gene panels.
Challenges associated with the adoption of comprehensive molecular analysis
Comprehensive molecular analysis combines whole genome-to-germline comparison and protein expression analysis. Comprehensive molecular analysis has been difficult to perform in a practical, timely and cost-effective manner because it has long run times to complete sequencing, creates hundreds of gigabytes of complex data per patient, which must be transported, stored and analyzed with supercomputing and/or high performance computing environments in a clinically relevant period of time, and requires large capital investments required to perform sequencing at scale. Furthermore, the absence of adaptive machine learning algorithms to enable efficient medical interpretation and effective protein expression analysis has inhibited the ability to derive value from the massive amount of data produced by comprehensive molecular analysis. Accordingly, comprehensive molecular analysis has primarily been utilized in the academic and research settings, and not in the clinical setting to inform treatment decisions. Finally, there have been insurance coverage and reimbursement challenges for comprehensive molecular analysis solutions, limiting their adoption.
Increasing proliferation and importance of real-time biometric data and its adoption in hospitals and other patient care settings
Several trends are contributing to the rising importance and availability of biometric data, including the increasing prevalence of connected devices in multiple care settings and the opportunity for proactive patient interventions to improve health outcomes. As hospital systems implement EHRs, they have installed hardware and software solutions to connect medical devices to collect periodic sampling of key patient metrics such as respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate. Providers have expanded these technologies into other care settings, including skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, outpatient facilities and patients’ homes. Concurrently, with the advent of connected devices, activity monitors and remote patient monitoring devices are achieving widespread adoption, allowing for the increased quantification of key biometric signals. Healthcare professionals have the potential to gain a more comprehensive view of an individual’s health on a real-time basis across care settings through increased adoption of patient monitoring devices. The increased availability of quantifiable biometric data allows for the implementation of decision support tools and proactive treatment interventions, potentially utilizing care pathways and learning algorithms to improve care outcomes.
Challenges associated with leveraging quantifiable, real-time biometric analysis in multiple care settings
An increasing amount of biometric data is being generated by the proliferation of connected devices. However, complexities associated with synthesizing this data into actionable insights remain an obstacle. Aggregating and maintaining a longitudinal record across multiple care settings remains a significant challenge because of closed proprietary systems that prevent integration of disparate data sources. Although many hospital-based medical devices can continuously stream data to an EHR, frequently the EHR can only accept periodic data, potentially missing a critically relevant patient episode. There is also a lack of comprehensive solutions that support physician decision-making in real time. The absence of effective data interpretation supported by adaptive machine learning or other algorithms is evidenced by “alarm fatigue” among many healthcare providers (a condition that can occur when one is exposed to many frequent alarms or alters and consequently becomes desensitized to them) as they struggle to establish optimal event thresholds.
Growth in complexity and its promise for value-based models
- 9 -

Advances in molecular medicine and real-time biometrics require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts to arrive at a single patient decision. With the enormous complexity of genomics and expression analysis derived from comprehensive molecular analysis, the pace of medical advancements, and the significant amount of data being created every day by patient care, payment and regulatory compliance systems, it is nearly impossible for a practicing physician to interpret and synthesize the deluge of complex information required for patient treatment.
We believe there is a considerable need for advanced adaptive machine learning algorithms to collect, index and analyze rich biometric, phenotypic, genomic and proteomic data at scale to support physician decision-making. Although this complexity creates significant challenges, it also presents opportunities for developers of systems infrastructures, platforms and learning systems that can identify clinically meaningful correlations that can be employed to improve patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe the increasing focus on value-based reimbursement models and evidence-based, personalized medicine will drive validation and adoption of NantHealth solutions. Recent statistics show that 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, resulting in a potential $173 billion of medical costs by 2020. Additionally, we see the precision medicine market growing substantially as comprehensive diagnostics and evidence-based medicine become increasingly important across multiple disease areas and likely assuming greater share of the combined biopharmaceutical and diagnostics markets. We expect several factors to drive adoption of our universal diagnostics solution GPS Cancer, which enables an increased understanding of molecular pathways and their targets, such as:

• | Improved pharmacoeconomics, including the use of more cost-effective drugs approved for other indications (such as asthma and diabetes) in cancer treatment regimens;


• | A clearer understanding of critical drug resistance information;


• | Increased adoption of bundled payments as providers and payors recognize the efficiency of optimized therapies; and


• | Increased awareness and published clinical results demonstrating the benefits of evidence-based molecular medicine.

We believe the potential addressable market for NantHealth solutions to be in excess of $50 billion annually and will continue to grow in relation to the market-share gains of value-based models and the adoption of precision medicine.
NantHealth Solutions
Our NantHealth solutions comprise a highly differentiated, integrated model for the delivery of healthcare, comprised of our unique molecular profiling solution, software, middleware and hardware systems infrastructure, which integrates patient data management, bioinformatics, and molecular medicine, enabling value-based care and evidence-based clinical practice. Our platform and our multi-domain solutions are designed to address some of the most pressing cross-domain challenges across the healthcare continuum. Built upon our unifying Systems Infrastructure, our solutions are single-domain and cross-domain offerings that can be applied, for example, within a hospital system or for a hospital system and a commercial insurance provider in an Accountable Care Organization, or ACO, crossing multiple domains. We believe this integrated and comprehensive systems-based approach uniquely positions us (i) to deliver 21st century molecular and biometric signature-driven precision medicine and potentially change the current paradigm of uncoordinated healthcare and (ii) as a next-generation payor intermediary who facilitates payment for value.

• | Oncology Solutions. Our comprehensive set of interoperability, advanced diagnostics, risk stratification and decision support solutions (eviti) can enable our clients to improve decision-making and coordinate care across the healthcare continuum. Our molecular profiling solution, GPS Cancer, is the only comprehensive and commercially available clinical cancer platform incorporating and integrating whole genome (comparing both a patient’s normal and tumor tissue), RNA, proteomic and molecular pathways information into a clinical report that analyzes this data and identifies actionable targets and potential clinical treatment decisions.

- 10 -


• | Patient and Provider Solutions. Our provider solution software and middleware, comprised of an integration of our various solutions, including cOS, FusionFX, DeviceConX, VitalsConX and NaviNet Open, or collectively NantOS, leverage the data available on our Systems Infrastructure to enable patient-centered engagement and coordination across care locations. Our web-based and mobile NantOS apps include patient, provider and collaboration portals for advanced care coordination, including real-time vitals connectivity, clinical and administrative workflow, eligibility and benefits, claims, referral and readmissions management solutions, secure messaging and analytical applications to measure outcomes and costs. Our database of clinical pathways and decision algorithms is continuously being enhanced, enabling the delivery of evidence-based clinical decision support. Our device connectivity modules and flexible applications analyze and interpret patient- and provider-specific information and can deliver critical clinical and administrative insights.


• | Payor Solutions. Our payor NantOS app solutions establish daily access to the clinical practice and caregiver and leverage the data available on our Systems Infrastructure to facilitate payment for value. We believe our position between the payor and the provider allows us to align incentives as a next-generation payor intermediary, to help payors ensure consistent evidence-based treatment pathways and to accelerate pre-adjudication and lower administrative overhead for providers. This can ultimately drive quality of care and streamline workflows while improving control over the administrative and operating costs associated with eligibility and benefits, claims processing, referrals, authorizations, document exchange and review utilization. Our multi-payor collaboration NantOS app solution, NaviNet Open, offers provider end users a uniform set of workflows and services across many or all the payors with whom they routinely collaborate. This multipayor experience benefits payors and providers alike. Providers can benefit from a uniform experience and toolset across multiple payor relationships, and the payor can benefit from the uniform application of best practices, tools, and options, as well as the reduction in costly errors and phone-based interactions that can stem from a non-uniform end-user experience. Our NantOS app solutions can also identify high-risk patient populations, implement advanced diagnostics and FDA-approved, real-time biometric patient monitoring solutions to identify opportunities for precision medicine and preventative interventions, and enable provider and payor engagement in integrated and coordinated value-based models.

We designed our NantHealth solutions to enable providers, payors and self-insured employers to overcome challenges encountered across the knowledge, care delivery, and payor domains within the healthcare continuum. We are a leading vendor of payor-provider collaboration solutions (NaviNet Open), used by approximately 450,000 active users located in all 50 states. We also estimate that over 75% of all oncology practices in the United States have used eviti, our decision support solution. As of December 31,2016, our solutions have been widely adopted, with over 100 million lives across our Patient, Provider, and Payor solutions.
In this Annual Report, the term “lives” means the number of individuals and their eligible dependents enrolled in a particular insurance program (within the payor domain) plus the number of unique patients where clinical data can be accessed by our solution (within the care delivery domain), and “active users” means users of our NaviNet Open platform transacting at least once in the previous 90 days.
The chart below describes our systems-based approach to the delivery of healthcare:

 NantHealth’s platform includes (i) advanced molecular diagnosis (Box 1), defining treatment (Box 2) and patient engagement (Box 6) for the knowledge domain; (ii) care coordination and delivery of care (Box 7), real-time clinical learning (Box 8), clinical analytics and predictive modeling (Boxes 9 and 10) for the delivery domain; and (iii) payment for value (Box 11) in the payor domain. Our biopharmaceutical partners, including our affiliates NantKwest and NantBioScience, Inc. and other biopharmaceutical participants in the Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 Network, provide key therapeutic treatments, novel next-generation agents and clinical trials and validation (Boxes 3, 4 and 5) for the knowledge domain.
To our knowledge, no other system currently exists that provides insights from the scale of the individual patient molecular signature level up to entire populations. Our platforms are designed to normalize, organize and integrate our client’s data streams, engage their workflows and implement our adaptive learning system. Our unique systems-based approach features:

• | Advanced Molecular Diagnosis (Box 1). Our solutions enable diagnosis at the individual molecular signature level with genomic and proteomic analysis solutions through GPS Cancer, population-level analytics and risk stratification at the molecular level.


• | Define Right Treatment Before Treatment Begins (Boxes 2, 9, 10). Our solutions support decision-making with near real-time bioinformatics and evidence-based protocols using our eviti solution, enabling the clinician to potentially make more optimal treatment decisions.


• | Patient Engagement (Box 6). Our solutions inform the patient, patient advocate and caregivers to improve patient engagement, satisfaction and compliance and encourage active participation in the management of their own health (self-care).


• | Care Coordination and Delivery of Care (Box 7). Our solutions enable point-of-care connectivity and coordinate and deliver care with clinical and administrative workflow collaboration portals, care coordination applications and clinical intervention engagement (mission control).


• | Real-time Clinical Learning (Box 8). Our solutions implement advanced analytics and real-time clinical learning while monitoring and measuring outcomes to enrich data sets and to implement proactive and preventative clinical intervention engagement.


• | Payment for Value (Box 11). Our solutions facilitate payment for value, better outcomes at lower cost, using our evidence-based approach to the clinical practice of medicine through our inter-domain collaboration portal NaviNet Open.

This integration continually enhances our database, clinical pathways and decision algorithms, which we believe leads to critical mass and network effects that further our competitive advantage.

Our Systems Infrastructure
Our unique interoperable Systems Infrastructure has been built over the last decade to address the knowledge, care delivery and payor domains. As of December 31, 2016, our NantHealth solutions or its components have been widely adopted, with over 100 million lives across our Patient, Provider, and Payor solutions, processing nearly 30 million payor-provider transactions per month with approximately 450,000 active users nationwide. 
 NantOS is a powerful systems infrastructure that organizes and integrates the data streams that form the foundation of our adaptive learning system. It serves as the foundation of our platforms and products and provides critical data and inter- and intra-domain interoperability to coordinate the complex, dynamic interplay of otherwise uncoordinated and segregated healthcare data. This systems-based approach enables the near real-time transfer and clinical translation of genomic and proteomic analysis, biometric signal data and actionable information to the care delivery domain, with access to a HIPAA-compliant cloud, providing the coordination of reimbursement between the care delivery domain and the payor domain. We have created and are applying a highly scaled, adaptive learning system that is designed to address many of the specific limitations and complexities of the current siloed healthcare system.
Our Systems Infrastructure is comprised of:

• | Access to next-generation genomic and proteomic analysis technologies with near real-time bioinformatics, provided as part of GPS Cancer through our affiliate, NantOmics;


• | Access to a secure HIPAA-compliant cloud environment maintained internally through our subsidiary NantCloud Services;


• | Device connectivity in over 350 client sites to what we estimate to be more than 30,000 medical devices and collecting tens of billions of vital signs annually with the ability to connect to over 500 medical device and health and wellness sensors; and


• | Open architecture, service-oriented software platform-as-a-service, enabling the integration and interoperability of disparate electronic medical records through 250 clinical, financial and operational systems connectors and 300 infrastructure and healthcare services, facilitating real-time clinical learning.

Our access to CAP- and CLIA-certified sequencing capability, coupled with supercomputer environments, enables us to deliver comprehensive genomic and quantitative proteomic analysis. We have established a HIPAA-compliant, secure and scalable cloud computing, storage and transport infrastructure capable of processing, storing and transporting petabytes of diverse, protected patient data. Our device connectivity and real-time biometric monitoring software and hardware solutions allow us to aggregate data through the open architecture platform, from one of the largest libraries of in-hospital and remote medical devices and wearables on the market. Our cloud-based NantOS accesses, integrates and updates information from disparate clinical, operational and financial systems to create a dynamic and actionable dataset. This framework enables us, our clients and third-party partners to develop an integrated ecosystem of compatible applications.
We believe other organizations have not yet been able to integrate these components in a similarly near real-time and continuous manner, and this personalized, evidence-based molecular approach, combined with our NantHealth solutions, significantly differentiates us from our competitors. In addition, third parties may use our solutions to deliver drugs to patients in a more predictive, preventative and evidence-based manner, potentially improving patient outcomes and pharmacoeconomics.
Product Overviews
GPS Cancer:
GPS Cancer is a comprehensive molecular profile that integrates whole genome (DNA) sequencing, whole transcriptome (RNA) sequencing, and quantitative proteomics by mass spectrometry, providing oncologists with unprecedented insights into the unique molecular signature of a patient’s cancer to inform personalized treatment strategies. The results of the GPS Cancer profile can provide oncologists with insight into cancer therapies that may have potential benefit - including active clinical trials - and those therapies to which the cancer may be resistant. GPS Cancer profiling is conducted in CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratories.
- 13 -

GPS Cancer compares a total of 6 billion DNA base pairs between a patient’s healthy normal (or germline) sample and the tumor sample (usually Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded-FFPE or fresh frozen tissue) each encoding for over 20,000 genes. All the RNA (over 200,000 transcripts) from the tumor sample is sequenced to confirm and give evidence of expression of mutations found in the genome. We identify affected molecular pathways that are drivers of a patient’s cancer by analyzing DNA and RNA sequence data against our curated database of over 15,000 nodes within approximately 1,500 protein pathways. GPS Cancer’s quantitative proteomics analysis, also performed on FFPE samples, is built on a platform of laser microdissection, proprietary liquid tissue processing and mass spectrometry-based Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM), allowing measurements of proteins at the attomolar level. We gain insights into a patient’s affected protein pathways using all these methods and determine actionable peptide targets to recommend potential therapeutic agents specifically designed for the individual patient.

Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases. As such, understanding genomic alterations and protein expression in tumor samples can help to identify potential treatment options for the personalized management of people with cancer. 
Whole genome sequencing of a person’s tumor sample against their normal sample highlights molecular alterations that are specific to their tumor DNA, and RNA sequencing subsequently confirms the alterations identified in the DNA of a person’s tumor. Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing can provide vital clinical information about individual molecular alterations in tumors that result in abnormal proteins, which can be important targets for many cancer therapies.
Quantitative proteomics measures the amounts of clinically relevant proteins. Knowing the quantity of a specific protein present in a tumor can help oncology care providers better understand potential responses to conventional therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapies, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies.
GPS Cancer identifies genomic and proteomic alterations with high clinical relevance to each person’s tumor. The alterations are then matched to drugs that might be effective against tumors containing the specific change. By identifying the totality of alterations from whole genome sequencing, honing in on alterations that are associated with protein expression from RNA sequencing, and combining clinically relevant proteins determined from quantitative proteomics, a more accurate and comprehensive molecular profile is assembled that can inform the therapeutic options available to oncology care providers and their patients.
We believe that this in turn can drive better outcomes at lower costs through:

• | Enabling utilization of lower cost chemotherapy with knowledge of quantitative proteomic chemo-resistance or chemo-sensitivity biomarkers before treatment begins


• | Preventing inappropriate utilization of high cost monoclonal antibody therapy


• | Providing quantitative evidence of presence of actionable targets for high cost small molecule targeted therapy


• | Providing molecular insight into the potential efficacy of high-cost checkpoint inhibitors


• | Enabling enrollment into clinical trials and the Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 program


• | Driving to low cost cancer vaccine immunotherapy combined with low-dose chemotherapy

- 15 -

For example, according to a presentation at ASCO 2015, it was estimated that a typical patient receiving a combination therapy of two checkpoint inhibitors, one anti-PD-1 agent and one anti-CTLA-4 agent, would cost approximately $300,000 with approximately $60,000 being the patient’s out-of-pocket cost (assuming a 20% copay). Applying this figure to the nearly 600,000 patients dying from metastatic cancer annually (no adjuvant therapy), the treatment would cost society nearly $174 billion annually. Studies suggest that cancer therapeutics such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are more effective when there is a high neoantigen and nonsynonymous mutation (i.e., results in a change in the amino acid sequence) burden in the tumor. We believe GPS Cancer’s ability to identify mutation burden and neoepitopes through its comprehensive omics analysis will serve as a critical and novel source for both pre-treatment efficacy analysis and individualized immunotherapies for cancer patients. 
GPS Cancer Report
Our GPS Cancer solution further leverages novel adaptive machine learning algorithms that match the identified alterations to an extensive and evolving library of signaling pathways, drugs and drug targets, regardless of indication, to provide predictive analyses that can enable the physician to make decisions regarding the potential efficacy of personalized therapies, as well as points of resistance. GPS Cancer results are available to the ordering physician in a concise report or through a cloud-based genome browser. While the GPS Cancer report does not recommend treatments, it can enable the treating physician to develop a personalized treatment plan after discussing with the patient the available treatment options and the potential risks associated with each treatment option. The GPS Cancer report can be utilized by the physician in several ways, as described in the “call out” bubbles on the example reports below. The report may:

• | List targets based on DNA/RNA/quantitative protein analysis that may be treated by FDA-approved drugs either in an on-label or off-label manner based on peer-reviewed clinical data;


• | List findings that suggest a particular targeted therapy which the physician would otherwise use may not work due to a potential resistance marker;


• | List the quantitative expression of certain proteins that suggest a chemotherapy agent may be more likely, or alternatively, less likely, to work; and


• | Provide the information necessary for the physician to decide whether it is appropriate to place the patient in a clinical trial.

Insurance Coverage
In January 2016, a large health plan announced that it would provide insurance coverage for GPS Cancer, representing the nation’s first such insurance coverage for a whole genome and proteome molecular diagnostic platform. This health plan’s medical policy provides coverage for GPS Cancer for any of the following conditions in an individual with documented performance status that identifies treatment of their condition as a viable option:

• | Cancer of unknown primary;


• | Rare cancers (i.e., less than one percent of cancers) with metastases for which there are only documented case reports and small series of treatment experience;


• | Metastatic cancer that has progressed after treatment with a regimen of chemotherapy and for which additional chemotherapy is indicated;


• | Primary brain cancer;


• | Pediatric cancers;


• | Triple negative breast cancer;


• | Virally infected tumors;


• | Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has progressed after treatment with two different regimens of chemotherapy and for which additional chemotherapy is indicated; and


• | Individuals eligible for cancer immunotherapy.

Subsequently, we have announced coverage of GPS Cancer by providers as well as self-insured employer groups. GPS has also been selected as the molecular profiling tool of choice for other projects (e.g., pilot, research study), including the Philadelphia Coalition for a Cure, which is seeking to advance treatment options for patients with brain tumors. We believe traction among commercial payors and self-insured employers will continue to grow. 
Competitive Advantage of GPS Cancer’s Comprehensive Molecular Analysis Capabilities
Many of the current gene panels on the market are limited to only a small fraction of the genome and fail to cover the full molecular profile of a patient’s tumor. Because these panels measure less than 2% of the approximately 20,000 genes and less than 0.04% of the entire genome, the results may be fraught with a significant number of false negatives, potentially leading to erroneous clinical decisions. Furthermore, many gene panel tests fail to directly compare the patient’s tumor to the patient’s normal (or germline) genome, potentially leading to false positives by suggesting a mutation is in the cancer alone when it is really a normal variant.
Unlike most commercially available genomic tests, which are based on interrogation of predefined alterations in only a small fraction of the genome, GPS Cancer is based on whole genome sequencing (of tumor and normal samples), RNA sequencing and inferred and quantitative proteomics. GPS Cancer compares 6 billion DNA base pairs (tumor and normal), sequences 200,000 RNA transcripts and provides analysis for over 15,000 nodes within approximately 1,500 protein pathways. In addition, the test provides quantitative analysis of targeted proteins at the attomolar level.

GPS Cancer Case Study
In 2015, data were presented on 3,783 patients at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, entitled “Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Proteomics in the Clinical Setting: Integrating Whole Genome and RNA Sequencing with Quantitative Proteomics to Better Inform Clinical Treatment Selection” and showed that only 4.6% of altered DNA actually resulted in increased expression of a given actionable gene, whereas in 26% of instances, increased expression of an actionable gene could not be traced back to an alteration in the DNA. In 69% of positive mutation calls as determined by the gene panel, no increased RNA expression occurred, thus potentially resulting in a false positive gene panel reading.
GPS Cancer could help overcome these challenges by unearthing the breadth of mutated DNA via whole genome sequencing, identifying relevant mutations by RNA sequencing, and predicting potential therapeutic outcomes by quantifying clinically relevant proteins in a patient’s tumor sample. For example, as shown in the figure below, for a highly actionable target such as the protein HER2, 105 of 237 patients had elevated expression resulting from gene amplifications, whereas 117 patients with gene alterations did not result in elevated expression and 15 patients had elevated expression without gene alteration, thus revealing the potential false positives and false negatives by competitive products that do not take expression (e.g., RNA and protein) into account.
- 20 -

RET DNA mutation is a nucleotide variance in the DNA. The mutations, if expressed at the RNA level, may go on to cause changes at the protein level. If the mutation is expressed at the protein level, the tumor may be treatable by targeted therapies, such as vandetanib or cabozantinib, which act on the RET protein. Of 438 patients, only 7 had both DNA mutations and corresponding RNA expression (needed for the anti-RET targeted therapies to be potentially effective). In another 98 patient samples, DNA was altered but RNA had little or no alteration, suggesting that the DNA mutation was misleading and did not correspond to an altered protein level. Hence, treating the patient based on DNA findings alone would likely be unsuccessful. In another 333 patients, the RNA changes suggested elevated expression of the RET protein but there was no corresponding DNA change. Thus, testing RNA revealed many patients who may respond to the drug but would not have been identified on DNA testing alone.
- 21 -

Furthermore, for actionable targets such as HER2, RET and a larger menu of analytes (a chemical substance that is the subject of analysis), GPS Cancer reveals whether the amount of a given protein found in a patient sample is above or below what we have determined to be a threshold for response, which we believe contradicts the notion that a presence or absence of a protein is sufficient for the prediction of response. For HER2, published reports provide that -750 amol/ug (attomolar per microgram) is the lower limit for response to trastuzumab, whereas 2,200 amol/ug of HER2 is predictive of complete response (as measured by overall survival after 6 years) in 100% of breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting. Patients in this setting with HER2 <2,200 amol/ug should be monitored more frequently after initial treatment. Additionally, as presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, or SABCS, in 2015, GPS Cancer also distinguishes between modes of therapy in that patients with high HER2 expression respond favorably to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab whereas low HER2 expressors respond more favorably to the HER2 small molecule therapeutic lapatinib. Immunohistochemistry and other non-quantitative tests may not accurately predict response to therapies or distinguish between different therapies targeting the same analyte.
We believe the ability of GPS Cancer to measure clinically relevant proteins is important. The amount of certain proteins in cancer can provide valuable information on the potential response to targeted therapies such as trastuzumab, cabozantinib and to chemotherapies and immunotherapies. We believe there exists a level of protein that determines either a response or lack of response to these therapies. For example, a high expression of the protein ERCC1 in a tumor predicts that it will not respond to DNA damaging chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin. ERCC1 repairs the damage to DNA caused by the platinum-based chemotherapies thus making them ineffective. Conversely, high expression of the protein hENT1 is potentially predictive of response to the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine since hENT1 is needed to allow gemcitabine to enter the cancer cell.
The case study below, presented at the 2016 Congress on Targeted Anticancer Therapies, is a demonstration of the utility of GPS Cancer in therapy selection. In a patient with metastatic uterine cancer, where an oncologist has a choice of chemotherapies with various mechanisms of action, GPS Cancer potentially eliminates some of the guesswork involved in choosing therapeutic regimen.
The y-axis shows the level of the patient’s cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) count, which is indicative of disease progression as it measures the amount of CA-125 in a person’s blood. CA-125 is a protein that is a biomarker, or tumor marker, and is found in greater concentration in cancer cells.
The case study progresses as described below:
- 22 -


• | The patient is initially treated with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (MK-3475). Since the target analyte, PD-L1, is expressed in low amounts, or less than the 100 amol/ug in the “Efficacy Threshold” column of the table to the left of the graph below, published reports would suggest a decreased likelihood of benefit from the treatment. Consistent with the expected result, the patient did not respond well to the treatment, as reflected by an increase in the CA-125 level in the graph below.


• | The patient is then treated with paclitaxel (Taxol) and trastuzumab (HerceptinTM). Published reports indicate an increased likelihood of benefit from the treatments if the TUBB3 expression level is below 850 amol/ug and the HER2 expression level is greater than 740 amol/ug for paclitaxel and trastuzumab respectively. In this case, the patient’s tumor expresses less than 100 amol/ug of the TUBB3 analyte and 4,995 amol/ug of the HER2 analyte. The result of the treatment is consistent with the published studies’ efficacy thresholds. As illustrated in the graph below through the significant decline of CA-125, the patient had a beneficial response to the combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab until approximately June of 2015, a period of nine months, when CA-125 starts to increase again.


• | The patient is then taken off paclitaxel and put on doxorubicin. GPS Cancer results suggest a reduced likelihood of response to doxorubicin since the level of TOPO2A analyte needed for such a response is greater than 1,530 amol/ug (per published studies) and the patient’s level is only 472 amol/ug. As illustrated in the graph below, the treatment was not effective as there was an increase in CA-125 during the duration of time the patient was being treated with doxorubicin.


• | After the ineffective doxorubicin treatment, the patient is then put on pemetrexed. Published studies indicate that pemetrexed is more likely to be effective when the FRa analyte is present in amount greater than 1,510 amol/ug. In this case, the patient’s tumor expressed 10,500 amol/ug of the FRa analyte, well in excess of the published analyte threshold. Consistent with the efficacy thresholds, the patient had a beneficial response to pemetrexed, which is visually depicted by the decreasing CA-125 level in the bottom right of the graph below.

GPS Cancer is the only comprehensive and commercially available clinical cancer platform incorporating and integrating whole genome (comparing both a patient’s normal and tumor tissue), RNA, proteomic and molecular pathways information into a clinical report that analyzes this data and identifies actionable targets to inform clinical treatment decisions.

GPS in Rare Diseases and Chronic Illnesses
Although we are deploying GPS initially for cancer, we believe this solution has potential application in identifying molecular profiles and germline mutations in rare diseases and chronic illnesses. Our molecular profile solutions are being used by a large academic research institution to examine the genomic familial drivers of cardiac disease and to perform additional research in ALS, obesity, suicide and diabetes, among other diseases.
For example, in July 2016, NantHealth announced a partnership with the University of Utah to analyze the entire genomic profiles of at least 1,000 individuals who have a history of rare and life-threatening diseases and conditions in their respective families. The landmark project is focusing on researching the genetic causes of 25 conditions, including, breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autism, preterm birth, epilepsy, and other hereditary conditions.
GPS Cancer: Proprietary Methods and Software
Patents with claims related to GPS Cancer are issued or allowed in the United States and internationally, and GPS Cancer is the subject of several U.S. and foreign patent applications. The proprietary methods and software components underlying GPS Cancer include:

• | Liquid Tissue. Extracts lysates from FFPE tissue using proprietary methods to examine tumor-normal proteins and genomes.


• | Transporter Software. Securely transfers unassembled data from sequencing instruments to the analytical custom-designed supercomputing environment.


• | Contraster Software. Rapidly identifies genomic variants in a patient’s tumor samples and compares it to that patient’s germline or proprietary database of disease associated genes.


• | Paradigm Software. Integrates DNA sequencing data from the contraster software with RNA sequencing data to identify alterations in cellular signaling behavior that are driving disease progression. The algorithm matches the alterations to the library of all known signaling pathways and all drugs and drug targets, irrespective of indication, to potentially help predict the effectiveness of personalized therapies and points of resistance.

Define Right Treatment Before Treatment Begins (eviti):
The rapid advancement of molecular and biometric medicine is overwhelming many physicians’ cognitive ability, while uncoordinated, non-evidence based treatment pathways are increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. 
Within our oncology solutions, eviti, our decision support solution, provides evidence-based clinical decision support, which is a critical element to ensure optimal treatment regimens. eviti is a SaaS-based clinical decision support solution that centralizes clinical content, treatment cost data from Medicare reimbursements and treatment toxicity data. The clinical content is curated by our dedicated team of clinicians, including oncologists and oncology nurses, who convert published literature and clinical trials into structured information that can be used for decision support. The eviti Advisor product is an overlay on this platform and allows both physicians and patients to access this data to better inform treatment decisions. Thus, physicians can readily stay abreast of the latest advances in cancer care. In addition, physicians can simplify their ordering, since the treatment protocols can be exported to EHR systems for order execution.
eviti provides value to our clients through its access to over 10,000 active clinical trials updated weekly and over 2,500 evidence-based treatment regimens for the treatment of cancer arising from over 40 different anatomical locations. Unique to the care delivery domain, physicians also benefit from improved claim processing by using our eviti platform that issues a pre-authorization “eviti code” when the physician chooses an approved evidence-based clinical pathway, thereby validating appropriate treatment and pre-adjudicating the claim. This is an important step in that payors and providers are collaborating on high-value, evidence-based clinical pathways as opposed to non-value added reimbursements and denials of payments. We estimate that over 75% of all oncology practices in the United States have used eviti.
- 24 -

eviti also serves as the clinical trial-match engine for The American Cancer Society. At the 2016 HIMSS Conference, eviti was named #1 in Clinical Decision Support by Black Book Research, an independent industry analyst firm that tracks the top-performing healthcare technology companies. eviti is typically sold to health plans on a per member (or life) per month basis. These health plans sponsor the solution and provide eviti free of charge to oncologists and their staffs. 
The snapshot of our system below illustrates how different cancer treatment options for a patient is presented to compare treatments across a variety of metrics, including treatment outcome, plan compliance and costs. By providing the oncologist with this comparison, we believe eviti drives compliance and a greater number of treatments to be in accordance with evidence-based pathways.

Patient and Provider Engagement (NantOS and NantOS Apps):
Our modular patient portal applications leverage NantOS and underlying data to engage and inform the patient, patient advocate and caregivers.

• | Patient Portal NantOS App: Our Patient Portal NantOS app enables providers to incorporate the patient (or his or her proxy) as a full member of the care team, which can result in improved patient engagement, satisfaction and compliance. This NantOS app can pull information from EHRs and integrate the growing mobile health app and wearable health data into the patient’s health records, providing a single access point and unified health record across the healthcare system. In addition to aggregating key data from the EHR and other sources, this NantOS app enables the patient to have convenient access to perform common tasks such as scheduling appointments, refilling prescriptions and reviewing lab tests. One feature enables the patient to actively participate in the management of their own health (self-care). The patient portal NantOS app includes a watch list that visualizes and explains key metrics, such as lab values, that a patient

may want to track over time with the goal of better managing their health. This application meets or exceeds certain Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements and can enable hospitals to achieve this certification.

• | Health Heritage NantOS App: The Health Heritage NantOS app is a patient-facing tool designed to empower users to collect, maintain and share their detailed personal and family medical histories and receive personalized risk assessments and recommendations. Branching logic and guidance enables users to easily construct the foundation of their medical history. This NantOS app can also work with health systems to extract key details from a user’s electronic medical record automatically, in part, using its custom-built Natural Language Processing engine. Secure methods are provided for family members to share and maintain up-to-date family information. All information is currently used to identify individuals at risk for seven common cancers (breast, colorectal, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and uterine) and their related hereditary cancer syndromes and to provide evidence-based recommendations for users to discuss with their providers.


• | Cancer Genome Browser: Allows users to view a patient’s entire genome with the goal of understanding the totality of the genomic and proteomic expression information.


• | Care Coordination and Real-Time Connectivity (NantOS and NantOS Apps): A key part of our care coordination and real-time connectivity solutions is to enable hospital systems, integrated delivery networks, health plans and government sponsored health organizations and their clinicians to improve productivity, more easily collaborate across the care team with both patients and payors through next-generation collaboration portals, and better manage the growing volume of data from numerous disparate sources to obtain actionable insights for improving performance at the enterprise, office and individual physician levels. Even where a hospital system may have a single EHR vendor across all its facilities, our provider engagement solution can be valued as a comprehensive, real-time solution to integrate the larger continuum of care (e.g., pharmacy, laboratory, imaging center and patient’s home). Many other marketplace offerings typically provide retrospective analyses in siloed applications or do not adequately integrate health information across the continuum of care.

Our modular care coordination and connectivity applications leverage NantOS and underlying data to provide real-time data to the point-of-care. Our NantOS apps allow us to engage clients to provide next-generation collaboration portals for providers and caregivers to allow for patient-centered, proactive (as opposed to site-centered reactive) care. These NantOS apps connect and enhance disparate systems with next-generation devices and applications to help implement and coordinate pathway compliance. Our secure, cloud-based NantOS accesses, integrates and updates information from disparate clinical, operational and financial systems to create a dynamic and actionable dataset. NantOS, our middleware, can be utilized on a stand-alone basis, bundled as part of a more comprehensive solution with NantOS apps, or used as a platform of services to develop industry specific applications.
- 26 -

NantOS, our clinical operating system: Our provider solution software and middleware, comprised of an integration of our various solutions including cOS, FusionFX, DeviceConX, VitalsConX and NaviNet Open, or collectively NantOS, leverage the data available on our Systems Infrastructure to enable patient-centered engagement and coordination across care locations. NantOS is our core, cloud-based platform designed to address many of the coordination and interoperability challenges across the knowledge, provider and payor domains.
NantOS is patient centered and site neutral, as opposed to a site-centered operating system, which utilizes protocols and models derived from solutions targeting many of the coordination challenges inherent in supply chain management and real-time air-traffic control. NantOS enables stakeholders to better coordinate and utilize real-time integrated information, which we believe creates notable advantages relative to the traditional approach of mining retrospective and siloed sources of information. This system can be implemented by a single hospital, hospital systems, integrated delivery networks, physician groups, health plans, self-insured companies or any combination of the above, to enable value-based models. NantOS is based on an open Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, and provides connectors, a data model, and services and makes accessible APIs that we, our clients and third parties can potentially leverage to develop next-generation healthcare applications. NantOS is compatible with both traditional data sources (e.g., EHR, labs, imaging, pharmacies, medical claims and pharmacy claims), and next-generation sources, including big data (genomics and proteomics) and real-time data sources (e.g., consumer wearables, biometrics and monitoring devices). We believe this can give our clients a unique multi-dimensional perspective from which they may garner novel insights and seek to identify and solve complex challenges associated with transitioning to value-based models and managing large amounts of data. NantOS can enable datasets to be interrogated by adaptive machine learning algorithms that can further inform and optimize decision-making. We believe that as we engage incremental populations, the predictive modeling capability will improve with the addition of a richer base of real-time information from individuals to whole population level phenotypic, molecular and biometric data.
- 27 -


• | Data Layer: Our platform extracts, transforms, aggregates and contextualizes a vast array of molecular, clinical, financial, operational and other relevant data from internal and external sources into a more patient-centric information model. NantOS integrates with the systems provided by major health information technology vendors, including Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Epic, Cerner, McKesson and Allscripts, and has a robust library of over 250 EHR, pharmacy, lab, imaging, cost accounting, provider data and financial systems connectors. Additionally, our device connectivity platform has the ability to normalize and track data from over 300 inpatient and outpatient medical devices as well as over 200 consumer health and wellness sensors. Our data layer architecture is flexible to support federated, distributed or enterprise data repository approaches. This flexibility enables us to balance transactional, analytical, decision support, information security and performance requirements across different stakeholders and geographies. With an increasingly disparate set of data sources, ensuring data quality is a fundamental challenge in this space. Adjusting duplicative, incorrect, absent or irrelevant data into a consistent terminology is a core capability of our master data management services. We believe our experience integrating real-world data across millions of patients and billions of patient-level clinical data points across the globe enables us to provide some of the most usable, patient-centric data available. Furthermore, our clinical terminology translation service allows us to map disparate EHR, lab and pharmacy systems into a common clinical informatics model.


• | Services Layer: We believe we have one of the most highly reliable and scalable suites of infrastructure and healthcare specific services. Clients and third parties use these services to build or integrate key applications. A SOA is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. We have been developing cloud-based SOA architectures for over a decade. We believe we have one of the largest open services SOA platforms in healthcare, with a growing library of over 300 infrastructure and healthcare specific services. Some of our infrastructure services include master data, identity management, security, audit and message orchestration. Other healthcare specific services include labs, orders, device, genomics, insurance administration and care plans.


• | Application Programming Interfaces: APIs are a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications. Nearly all the NantOS services have exposed APIs that enable distributed application development environments. These APIs enable us, our clients and third parties to develop ecosystems of compatible applications. Using these APIs, we have developed a series of applications such as secure messaging, value monitor, care coordination, population explorer and patient and provider portals. Additionally, certain of our clients and third-party partners have built their own internal and cross enterprise solutions using NantOS’ exposed APIs.

This application leverages data across disparate physician electronic medical record, or EMR, systems and hospital information technology systems to provide important post-discharge care for high-risk patients, thereby potentially reducing costs. It also allows hospitals to potentially reduce exposure to readmission penalties from CMS and commercial payors.


• | Referral Management NantOS App: The Referral Management NantOS app is a web application that allows for the creation and tracking of a patient referral that includes up to date documentation of their care for viewing and managing by the care team. A referral may be as simple as a provider requesting a patient consultation from another provider or as complex as a primary care provider requesting that a specialist assumes responsibility for all or part of a patient’s treatment. This NantOS app manages the entire life-cycle of the referral process-creation, scheduling, management, procedures and results documentation. Role-based views and workflows facilitate each step in the referral process. The 360-degree view and near real-time care information keep every clinician notified of the patient’s progress throughout their continuum of care. Additionally, this NantOS app can retrieve referral requests from a health information exchange.


• | Secure Messaging NantOS App: The Secure Messaging NantOS app is an easily integrated information exchange solution that can help improve care coordination while protecting patient privacy. Messages are transported between trusted parties using the direct trust standards. The identity of recipients and the security and privacy of electronic protected health information are designed to be assured for the exchange participants, including providers, clinicians and patients. Patient information can be sent to or received from third-party direct messaging applications as attachments via direct protocols. Each message contains a unique patient context that allows the recipient to view the patient’s clinical record with a single click.

Real-Time Clinical Learning (NantOS, NantOS Apps and Engagement Services):
Our near real-time clinical learning solutions leverage NantOS and underlying data to provide real-time data to measure and monitor key provider performance metrics and consist of (i) a set of business intelligence dashboards and value monitors in the areas of medical operations, quality, patient safety and finance, and (ii) high-risk patient engagement services through home health and health coaching services. Our real-time clinical learning NantOS apps include:

• | Outcomes Analytics: Outcomes Analytics is a set of applications that run on the NantOS platform that allows payors and providers to perform comparative effectiveness studies. The NantOS big data infrastructure provides multiple levels of outcomes data starting with structured and standardized models to unstructured, schema-on-read models that can ingest large volumes and varieties of data (phenotype, omics, bio-metric, etc.). The omics results data from the reference labs and the phenotypic data from EMR and financial/cost data is normalized into a single model and made available for comparative research purposes. Outcomes Analytics is then used to create cohorts and design research studies using the study designer. We also make available to our customers a NantHealth-wide customer outcomes data repository derived from our other customers that have agreed to share de-identified data for comparative effectiveness research purposes, enabling our customers to search for cohorts and obtain access to a wider database of patients beyond their own patient cohorts.


• | Value Monitor NantOS App: The Value Monitor NantOS app is designed to measure and monitor providers with respect to resource usage, procedure usage, efficiency, cost and customer satisfaction as compared to their peer group. Value Monitor also looks at the near real-time costs incurred versus outcomes achieved. Currently, Value Monitor is looking at high-level outcomes such as length of stay, readmissions and mortality (as specified by the CMS value-based purchasing program).


• | Quality Scoring NantOS App: The Quality Scoring NantOS app monitors quality of care across a patient’s care team and records compliance with existing pay-for-performance measures as well as custom measures with the goal of ensuring high-quality outcomes and expected reimbursement.

- 31 -


• | Population Health Assessment NantOS App Suite: We believe controlling costs requires identifying and exploring cohorts most in need of targeted interventions, necessitating advanced risk stratification at the population level. Our NantOS population health assessment applications consist of:


• | Risk Stratification NantOS App: The Risk Stratification NantOS app provides analysis and reporting applications and algorithms that can enable users to gain insight into operational or financial risks within their patient population and identifies detectable characteristics associated with unwanted outcomes (e.g., hospital readmissions or longer-length stays).


• | Population Explorer NantOS App: The Population Explorer NantOS app is an application used to analyze and stratify populations into various groups of patients with common attributes. After stratifications are complete, patients in each strata or cohort can be assigned to specific care plans. These stratifications can provide insight into the population and segment provider performance. We use several groupers including the Hopkins Grouper for identifying high-cost and high-risk patients and the Lace Algorithm for identifying patients that are at high risk for readmission. The Population Explorer NantOS app also creates disease registries by analyzing the patient populations by ICD-9 and ICD-10 classifications.


• | “Mission Control” Patient Engagement Services: We provide targeted health services and interventions through our remote “mission control” patient engagement center where our team of clinicians develops clinical care plans for certain high-risk patients identified in our risk stratification process (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and cancer patients). These services are intended to encourage behavioral modification and are supported by clinical psychologists, pharmacists, nurses and nutritionists.


• | Home Health Services: We provide home healthcare services that enable adults to be cared for in their homes through Assisteo. Our home health business also provides an opportunity to potentially understand the effectiveness of new technologies and develop clinical care plans for patients in alternative healthcare settings. High-risk patients with chronic diseases identified through our “mission control” patient engagement services may be proactively managed through our home health service which can result in avoidance of unnecessary, expensive visits and admissions to the emergency room and hospital.

Chronic Disease Program Case Study for Real-Time Clinical Learning:
We have initiated a wellness program with a large financial institution focused on improving employee health and satisfaction and reducing annual healthcare costs. We are implementing our Systems Infrastructure across the knowledge, care delivery and payor domains as the program fuses behavioral science with healthcare wisdom. Each participant is stratified by risk level and personality type and offered connected personal health devices along with access to our patient portal and health coaches. Their historical health data is combined with near real-time biometric data to continuously monitor the participant’s activity. Our interactive business analytics create personalized care pathways that are executed, and measured with the goal of ensuring compliance and accountability. Our predictive modeling engine embedded in our platform can enable dynamic patient engagement.
Patient Engagement Center:
We provide targeted health services and interventions through our remote “mission control” patient engagement center, which is staffed by our own employees and consultants, consists of clinical psychologists, pharmacists, nurses and nutritionists. Our GPS Cancer patient engagement team, which we previously marketed as our NantCare team, also includes healthcare professionals who possess specialized skills and knowledge about, and provide specific support for, GPS Cancer. Specifically, for non-GPS Cancer matters, our patient engagement team develops clinical care plans for certain high-risk patients identified in our risk stratification process (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and cancer patients). These services are intended to encourage behavioral modification and track outcomes and pursue interventions. For GPS Cancer, our support team spearheads obtaining patient consents and documentation; coordinating logistics for tissue collection; educating caregivers, office staff and patients about GPS Cancer generally; coordinating interpretation of results from the GPS Cancer reports using our own team of oncologists and nurses to liaise with a patient’s caregiver, including addressing substantive questions or concerns; and serving generally as the customer service or call center for fielding patient service questions and resolving issues. Our patient engagement center is a critical component of our GPS Cancer solution.

Payment for Value (NaviNet Open):
Our NaviNet Open multi-tenant payor portal establishes daily access to the clinical practice and caregiver and leverages the data available on NantHealth solutions with the goal of facilitating payment for value. We believe our position between the payor and the provider allows us to align incentives as a next-generation payor intermediary, to help payors ensure consistent evidence-based treatment pathways and accelerate pre-adjudication and lower administrative overhead for providers. This is designed to ultimately drive quality and streamline workflows while helping better control the administrative and operating costs associated with eligibility and benefits, claims processing, referrals, authorizations, document exchange and review utilization. This multipayor experience can benefit payors and providers alike. Provider users can benefit from a uniform experience and toolset across multiple payor relationships, and the payor can benefit from the uniform application of best practices, tools, and options, as well as the reduction in costly errors and phone-based interactions than can stem from a non-uniform end-user experience. Our payor-provider collaboration solutions are used by over 2,000 hospitals. We also estimate that more than 70% of physicians’ offices nationwide connected to our NaviNet Open app during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our suite of NaviNet Open apps include:

• | Plan Central: Provides each health-plan client with the ability to provide end users with a branded custom-content experience that allows plan customers to communicate, broadcast, share, and inform end users in support of their business. Plans can benefit from an open communication channel to the entire provider community, and providers can benefit from the ability to access plan-specific communications in one place, across many plans.


• | Eligibility and Benefits: Delivers rich patient eligibility information on a single, user friendly screen, allowing providers to verify insurance and benefit levels at the time of a patient visit or as part of the billing cycle.


• | Claims Status Inquiry: Allows provider office staff access to near real-time, detailed claim status information, potentially eliminating the need for the provider office to call a health plan directly to maintain a healthy revenue cycle. Users can check claim status at any time following a claim submission, and can check all claims regardless of whether submission took place on our collaboration platform or via another method. Reducing phone calls would not only eliminate costs, but also dramatically improve provider network satisfaction.


• | Claims Management: A suite of powerful, yet easy-to-use claims-related provider applications consisting of web-based Claim Entry and Submission, Claim Repair, Claim Adjustment, Claims Log, and Claim Attachments. With these applications, provider office users can submit new claims with or without attachments, repair and re-submit rejected claims, and adjust claims that were processed or paid incorrectly due to a billing error. Notably, Claim Adjustment and Claim Attachments are both able to support any claim - regardless of whether the original claim was submitted through NaviNet, a practice management system, or even a clearinghouse. With NaviNet Open Claims Management, health plans finally have a solution to eliminate costly paper claims and attachments as well as the phone calls and manual processes associated with claims follow-up, correction, and resubmission. Additionally, providers now have access to a powerful set of claim-related applications without needing a sophisticated EMR or even a practice management system.


• | Document Exchange: Designed to ensure that relevant clinical data are available at the right place and right time to improve overall patient care, while reducing inefficiencies in communication and transaction completion. The solution can enable rich, bi-directional interactions between payors and providers in a flexible, bi-directional, multi-tenant service, available alone via API, or in the context of our collaboration application portal.


• | Authorizations: Allows provider staff to submit near real-time authorizations and conduct subsequent status inquiries directly with authorizing health plans. The simplified workflow guides provider choices by offering relevant information such as preferred-provider status.


• | Advanced Referrals: Empowers providers to submit and access referrals in near real time. Key features of this application include a user-friendly, multi-payor portal, easily configurable business terms and automated decision support. The application supports provider offices with a broad range of referral information. This can result in increased provider productivity and reduced operational costs through near real-time access to up-to-date and complete referral network information.

- 33 -


• | Provider Data Management: A web-based, multi-payer application that allows providers to update, validate, and attest to their provider information directly. The Application allows providers to communicate provider information updates to health plans in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and state-based network adequacy mandates. The NaviNet Open Provider Data Management Application enables health plans to improve provider directory accuracy, increase operational efficiency, and adhere to compliance and audit checks. 

NantHealth Systems Infrastructure to Enable NantHealth Solutions:
As the backbone to our Systems Infrastructure and Platforms, we have established a highly secure and scalable cloud-based computing, storage and transport infrastructure-as-a-service capable of processing, storing and transporting petabytes of diverse data. Our infrastructure also supports the aggregation of lab, device, EHR, medication, claims and imaging data, in addition to transporting, storing and analyzing enterprise resource planning, or ERP, cost and other key operational and financial data. We host our applications and serve all our clients from four redundant data centers in geographically diverse locations.

The terms of the agreement include an annual minimum of $2.0 million in fees for years 2016-2020, $25.0 million in fees for years 2021-2023 and $50.0 million in fees for years 2024-2029 paid to NantOmics.
In June 2015, Allscripts purchased a 10% equity stake in our company for $200.0 million in cash. In addition, NantCapital, LLC, or NantCapital, a personal investment vehicle of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, announced a $100.0 million investment into Allscripts. NantCapital’s investment was executed through a private placement of Allscripts common stock. The investments and commercial agreement strengthen the partnership between Allscripts and our company, originally announced in March 2015, to develop an integrated, evidence-based, personalized approach to healthcare solutions, and specifically cancer care. We plan to use Allscripts’ scale, global network of hospital and physician clients and leading software solutions, combined with our clinical platform, applications and connectivity devices to build out the infrastructure for new personalized, precision medicine programs for our clients to improve cancer care. Together, our goal is for physicians and patients to have the tools to stay engaged and active and provide the necessary intervention as early as possible.

We are a founding member of the Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 Global Immunotherapy Coalition, a cancer collaborative initiative seeking to accelerate the potential of combination immunotherapy as the next-generation standard of care in cancer patients, with the aspirational goal of developing an effective vaccine-based immunotherapy to combat cancer by 2020. As a foundation for the Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 Network, the National Immunotherapy Coalition is designing a master clinical trial protocol, entitled QUILT (QUantum Immuno-oncology Lifelong Trial) Program that is designed to incorporate a broad range of immune system components and synergistically integrate these elements by evaluating novel combinations of drugs in patients who have undergone next-generation, panomic molecular fingerprinting (whole genome, transcriptome and quantitative proteomic analysis) with the goal of achieving durable, long-lasting remission.
Our Clients
NantHealth solutions and technology platforms are used by key healthcare stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payors, self-insured employers, academic institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. NantHealth solutions, coupled with our engagement methodology, is designed to be tailored to meet the large-scale needs of governmental organizations and private entities while remaining convenient, intuitive and configurable at the user level. We believe that this provides us with a significant advantage over a siloed, single vendor approach, which often requires the removal or replacement of existing information technology infrastructure and applications. While historically many of our solutions have been consumed on a stand-alone basis, we are increasingly bundling our solutions as our clients look for comprehensive approaches that leverage our learning algorithms.
Our total revenue was $100.4 million, $58.3 million and $33.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, AIM - American Imaging Management, Inc. and Highmark Blue Shield each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, AIM - American Imaging Management, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
In January 2016, we acquired NaviNet. On a pro forma combined basis, two of NaviNet’s customers would have accounted for 10.5% and 10.6%, respectively, of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization is primarily comprised of direct sales executives and pre-sales support teams organized by account type and domain and subject matter expertise. We also leverage strategic reseller arrangements and a channel relationship coverage team.

• | Direct sales organization: We leverage domain and subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership, and relationships of our executives, senior management, and product leaders in our sales efforts. Our direct sales organization is divided into two focused teams, one dedicated to commercializing our GPS Cancer solution, and the other focused on NantHealth’s health information technology solutions portfolio. These two primary direct coverage teams include both sales professionals searching for new accounts and client engagement sales professionals responsible for developing existing accounts. Furthermore, sales professionals have unique expertise and specialized coverage for health plans, self-insured employers, health systems, and individual providers. Our account management organization is responsible for the continuity of current client relationships and the expansion of those relationships to include additional solutions and services.

We have a pre-sales organization that includes clinical, business and technical customer alignment teams to support our sales organization in addition to executive sponsorship with members of our senior management team.

• | Resale and channel partnership: In the United States, we have entered strategic resale arrangements with major partners, including EHR vendors (including Allscripts), in-hospital medical devices manufacturers and health plans who resell our solutions to their customer base. Internationally, we have entered resale arrangements with major telecommunications companies, systems integrators and other strategic distributors to accelerate our market adoption. Reseller revenue in 2016 and 2015 was $19.0 million and $9.2 million, respectively.

- 35 -

We also maintain business relationships with individuals and organizations that promote or support our sales or services. We refer to these individuals and organizations as our channel partners. These channel partners generally do not make sales directly like our resale partners, but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force. These relationships enable access to broader hospital and physician clients, leading software solutions and multiple cross-selling opportunities.
We complement our sales efforts with a marketing organization that plans and execute marketing and communication strategies that are centered on initiatives that drive awareness of our company and solutions. These initiatives include educating the market about our company broadly, as well as solutions-specific campaigns for lead generation. Marketing efforts also include participation in speaking engagements and strategic interfacing with key business and trade media personnel. We employ a broad array of specific events to facilitate these initiatives, including, but not limited to, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences such as HIMSS and or ASCO, events and client-focused programs such as key partner user groups.
Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from 6 months to 18 months from initial contact to contract execution. The sales cycle significantly differs based on the domain, type of solution and size of the client. Implementation, training and professional services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable.
Competition
The competitive landscape is highly fragmented, and to our knowledge, no single competitor currently offers similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings in comprehensive molecular analysis, software, and systems infrastructure, particularly with a focus on creating a learning system. Our primary competitors can be characterized by the following categories of companies that provide capabilities or solutions that compete with one or more of our platforms or solutions:

• | Genetic testing providers and platforms, such as Foundation Medicine, Caris Life Sciences, Personal Genome Diagnostics, and academic hospitals and research centers, including University of Michigan, Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories, and Washington University in St. Louis;


• | EHR vendors, such as Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, Epic, Flatiron Health, GE Healthcare, McKesson, Meditech, and Quality Systems;


• | HIE and integration vendors, such as Allscripts, Intersystems, and Orion Health; and


• | Healthcare IT decision support vendors, such as The Advisory Board Company, Castlight Health, HealthCatalyst, IBM, Inovalon and Truven (acquired by IBM).

The principal competitive factors in our industry include:

• | Breadth and depth of application functionality;


• | Ease of use and performance;


• | Network strength and level of user adoption;


• | Client testimonials and recommendations;


• | Breadth of client base;


• | Cloud-based delivery model;


• | Competitive and understandable pricing;

Research and Development
Our research and development efforts consist primarily of new product research and development, significant product improvements, the development of our knowledge base, the development of our online tools, such as our online portal and mobile applications, and the improvement and augmentation of our learning system.
Our ability to compete and attract new clients depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development team is responsible for the design and development of our applications and software tools. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development using modern programming languages, data storage systems, and other tools.
Research and development expenses increased $37.8 million or 158.6%, from $23.8 million in 2015 to $61.6 million in 2016. This increase was driven by an increase of $16.4 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of equity awards upon the consummation of our IPO and Series C/restricted stock vesting, as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of HCS and NaviNet. Specifically, we had $16.3 million due to an increase in personnel related expenses, and a $3.2 million increase in investments in information technology as we invest in assets to support future growth. In addition, we saw a $1.2 million increase in professional services expenses in connection with the growth of the business. Finally, we saw a $0.7 million increase in research and development general overhead expenses due to timing of certain research and development projects as well as the inclusion of research and development expenses of NaviNet. We expect to continue to invest in opportunities to leverage our solutions towards growth in our molecular sequencing and analysis and other solutions revenue.
Research and development expenses increased $6.9 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to $4.7 million of expense related to the HCS acquisition in July 2015. Our increased research and development expense reflects our continuing investment in our technology solutions including Systems Infrastructure and platforms.
We expect that our overall research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to innovate our informational technology capabilities, develop additional products, and expand our data management resources.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or acquired from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, continuing innovation, and acquisition and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of molecular diagnostics and healthcare technology products and services.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and acquired numerous patents and patent applications and we possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of healthcare technology products and services. As of March 30, 2017, our patent portfolio consists of the following matters relating to our proprietary technology and inventions: (i) six issued U.S. patents, of which five are U.S. utility patents and one is a U.S. design patent; (ii) 24 pending U.S. patent applications; (iii) one issued patent outside the United States; and (iv) two patent application pending in jurisdictions outside the United States.
For example, the issued U.S. patents include claims directed to the following subject matters:

• | Clinical operating system architectures and clinical operating system servers;


• | Designs for a medication container top;

- 37 -


• | Computer program generation systems and methods for creating a computer program by recording the actions of a user to easily repeat tasks to streamline workflow;


• | Computer systems and methods for monitoring changes in one or more variables in one or more target applications to efficiently synchronize computer applications; and


• | Hub-spoke model health care transaction systems and methods where a user interface communication bridge allows users to query disparate, remote databases and supports converting health care data to and from specific formats.

Our published U.S. patent applications include claims directed to the following subject matter:

• | Healthcare data networks and management methods for synchronizing healthcare databases;


• | Electronic caps for medication containers featuring e-ink and curved displays;


• | Night light devices operable in a medication compliance system;


• | Methods, logic, and apparatus for generating a healthcare signature for an individual;


• | Methods, logic, and apparatus for facilitating access to aggregated medical data;


• | Methods, logic, and apparatus for generating visual displays of medical data;


• | Methods, media, and apparatus for generating and executing individual patient care plans;


• | Methods, media, and apparatus for analyzing clinical, operational, and financial outcomes resulting from execution of patient care plans to determine status of medical care facilities and patients;


• | Methods and apparatus where personal health operating system uses n-gram analysis of sensor data to determine a person’s fitness;


• | Methods and systems for receiving, mapping, and routing medical event data associated with a patient;


• | Clinical operating system servers;


• | Methods, systems, and apparatus for modifying alarms at a medical device based on an alarm fatigue level of a user;


• | Systems and apparatus for adjusting the measurement latency of a patient sensor based on the health status of the patient to achieve real-time monitoring;


• | Systems and apparatus for reconfiguring networked patient sensors;


• | Systems for querying an electronic medical record database from a mobile device over a cellular network; and


• | Methods, systems, and media for data analysis, secured by a homomorphic encryption scheme, in a healthcare network environment.

The patent applications outside the United States in our portfolio were filed in the United Kingdom and India, and the granted patent outside the United States in our portfolio is in Taiwan.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. There is no limit on this patent term adjustment. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2031. If patents are issued on our pending U.S. patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2035. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of healthcare information technology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements.
- 38 -

With respect to our intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the processes involved in using those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in healthcare technology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented products and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our products and services. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development and testing of a potential product or service, it is possible that, before any particular product or service can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a relatively short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section captioned “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Associates and Culture
We view our employees, which we refer to as associates, and company culture as integral to the successful execution of our vision and mission. As a result, our leadership team prioritizes establishing trusting relationships with our clients, our partners, and each other. We encourage our associates to “rise up” to the challenge and believe that this collective mindset has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology, bioscience and healthcare to build and advance our offering. Our core values, which we seek to reflect in our work are:

• | Building and cultivating RELATIONSHIPS with our clients and each other. Treating individuals with dignity and respect and contributing to the success of others.


• | Demonstrating INTEGRITY by being intellectually honest, doing what you say, and engaging with others from a point of honesty and trust.


• | Delivering excellence in SERVICE. Aspiring to be the best through quality outcomes, partnering to optimize solutions, and holding self and others accountable for success.


• | Actively seeking out the opportunity to ELEVATE by speaking up, contributing feedback and ideas, and advancing the organization’s mission and purpose.

As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 922 full-time associates in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom (Including Great Britain and Ireland), Singapore and India, with 446 associates in operations, including engineering, 13 in product management, 226 in client services, 83 serving in a clinical function, 70 in sales and business development, and 84 in general and administrative functions. Associate engagement is a core tenant of our leadership focus and monitor of our performance and organizational health. None of our associates are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our associates to be good.

Government Regulation
The products and services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government healthcare programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and state regulation
The Omics services we perform fall under CLIA. A clinical laboratory is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct business. As to federal certifications, Congress passed CLIA in 1988, establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. The laboratory that performs our Omics services is CLIA-certified and is also required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for states with regulations beyond CLIA.
Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable, and timely. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees the CLIA program. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to governmental payor program beneficiaries and for many private payors. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.
Clinical laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards, and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory, like the one which performs our Omics services, that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA, may develop, manufacture, validate, and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires full validation, including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing.
- 40 -

In addition to the federal certification requirements under CLIA, certain states require clinical laboratories to maintain a state license. State licensure authorities typically regulate the day-to-day operations of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of its personnel and quality control. Certain states may also mandate proficiency testing, which requires the clinical laboratory to verify the accuracy of any test or procedure it performs. In addition, certain states require out-of-state laboratories to be licensed if they accept specimens from those states. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. In some cases, state licensure programs substitute for the federal CLIA program. In other instances, the state’s regulations may be in addition to the CLIA program. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment.
FDA
The FDA regulates the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, including in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Devices must undergo premarket review by the FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or pursuant to the FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. The FDA, to date, has generally not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, which are tests that are designed, manufactured, validated, and used within a single laboratory, and, therefore, we do not believe that the LDTs and other tests performed by the Omics laboratory currently require premarket clearance or approval. It is likely that the FDA will more actively regulate LDTs in the future, which could lead to premarket and post-market obligations. In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance documents stating that the FDA intends to change its policy and describing an approach to regulating LDTs using a risk-based, phased-in approach. If finalized as drafted, the guidance documents would impose premarket review and other medical device requirements under the FDCA on LDTs classified as high and moderate risk. Enforcement of premarket review and QSR requirements would be phased-in based on the risk of the LDT over a period of several years, but Medical Device Reporting requirements and compliance with either a new notification procedure in which the laboratory must provide the FDA with certain basic information about each LDT offered by their laboratory or the FDA’s device registration and listing requirements would be required within six months of finalization of the guidance documents (with limited exceptions). In November, 2016, the FDA state it had decided to delay finalizing its draft guidance on regulating LDTs, and it would be seeking input from the new presidential administration and Congress on the subject. In the meantime, the laboratory that performs the Omics services will maintain its CLIA certification, which permits the use of LDTs for the purpose of providing information for treatment and other clinical purposes.
The FDA regulations pertaining to medical devices govern, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, clearance or approval, record-keeping, packaging, labeling, storage, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution, and import and export of medical devices. Pursuant to the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA determines necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.

Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. We currently resell a blood pressure monitor, which is a Class II medical device that has received 510(k) clearance. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, the FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, but the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, a manufacturer submits a premarket notification 90 days before introducing a device into interstate commerce, but the FDA’s review of the premarket notification can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed. However, if the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), then the device would be regulated as a Class III device, discussed below. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness, a new premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA.
Class III devices are those deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those that are life-sustaining or life-supporting and for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA require the FDA’s clearance of a premarket notification in order to be marketed. However, most Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA process in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications. Some PMA applications are exempt from a user fee, for example, a small business’s first PMA.
Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with the FDA. A device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of some of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers quality management, design, production and process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, shipping, and complaint handling. Device manufacturers must submit to the FDA medical device reports for deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions and report certain field corrections and product recalls or removals. Some manufacturers also may be subject to post-market surveillance regulations. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new products, challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications, and a recommendation by the FDA to disallow a device manufacturer from entering into government contracts. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed. If a supplier fails to maintain compliance with a device manufacturer’s quality requirements, the manufacturer may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.

HIPAA and HITECH
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act.
The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and their business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. HIPAA also governs patient access to laboratory test reports. Effective October 6, 2014, individuals (or their personal representatives, as applicable), have the right to access test reports directly from clinical laboratories and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual.
These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied.
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are several state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without a certification of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws
In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.

In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a governmental payor program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.

Federal and state physician self-referral prohibitions
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.
Corporate practice of medicine
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the physician through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that have a physical presence in the state.
Healthcare reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. In the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in the health care system with the stated goal of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, the ACA contains certain measures that may be significant for our business. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions regarding initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies; the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures; and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The ACA also includes an annual excise tax on device manufacturers of 2.3% of the price for which manufacturers sell their devices. The excise tax has been temporarily suspended for calendar years 2016 and 2017, but will be reinstated in 2018 without additional Congressional action.
There have been other health reform measures taken since the enactment of the ACA. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction (known as sequestration) to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2013, which, following passage of subsequent legislation, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Furthermore, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years.
The current presidential administration and Congress are also expected to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the participants in the health care system as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.

Other regulatory requirements
The laboratory performing the Omics services is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples, and other human tissue. Typically, the laboratory uses outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Backlog
We have no material backlog of orders.
