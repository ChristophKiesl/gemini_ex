Item 1. | Business

The Company
Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and distributor of building products for industrial, transportation infrastructure, residential housing, renewable energy and resource conservation markets. Our business strategy focuses on significantly elevating and accelerating the growth and financial returns of the Company. We strive to deliver best-in-class, sustainable value creation for our shareholders for the long-term. We believe this can be achieved from a transformational change in the Company’s portfolio and its financial results. Our business strategy has four key elements, or "pillars," which are: operational excellence, product innovation, portfolio management, and acquisitions as a strategic accelerator.
Operational excellence is our first pillar in this strategy. 80/20 simplification ("80/20") is a core part of the operational excellence pillar and is based on the analysis that 25% of the customers typically generate 89% of the revenue in a business, and 150% of the profitability. Through the application of data analysis generated by 80/20 practice, we are focusing on our largest and best opportunities (the “80”) and eliminating complexity associated with less profitable opportunities (the “20”) in order to generate more earnings year over year, at a higher rate of return with a more efficient use of capital.
We have recently completed the second year of our multi-year simplification initiative. Since initiation of 80/20 in 2015, we have achieved nearly 250 basis points of operating margin improvement from 80/20 simplification initiatives and exceeded our initial five-year target ending 2019 of $25 million of pre-tax savings. We currently sit at the start of the "middle innings" of this 80/20 initiative, which means that there is both more work and more opportunity ahead. We are targeting greater structural changes affecting the balance sheet. We are just starting the follow-on management tools of in-lining our manufacturing processes linked with market-rate-of-demand replenishment tools. These follow-on tools are focused on process manufacturing the highest-volume products for our largest customers, and on a much higher level of capacity utilization. We expect these methods will yield additional benefits including lower manufacturing costs, lower inventories and fixed assets, and an even higher level of service to customers. Additionally, we will being focusing on driving top line growth with new and innovative products. Our initiatives will be tailored toward reallocating sales and marketing talent to target specific end user groups in order to better understand their needs and the various market opportunities that may be available. This effort is expected to produce ideas and opportunities that generate profitable growth.

Product innovation is our second strategic pillar. Innovation is centered on the allocation of new and existing resources to opportunities that drive sustainable returns. We are focused on those products and technologies that have relevance to the end-user and can be differentiated from our competition. Our focus on innovation is centered on four markets: postal and parcel products, residential air management, infrastructure and renewable energy. These respective markets are expected to grow based on demand for: centralized mail and parcel delivery systems; zero carbon footprint homes; the need for repairs to elevated bridges that are deficient or functionally obsolete; and energy sources not dependent on fossil fuels.
The third pillar of our strategy is portfolio management, which is a natural adjunct to the 80/20 initiative. Using the 80/20 process, we conduct strategic reviews of our customers and end markets, and allocate leadership time, capital and resources to the highest-potential platforms and businesses. Following the sale of our European industrial manufacturing business to a third party in April 2016, we next decided in December 2016 to exit our small European residential solar racking business and U.S. bar grating product line, which are proceeding as planned. These portfolio changes have helped contribute to the Company's realization of a higher rate of return on invested capital in 2016. We have now acted on all near-term portfolio assessments and expect no additional changes in 2017 while we continue to position our resources on more attractive projects and markets.
The fourth pillar of our strategy is acquisitions. We are focused on making strategic acquisitions in five key markets, four of which are served by existing platforms within the Company. The existing platforms include the same areas in which we are targeting the development of innovative products: postal and parcel solutions, infrastructure, residential air management and renewable energy. The remaining new platform is water management and conservation. These platforms are all large markets in which the underlying trends for customer convenience and safety, energy-savings and resource conservation are of increasing importance and are expected to drive long-term demand. We believe these markets also offer the opportunity for higher returns on our investments than those we have generated in the past. The acquisitions of Rough Brothers Manufacturing, Inc., RBI Solar, Inc., and affiliates, collectively known as "RBI" in June 2015 and more recently, Nexus Corporation ("Nexus") in October 2016, were the direct result of this fourth pillar strategy.
The Company serves customers primarily throughout North America and, to a lesser extent, Asia. Our customers include major home improvement retailers, wholesalers, industrial distributors, contractors, solar developers and institutional and commercial growers of plants. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 44 facilities in 17 states, Canada, China, and Japan giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service and quality to a number of regional and national customers and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the Asian markets.
The Company operates and reports its results in the following three reporting segments, entitled: 

• | Residential Products;


• | Industrial and Infrastructure Products; and


• | Renewable Energy and Conservation.

Our Residential Products segment services new residential housing construction and residential repair and remodeling activity with products including roof and foundation ventilation products, mail and package storage products, rain dispersion products and roof ventilation accessories. This segment's products are sold through major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, buying groups, roofing distributors, and residential contractors.
Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment focuses on a variety of markets including industrial and commercial construction, highway and bridge construction, automotive, airports and energy and power generation markets with products including perimeter security, expanded and perforated metal, plank grating, as well as, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges. This segment sells its products through steel fabricators and distributors, commercial and transportation contractors, and original equipment manufacturers.
Our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment focuses on the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems and commercial, institutional, and retail greenhouse structures. This segment's services and products are provided directly to developers, select distribution channels, and end users/owners.

We believe our operating segments have established reputations as industry leaders with respect to quality, service and innovation and have achieved strong competitive positions in our markets. We attribute their competitive standing in the markets primarily to the following strengths:
Leading market share. We have a leading market position in many of the products and services we offer, and we estimate that a majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were derived from the sale of products in which we had one of the leading U.S. market shares. We believe we have leading market shares in five distinct product families: roof-related ventilation; postal and parcel storage; structural bearings and expansion joints for bridges and other structures; institutional and retail greenhouses; and fixed-tilt ground mount racking for photovoltaic solar systems.
Provider of value-added products and services. We increasingly focus on providing innovative value-added products and services, such as mail and package storage solutions, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges, ventilation products, solar racking systems, and greenhouses which can solve end customer needs while also helping to improve our margins and profitability. Our products use complex and demanding production and treatment processes that require advanced production equipment, sophisticated technology and exacting quality control measures, along with specialized 
5

design and engineering skills. We also focus our acquisition strategy on manufacturers offering engineered products and services in key growth markets.
Commitment to quality. We place great importance on providing our customers with high quality products for use in critical construction applications. We carefully select our raw material vendors and use inspection and analyses to maintain our quality standards so our products meet critical customer specifications. To meet customer specifications, we use documented procedures utilizing statistical process control systems linked directly to processing equipment to monitor many stages of production. A number of our facilities’ quality systems are registered under ISO 9001, an internationally recognized set of quality-assurance standards, and other industry standards.
Strong liquidity profile. We strive to manage our cash resources to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to support the seasonality of our businesses, potential downturns in economic activity, and to fund growth initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased Nexus for approximately $25 million funded by our cash on hand. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2016 was $457 million, including $170 million of cash and $287 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our current low leverage and ample liquidity allow us to successfully manage our business, meet the demands of our customers, weather the cyclicality of certain end markets and take advantage of growth opportunities.
History of growth through acquisitions. Over the last decade, we also have grown through acquisitions, such as Nexus (greenhouses), RBI, (solar racking systems and greenhouses), D.S. Brown (expansion joints and bearing for roads and bridges), and Florence Manufacturing (mail storage), to help augment and diversify our products and customers while growing our net sales and earnings, and improving our operating characteristics. One of the key pillars of our Company's value-generating strategy is to use acquisitions as a strategic accelerator to drive a transformational change in our portfolio and its financial results.
Recent developments
On February 6, 2017, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its U.S. bar grating product line assets to a third party. The Company had previously announced, on December 2, 2016, its intentions to exit its U.S. bar grating product line as part of its portfolio management initiative. These assets were a part of our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment.
On December 2, 2016, the Company announced its decision to exit its European residential solar racking business and U.S. bar grating product line as part of its portfolio management and 80/20 strategic initiatives. These businesses contributed a combined $75 million in revenue and pre-tax operating losses of $6 million in 2016. This action will include the sale and closing of 5 facilities in early 2017. 
On October 11, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nexus for approximately $25 million subject to a working capital adjustment and certain other adjustments provided for in the stock purchase agreement. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand. Nexus is a leading provider of commercial-scale greenhouses to customers in the United States and is expected to generate revenues of $30 million in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The results of operations of Nexus have been included within the Renewable Energy and Conservation segment of the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
On April 15, 2016, the Company sold its European industrial manufacturing business to a third party for net of cash proceeds of $8.3 million. This business, which supplied expanded metal products for filtration and other applications, contributed $36 million in revenue to the Company's Industrial & Infrastructure Products segment in 2015 and had nearly break-even operating results. The divestiture of this business is in alignment with the Company's portfolio management assessments.
On June 9, 2015, the Company acquired RBI for $148 million. RBI has established itself during the past seven years among North America’s fastest-growing providers of solar racking solutions and is also one of the largest manufacturers of commercial greenhouses in the United States. RBI is a full service provider that engineers, manufactures and installs solar racking systems for solar developers and power companies. In addition, RBI designs, manufactures and erects greenhouses for commercial, institutional and retail customers. The acquisition of RBI has enabled the Company to leverage its expertise in structural metals manufacturing, materials sourcing and logistics to help meet the fast-growing global demand for solar racking solutions. The results of RBI have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial results since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Structured succession plan. In November 2016, the Company announced the planned retirement of Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Kenneth Smith, in early 2017. As part of a succession plan, the Company has used an outside search firm to identify 
6

potential internal and external candidates to fill the CFO role. The plan calls for the completion of the search process to conclude in early 2017. Mr. Smith will remain with the Company in order to facilitate a smooth transition prior to his retirement. Mr. Smith joined the Company in March 2008.
Experienced Management Team. Our executive management team is composed of talented and experienced managers possessing broad experience in operational excellence, new product development, and driving profitable growth gained over multiple business cycles. We made other senior leadership changes in 2016. Cherri Syvrud was hired and appointed successor to Paul Murray as Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Organizational Development in April 2016 in concert with the announcement of Mr. Murray’s planned retirement in early 2017. Other developments include the hiring of John Neil in the newly created position as Vice President of Strategic Operations and the hiring of John Mehltretter as successor to David McCartney as Vice President of Information Services upon announcement of Mr. McCartney’s retirement in early 2017, along with the promotion of William Vietas as successor to Richard Reilly as Group President of Renewable Energy and Conservation upon announcement of Mr. Reilly's retirement in early 2017.
Economic Trends
End markets served by our business are subject to economic conditions which include but are not limited to interest rates, exchange rates, commodity costs, demand for residential construction, demand for repair and remodeling, government funding, tax policies and incentives, the level of industrial construction and transportation infrastructure projects, and demand for renewable energy sources.
During 2016 and 2015, residential construction markets continued to steadily and slowly improve with U.S. new housing starts reaching 1.2 million in 2016. Residential repair and remodel activity also continued to improve over the past two years, along with a slight increase in re-roofing activity, which correlates to demand for our roof-related products. 
In our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment, sales declined for 2016 by 22%. The divestiture of our European industrial manufacturing business contributed to 7% of the decrease. The remaining decrease was primarily due to volume declines in our industrial products sold to the energy-related sector resulting from lower oil and gas prices as compared to 2015. Demand for our infrastructure products also declined as compared to 2015. While a new infrastructure bill was passed in December 2015 authorizing U.S. federal funding for five years, the FAST Act, the matching state funding required to obtain the federal funds was not available in key states we serve. We expect that enacted changes in legislation in many of these key states will provide funds that will support projects beginning in the latter part of 2017 which should positively impact future demand for products sold by this segment.
Demand for solar racking systems increased over the past year as end users continue to look for renewable energy sources that are not dependent on fossil fuels. In late 2015, U.S. legislation extending the Solar Investment Tax Credit was signed into law extending the credit beyond 2016 for both residential and commercial projects which is expected to stimulate continuing demand for solar racking systems. Demand for greenhouses was relatively stable in 2016; however, we expect demand to increase in 2017 for locally grown produce as well as public and private horticultural research.
Commodity prices for materials such as steel and aluminum began to rise towards the end of the year. These fluctuations impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and the pricing we offer to our customers.
Products
Residential Products
The Residential Products segment is primarily a manufacturer of metal and resin-based products used in residential new construction and for home repair and remodeling. This segment operates 12 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States giving it a base of operations to provide manufacturing capability of high quality products, customer service, delivery and technical support to a broad network of regional and national customers across North America.
We manufacture an extensive variety of products that are sold through a number of sales channels including major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, buying groups, roofing distributors, and residential contractors.
Our product offerings include a full line of: roof and foundation ventilation products and accessories, including solar powered units; postal and parcel storage products, including single mailboxes, cluster boxes for multi-unit housing and package locker systems; roof edging and flashing; soffits and trim; drywall corner bead; metal roofing and accessories; rain dispersion products, including gutters and accessories; and exterior retractable awnings. Each of these product offerings can be sold separately or as part of a system solution.
7

Within our Residential Products businesses, we are constantly striving to improve our product/solution offerings by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adapting to building code and regulatory changes, and providing new and innovative solutions to homeowners and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include adhesive roofing applications, electronic parcel lockers, roof top safety kits, chimney caps, heat trace coils and exterior, remote-controlled deck awnings for sun protection, and solar-powered ventilation products. Our electronic parcel lockers provide residents in multifamily communities a secure receptacle to handle both package deliveries and receipt of other delivered goods. Our ventilation and roof flashing products provide protection and extend the life of structures while providing for a safer, healthier environment for residents. Our cluster box mail delivery products provide delivery cost savings to the postal service while offering secure storage for delivered mail and packages. Our building products are manufactured primarily from galvanized and painted steel, anodized and painted aluminum, and various resins.
Within our manufacturing facilities, we leverage significant production capabilities which allow us to process a wide range of metals and plastics for our residential products. Most of our production is completed using automatic roll forming machines, stamping presses, welding, paint lines, and injection molding equipment. We maintain our equipment with a thorough preventive maintenance program allowing us to meet the demanding quality and delivery requirements of our customers. In some cases, the Company sources some products from third-party vendors to optimize cost and quality in order to provide the very best and affordable solution for our customers.
Industrial and Infrastructure Products
The Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment is primarily, but not exclusively, a manufacturer and distributor of fabricated metal products used in a variety of end markets such as industrial and commercial construction, highway and bridge construction, automotive and power generation. We operate 13 manufacturing facilities and 4 distribution centers throughout the United States and Canada giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service, and quality to a number of regional and national customers, and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America.
We manufacture an extensive variety of products that are sold through a number of sales channels including steel fabricators and distributors, as well as, commercial and transportation contractors.
Our product offerings include a full line of: expanded and perforated metal and plank grating used in walkways, catwalks, architectural facades, perimeter security barriers, shelving, and other applications where both visibility and security are necessary; fiberglass grating used in areas where high strength, light weight, low maintenance, corrosion resistance and non conductivity are required; and expansion joint systems, bearing assemblies, and pavement sealing systems used in bridges, elevated highways, airport runways, and rail crossings.
We strive to improve our offerings of industrial and infrastructure products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building code and regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to original equipment manufacturers and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include customized perforated and expanded metal to penetrate a range of new markets such as architectural facades for buildings (museums, sports stadiums and retail outlets) and perimeter security barriers for protecting critical infrastructure. In addition, we have extended our transportation infrastructure products into new markets. For example, long-lasting pavement sealants for roadways are now being installed on airport runways, structural bearings for elevated highways and bridges have been installed on an offshore oil production platform, and corrosion-protection products for cable-suspension bridges are now marketed and sold internationally.
Our production capabilities allow us to process a wide range of metals necessary for manufacturing industrial products. Most of our production is completed using computer numerical control ("CNC") machines, shears, slitters, press brakes, milling, welding, and numerous automated assembly machines. We maintain our equipment with a thorough preventive maintenance program, including in-house tool and die shops, allowing us to meet the demanding service requirements of many of our customers.
Renewable Energy and Conservation
The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment is primarily a designer and manufacturer of fully-engineered solutions for solar mounting systems and greenhouse structures. Our solar racking and greenhouse businesses employ a fully integrated approach with in-house engineering and design, fabrication, and installation capabilities. We have 7 manufacturing facilities and 2 distribution centers and operate in the United States, China and Japan. 
8

An integral part of each customer project is the fabrication of specifically designed metal structures for highly-engineered applications including: racking for ground-mounted solar arrays; racking for solar installations on rooftops of carports; as well as commercial-scale greenhouses and canopies. Both the solar racking and greenhouse projects involve holding glass and plastic to metal and use the same raw materials including steel and aluminum. Most of our production is completed using CNC machines, roll forming machines, laser cutters and other fabrication tools. The structural metal components are designed, fabricated and installed in accordance with applicable structural steel and aluminum guidelines.
We strive to improve our offerings of products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building codes and regulatory changes, and providing solutions to contractors and end users. New products introduced in recent years include metal framed canopy structures for car washes and pool enclosures, and solar racking systems for carports and canopies. Our car washes and canopy structures serve a market preference for light- transparent structures. Solar racking systems for carports serve as protection for cars from the effects of the sun and intense heat while providing a renewable energy resource. Similarly, solar racking systems installed on idle land, such as solid waste landfills, converts such land into a useful property by providing power generating capabilities.
Engineering and Technical Services
Our businesses employ engineers and other technical personnel to perform a variety of key tasks. These personnel staff fully-equipped, modern laboratories to support our operations. These laboratories enable us to verify, analyze, and document the physical, chemical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of our raw materials and products. In addition, our engineering staff employs a range of drafting software to design highly specialized and technically precise products. In our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, drawings are designed, signed and sealed by licensed engineers. Technical service personnel also work in conjunction with our sales force to determine the types of products and services that suit the particular needs of our customers.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Our business is required to maintain sufficient quantities of raw material inventory in order to accommodate our customers’ short lead times. Accordingly, we plan our purchases to maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers. We have implemented enterprise resource planning systems to better manage our inventory, forecast customer orders, enable efficient supply chain management, and allow for more timely counter-measures to changing customer demand and market conditions.
The primary raw materials we purchase are flat-rolled and plate steel, aluminum, and resins. We purchase flat-rolled and plate steel and aluminum at regular intervals on an as-needed basis, primarily from the major North American mills, as well as, a limited amount from domestic service centers and foreign steel importers. Substantially all of our resins are purchased from domestic vendors, primarily through distributors, with a small amount direct from manufacturers. Supply has historically been adequate from these sources to fulfill our needs. Because of our strategy to develop longstanding relationships in our supply chain, we have been able to adjust our deliveries of raw materials to match our required inventory positions to support our on-time deliveries to customers while allowing us to manage our investment in inventory and working capital.
The cost of our raw material purchases of steel, aluminum, and resins is significantly linked to commodity markets. The markets for commodities are highly cyclical and the costs of purchasing these raw materials can be volatile due to a number of factors including general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Changes in commodity costs not only impact the cost of our raw materials but also influence the prices we offer our customers. We have largely managed fluctuations in the market by maintaining lean inventory levels and increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing processes. However, in limited situations, where we have fixed price contracts to supply goods covering multiple quarters, we have used hedge contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in commodity costs.
We purchase natural gas and electricity from suppliers in proximity to our operations.
Even though we have long-term relationships with our suppliers, we have no long-term contractual commitments. Management continually examines and improves our purchasing practices across our geographically dispersed facilities in order to streamline purchasing across similar commodities.

Intellectual Property
We actively protect our proprietary rights by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. While we do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property is material, we believe our trademarks, copyrights, and patents provide us with a competitive advantage when marketing our products to customers. We also believe our brands are well recognized in the markets we serve and we believe they stand for high-quality manufactured goods at a competitive price. These trademarks, copyrights, and patent registrations allow us to help maintain product leadership positions for the goods we offer.
Sales and Marketing
Our products and services are sold primarily by channel partners who are called on by our sales personnel and outside sales representatives located throughout the United States, Canada and Asia. We have organized sales teams to focus on specific customers and national accounts through which we provide enhanced supply solutions and improve our ability to increase the number of products that we sell. Our sales staff works with certain retail customers to optimize shelf space for our products which is expected to increase sales at these locations. Our sales regularly involve competitive bidding processes, and our reputation for meeting delivery time lines and strict specifications make us a preferred provider for many customers.
We focus on providing our customers with industry leading customer service. Our business units generate numerous publications, catalogs, and other printed materials to facilitate the ordering process. In addition, we provide our retail customers with point-of-sale marketing aids to encourage consumer spending on our products in their stores. Continual communication with our customers allows us to understand their concerns and provides us with the opportunity to identify solutions that will meet their needs. We are able to meet our customers’ demand requirements due to our efficient manufacturing processes and extensive distribution network.
Customers and Distribution
Our customers are located primarily throughout North America and, to a lesser extent, Asia.
Our Residential Products segment operates principally in the North American residential new construction and repair and remodeling markets. A majority of our products are sold through sales channels to include home improvement retailers, building product distributors, residential contractors, and postal services distributors and providers.
Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment serves a variety of commercial construction markets; bridge and highway construction markets; and a variety of industrial markets. Discrete and process manufacturers, transportation contractors, and power generating utilities are major customers in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment.
Our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment primarily contracts with solar owners and developers, retail garden centers, conservatories and botanical gardens, commercial growers, and schools and universities.
One customer, a home improvement retailer which purchases from both the Residential Products segment and Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, represented 11% of our consolidated net sales for both 2016 and 2015, and 12% for 2014. No other customer in any segment accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.
Our products are distributed to our customers using common carriers and our own fleet of trucks. We maintain distribution centers that complement our manufacturing plants from which we ship products and ensure on-time delivery while maintaining efficiency within our distribution process.
Backlog
While the majority of our products have short lead time order cycles, we have aggregated approximately $116 million of backlog at December 31, 2016. The backlog primarily relates to certain business units in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products and our Renewable Energy and Conservation segments. We believe that the majority of our backlog will be shipped, completed and installed during 2017.
Competition
The Company operates in highly competitive markets. We compete against several competitors in all three of our segments with different competitors in each major product category. A few of our competitors may be larger, have greater financial resources, or have less financial leverage than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better positioned to respond to any downward pricing pressure or other adverse economic or industry conditions or to identify and acquire companies or product lines compatible with their business.
10

We compete with competitors based on the range of products offered, quality, price, and delivery, as well as, serving as a full service provider for project management in certain segments. Although some of our competitors are large companies, the majority are small to medium-sized and do not offer the large range of building products that we offer.
The prices paid for raw materials used in our operations, primarily steel, aluminum, and resins, are volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to demand, supply shortages, general industry and economic conditions, labor costs, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Although we have strategies to help mitigate the volatility in raw material costs, such as reducing inventory levels, our competitors who choose not to maintain inventories as large as ours may be better able to mitigate the effects of this volatility and, thereby, compete effectively against us on product price.
We believe our broad range of products, high quality, and sustained ability to meet exacting customer delivery requirements gives us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
Employees
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we employed 2,311 and 2,628 employees, respectively. We also employ a number of temporary employees to address peaks in staffing requirements. Approximately 11% of our workforce was represented by unions through various collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs") as of December 31, 2016. Three of the Company's six CBAs expired and were successfully renegotiated in 2016. None of our CBAs expire until April 30, 2018. We historically have had good relationships with our unions and we expect future negotiations with our unions to result in contracts that provide benefits that are consistent with those provided in our current agreements.
Seasonality
Our net sales and income are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters primarily due to the seasonality of construction activity. Our sales volume is driven by residential new build and renovation and other industrial construction activities which typically peak during warmer weather and decline due to inclement weather in the winter months. Operating margins are impacted by this seasonality because our operating costs have fixed cost components.
Governmental Regulation
Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are subject to many federal, state, and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment. Our production processes use some environmentally sensitive materials. For example, we lubricate our machines with oil and use oil baths to treat some of our products. While we cannot guarantee that we will not incur material expenses to comply with environmental requirements, we believe that we operate our business in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, do not anticipate any material expenditures to continue to meet environmental requirements, and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, we could incur operating costs or capital expenditures in complying with new or more stringent environmental requirements in the future or with current requirements if they are applied to our facilities in a way we do not anticipate. In addition, new or more stringent regulation of our energy suppliers could cause them to increase the price of energy.
Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations covering our labor relationships, the import and export of goods, the zoning of our facilities, taxes, our general business practices, and other matters. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
