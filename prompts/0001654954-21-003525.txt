 BUSINESS

 
  Overview
  
 TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”, “we” and “our”) is a global bacteria decontamination and infectious disease control company, providing environmental solutions for indoor surface decontamination through the manufacturing, sales, service and licensing of our SteraMist® brand of products, including SteraMist® BIT™, a low percentage (7.8%) hydrogen peroxide-based fog or mist that uses Binary Ionization Technology (BIT™).
  
 SteraMist® is a patented technology that produces ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (iHP™) using cold plasma science created under a grant by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Our EPA registered BIT™ Solution is composed of a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide converted to iHP™ after passing the trade secret blended solution, including its sole active ingredient of 7.8% hydrogen peroxide, through an atmospheric cold plasma arc. The newly formed iHP™ fog and mist consists of submicron to 3-micron radical particles that are carried throughout the treatment area in a fog or mist moving with the same velocity and characteristics of a gas. This allows the ionized hydrogen peroxide fog or mist to affect all surfaces and air space throughout the targeted treatment area, over, above and beyond the ability of manual cleaning processes. iHP™ damages pathogenic organisms through the oxidation of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. SteraMist® no-touch disinfection and or decontamination treat areas mechanically, causing cellular disruptions and/or dysfunctions resulting in a 6-log (99.9999%) and greater kill or inactivation of all pathogens in the treatment area.
  
 Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we were required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of disinfectants. In June 2015, SteraMist® BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and general broad-spectrum surface disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist® BIT™ now holds EPA registrations (# 90150-2) for mold control, and air and surface remediation (# 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include Clostridium difficile spores and MRSA, as well as the influenza virus h1n1, which we believe has better positioned us to penetrate all industries including the biodefense and healthcare industry. In August 2017, our EPA label was further expanded to include efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. As of January 27, 2017, our technology is one of 53 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List. Further, in December 2017, SteraMist® was included in the EPA’s list G (Norovirus), L (Ebola) and M (Avian Flu). In March 2020, our EPA label was further amended to include Emerging Viral Pathogens claims, thus meeting the criteria against Enveloped viruses and Large Non-enveloped viruses and included on List N (Emerging Viral Pathogens including SARS-CoV-2).

 SteraMist® Binary Ionization Technology® allows a facility to have a mechanical method of cleaning using a Hospital-HealthCare disinfectant which is an EPA registered tool and solution to replace flawed manual cleaning technology, upgrade existing protocols, and limit liability in a facility when it comes to resistant infectious pathogens. SteraMist® BIT™ is the first EPA registered solution and system combination on the market. We maintain this registration in 50 states, Canada, and approximately thirty-five (35) other countries.
  
  Our Technology
  
 BIT™ was developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist (0.3-3 um in diameter) that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals (“OH”). ROS cause damage to pathogenic and resistant organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, viruses, mold spores, other fungi and yeast, via oxidation of proteins carbohydrates, lipids and rendering the building blocks of nature’s amino acids, DNA and RNA inactive - leading to cellular death, disruption and/or dysfunction.
  
 Testing detailed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense demonstrated these hydroxyl radicals aggressively break the double bonds and other bonds in bacterial spores, biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after our EPA-registered solution passes through an atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result - our  .OH hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as iHP™. This patented process allows these hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity, while seeking to attach with any and all surfaces within the proximity of TOMI’s mist.
  
 The sole active ingredient of BIT™ is a low percentage (7.8%) Hydrogen Peroxide and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist® brand of products. Our technology produces a germ-killing aerosol that moves throughout a space like a gas. Our technology is able to efficiently and effectively kill pathogenic and resistant organisms in the air and on the surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water in the form of humidity.
  
 Each and every SteraMist® product utilizes the innovative and easy-to-use power of Binary Ionization Technology which is designed to be easily incorporated into any industry’s current cleaning procedures. No wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy, quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and a submicron particle allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.
  
 SteraMist® is being used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Clostridium difficile, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”), Ebola (“Ebola”) and SARS CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID. In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist® is being used for terminal cleaning, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of Clostridium difficile spore rates. SteraMist® has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at large hospital to small clinics and has contributed to the control of MERS, Ebola and COVID throughout the world.
  
 Although a technology developed to combat the hardest to kill pathogens and neutralize the most difficult chemical agents, TOMI’s customer base fought at the front lines of combating the current pandemic of Coronavirus or SARS CoV-2 in 2020.
  
 Our technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is the laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including weaponized anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.
  
 All our SteraMist® products are fully validated to comply with good manufacturing practice standards, have received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our solution is manufactured at an EPA-registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by good laboratory practice efficacy data for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Norovirus, SARS CoV-2, mold spores, MRSA, h1n1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium difficile spores.

 Industries & Market Segments
  
 All the above product offerings help our customers create a healthier world by providing them a significant opportunity to help reduce the spread of Community Associated Infections (“CAI’s”) and Healthcare-Acquired Infections (“HAI’s”) and the most lethal of pathogens including our recent SARS CoV-2 pandemic and future pandemics.
  
 SteraMist® and TOMI’s related service platforms are currently being used in a broad spectrum of industries and has the ability to fit into any cleaning protocol. We have categorized these industries into five (5) divisions: Hospital-HealthCare, Life Sciences, TOMI Service Network (TSN), Food Safety, and our Commercial division.
  
 Hospital-HealthCare. Our SteraMist® Surface Unit and SteraMist® Total Disinfection Cart are solutions to aid our Hospital-HealthCare customers in providing the quality of care and safety they provide to their patients by disinfecting patient and operating rooms, pharmacies, ambulances, and emergency environments in a hospital or healthcare facility. Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and troubleshoot capital equipment throughout the world for our Hospital-HealthCare customers.
  
 We continue to penetrate the hospital-healthcare market segment, and under the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, hospitals that have high rates of infections and HAIs are facing significant financial penalties. Our SteraMist® BIT™ technology has proven to reduce the transference spread of infections leading to an overall reduction in the number of patients being infected as a result of the historic poor manual cleaning of these patient rooms, infectious disease rooms and operatory suites, with a corresponding return on investment to the hospital of up to 20-to-1 in the first year.
  
 Life Sciences. Our SteraMist® line of products is a decontamination solution to use sites in this industry, specifically pharmaceutical (compounding and manufacturing), vivariums, research universities, BSLs (biological safety labs) 1, 2, 3 and 4 level, BSC’s (biological safety chambers), isolators, cage washers, and cleanrooms. With proper implementation of SteraMist®, all facilities can reduce the risk of infectious as well as potentially infectious agents and/or materials, which facilities such as these handle on a routine basis.
  
 There are many requirements and restrictions on the type of decontamination agents our Life Sciences customers may use to prevent these risks and remediate adverse incidents. In light of these regulations, our rapid deployment of our effective iHP™ aerosolized mist is the solution to lower risks, reduce damage to expensive laboratory equipment and furniture, eliminate other labor intense procedures, and perform decontamination clean-up in these spaces quickly, less caustically, requiring no wipe and with no residue. By using iHP technology these most important facilities are able to perform more experiments a year due to the effective quick treatment that iHP offers.
  
 Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and troubleshoot capital equipment globally for our Life Sciences customers. Further, our iHP™ Corporate Service decontamination team provides routine and emergency treatment. TOMI’s iHP™ service team also does commissioning and decommissioning of facilities equipment or full complete space decontamination for new and existing customers.
  
 The TOMI Service Network. The TSN, has allowed us to enhance our corporate service division by creating a multi-nation-wide network composed of existing, full-service specialists. Since the launch of TSN, we have added two hundred (200) service partner companies across the United States and Canada. These are professional first responders that specialize within the mold remediation, hurricane and tornado response and other mitigation fields, biohazard specialists including forensic restoration specialists.

  These professional servicing specialists (TSN partners) focus their businesses in the commercial and residential space. Our team of customer experience managers and our training department maintains and troubleshoots capital equipment for these individuals with the goal of implementing servicing procedures and protocols throughout the United States and Canada for our TSN network partners. Members are provided access to 24/7 support in marketing their iHP service divisions and landing webpage connected to tomimist.com.
  
 Food Safety Industry. SteraMist® aerosolizing cold plasma technology is an effective decontaminant in the food safety industry. According to the CDC, 80 million people per year in the United States contract, and 5,000 people die from, food poisoning or other food-related illnesses. Current food safety cleaning techniques involve time intensive processes, which can reduce food manufacturers’ profit. Our iHP™ degrades into only harmless water (humidity) and oxygen. We have applied for approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), when approved we anticipate that our solution can be applied directly to all foods. Currently we use SteraMist® on food packing, processing and storage equipment as SteraMist® is safe for use on electronics and kitchenware, along with high touch surfaces where most pathogens are found (such as phones, computers and kitchen appliances). We believe that SteraMist® could be useful for decontamination at all phases of food production, from the farm, slaughterhouse, packaging and canning facilities, food storage locations to the transportation of food and to the restaurants and grocery stores.
  
 Commercial. TOMI commercial division addresses the viral pathogens threat to everyday operations. We bring powerful disinfection and decontamination to a wide array of industries with computability in endless use sites, from large-scale land, sea, and air transportation to county and state emergency facilities to retail and educational facilities. Our commercial customers have the goal to keep employees and first responders healthy while maintaining operations.
  
 Homeland defense and border protection is a subspecialty of our commercial division. Countries around the world, including the United States, need to protect their borders and cities against a potential terrorist attack. Our SteraMist® line of products will give governmental bodies an added tool in their arsenal to mitigate the risk of a weaponized biological and chemical attack. In addition, SteraMist® could assist in mitigating the spread of emerging pandemic viruses, including strains of Ebola, MERS, MLAV (filovirus), and influenza virus subtypes like h1n1, h5n1, h7n9 and h10n8. Our SteraMist® line of products may assist border patrol agents in controlling the spread of infectious disease introduced by foreign individuals by decontaminating interview rooms, containment rooms, holding cells and quarantine areas after a potential infected carrier’s condition either improves or the carrier dies.

  Competition
  
 The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is extremely competitive and highly regulated. Competition is intense in all five (5) of our divisions and includes many large and small competitors.
  
 Our competitors include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide-based products, such as Steris Corporation (“Steris”), Bioquell, Inc. (“Bioquell”) currently owned by Ecolab, Inc. (“Ecolab”) and The Clorox Company (“Clorox”), various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. During 2020 due to the COVID outbreak, new competitors that manufacture and sell Electrostatic Sprayers and biostatic protectants, specifically to the Commercial industry, entered the market.
  
 We believe our SteraMist® suite of products have a competitive advantage to our competitor’s products in that they are quicker and less caustic, provides a six log kill to a wide variety of pathogens and leave no residue or unpleasant odor. However, some of these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us.
  
 We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the service. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
  
 We believe that our growth in these industries as a leading global disinfection/decontamination company depends on our abilities to discover, develop, market, and innovate, disruptive cost-effective products and services.
  
  Competitive Advantages
  
  We believe the SteraMist® technology has many advantages over its competition. Our technology can turn over a space to an end-user far faster than its competition. Our technology requires limited preparation to an area compared to our competitors and does not rely on fans or any outside force to move throughout a space. Our “.OH” is the smallest submicron 0.3-3-micron particle that receives a charge and can move around an area like a gas, going above, below, and beyond the hardest to reach areas.
  
 Another key and critical advantage is the technology’s superior material compatibility. The hydroxyl radical allowing to kill on contact and leave no dangerous byproducts in the areas being treated.  It is important the world is educated and aware of the harsh chemicals that exist on the market, and used with Electrostatic Sprayers, as they will not ensure proper efficacy on the surface being treated as even if the chemical is EPA registered, it may not be compatible with the sprayer.  For example, the sprayer may not be spraying enough of the chemical to kill the virus or the bacteria, in addition to a lot of these harsh chemicals and sprayers are destroying materials and equipment over time, ending to be a much more costly product.
  
 It is our position there is no other product on the market like SteraMist. A technology that can treat almost 4,000 cubic feet in 45 minutes with a contact time of only 15 minutes or spray surfaces 5 seconds per square foot with no wet time.  A technology with all the competitive advantages required in disinfection, where other disinfectants will have a select few.  No wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy (developed by DARPA for Anthrax spores), quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and our submicron particles which moves like a gas allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.
  
 In summary, SteraMist® offers the following competitive advantages:
  
  ●
Provides a 99.9999% or six-log kill and above kill (i.e., the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores) on all challenged pathogens, on multiple surfaces including Bacillus atrophaeus spores, Bacillus subtilis spores and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, the spore that is considered a gold standard for validation of sterilization versus household/industrial cleaners that offer a 99.9% (sanitizing) or three-log kill to 99.99% (disinfection) or four-log kill.

  ●
Easy to use.

  ●
