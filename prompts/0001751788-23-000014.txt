Current and Future Investments
The Company has announced investments that are being progressed over the next several years and are expected to enhance competitiveness. These include:
•Construction of a world-scale polyethylene unit on the U.S. Gulf Coast based on Dow’s proprietary process technologies, to meet consumer-driven demand in specialty packaging, health and hygiene, and industrial and consumer packaging applications.
•Construction of the world's first net-zero carbon emissions (with respect to Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide ("CO2") emissions, including technology advancements) ethylene and derivatives complex in Alberta, Canada.
•Plans to construct a clean hydrogen plant where by-products from core production processes would be converted into hydrogen and CO2. The CO2 would be captured and stored until alternative technologies develop. Dow will also look for ways to enable usage of the CO2 in its processes rather than storing it. The hydrogen plant would allow Dow's Terneuzen manufacturing site to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 1.4 million metric tons per year.
•Dow previously signed several renewable and cleaner power agreements which are expected to reduce Scope 2 emissions by more than 600,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year.
•Ongoing collaboration with Mura Technology (“Mura”) to help solve the global plastics waste issue and advance circularity via circular feedstocks, which are converted into recycled plastics. Mura plans to construct a new facility at Dow's Böhlen site in Germany, the latest in a series of planned facilities across the U.S. and Europe to rapidly scale advanced recycling of plastics, and the first expected to be based at a Dow site. This project is targeted for a final investment decision by the end of 2023. This would position Dow to become the largest consumer of circular feedstock for polyethylene production globally.
The Company's ambition includes becoming the most sustainable materials science company, with a strategy to advance the well-being of humanity by helping lead the transition to a sustainable planet and society. This includes lowering energy and greenhouse gas emissions and further enabling a shift to a circular economy for plastics by focusing on resource efficiency and integrating recycled content and renewable feedstocks into its production processes. As part of that strategy, Dow announced the following in 2022:
•In the fourth quarter of 2022, Dow commissioned the retrofit of its first UNIFINITYTM Fluidized Catalytic Dehydrogenation ("FCDh") technology for cost-advantaged, on-purpose propylene manufacturing and continues to successfully cross all critical startup milestones and make strong progress toward production of on-spec propylene at scale. The FCDh unit, located at one of Dow's mixed-feed crackers in Plaquemine, Louisiana, will ultimately enable production of approximately 150,000 metric tons of additional on-purpose propylene at full run-rate. The breakthrough propylene manufacturing technology, which Dow will license through Univation Technologies, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, can reduce capital outlay by up to 25 percent while lowering energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 percent. This project was originally announced in 2019.
•Acceleration of the Company's sustainability targets set in 2020 by expanding its stop the waste target to a transform the waste target. By 2030, Dow will transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstock to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable plastics solutions annually. 
•Launched a new collaboration with Waste Management ("WM") to improve residential recycling for hard-to-recycle plastic films by allowing consumers in select markets to recycle these materials directly in their curbside recycling. Once operating at full capacity, this program is expected to help WM divert more than 120,000 metric tons of plastics film from landfills annually. Dow will support this initiative by incorporating recycled content into its product solutions, in line with the Company’s goals.
•Signed an agreement with French recycling company Valoregen to contribute to building the largest single hybrid recycling site in France, to be owned and operated by Valoregen. The project, which is expected to be operational and delivering recycled materials in the first half of 2023, will mark an important step in bringing together mechanical recycling (which processes certain plastic waste into secondary products) and newer, advanced recycling processes (which breaks down mixed, hard-to-recycle plastics into their original naphtha-like liquid form to manufacture new virgin-like polymers). Dow will be the main recipient of Valoregen’s post-consumer resins, which it will use to develop new plastic products marketed under Dow’s REVOLOOP™ product range. It will also support the development of Valoregen's recycling technology capabilities. 
•Invested in Plastogaz SA, a technology start-up and proprietor of an advanced recycling technology, which will help to simplify the process of converting plastic waste to feedstock and provide another carbon-efficient option to keep plastic waste out of landfills and the environment. Dow will bring global reach and materials science expertise to further develop technologies with companies, like Plastogaz, who are developing circular feedstock for plastics. 
•Invested in Mr. Green Africa, the first recycling company in Africa to be a Certified B Corporation, to enable further diversion of plastic waste from informal dumpsites and the environment, drive positive change in local communities, address inadequacies in existing waste management systems and close the loop on plastics waste across Africa. The investment marks the first of its kind from Dow on the continent and expects to enable approximately 90,000 metric tons of plastic waste to be recovered over four years and recycled into new packaging applications. 
•Signed a letter of intent with X-energy, a nuclear energy innovation company which will help Dow advance its carbon emissions reduction goals through the development and deployment of X-energy's advanced small modular nuclear technology in the United States.
•Signed a definitive agreement to take a minority stake in the Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH ("HEH") and is working with HEH's current members to advance Germany's capabilities to import supplies of liquified natural gas, bio-liquified natural gas and synthetic natural gas through the construction of an import terminal. The HEH consortium is planning to build, own, and operate an import terminal for liquified gases on Dow's Stade, Germany industrial park. The zero-carbon emission terminal will be co-located with Dow's facilities in Stade. Dow is making land available for the construction of the terminal as well as infrastructure services, off-gas heat, site services and mutual harbor use rights.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
Dow is working to deliver a sustainable future by collaborating and innovating to expand its ability to make a positive impact on society and the planet. As a leading materials science company, Dow has the responsibility and opportunity to act and lead the industry in areas where Dow's science and innovation can make a difference. This means Dow is reducing its environmental footprint, developing and implementing circular economy solutions, and creating new materials that are more sustainable. Dow’s sustainability strategy focuses on three areas, which address some of the most pressing challenges facing the planet and offer the most opportunity for Dow to use its science and global scale to make a positive impact.
Climate Protection – Dow is committed to protecting the planet by combating climate change, including contributing to a lower-carbon future, both in its operations and value chains. Dow’s comprehensive strategy includes actions to optimize the Company's manufacturing facilities and processes for sustainability, increase clean energy in Dow's purchased power mix, collaborate with the Company's supply chain to address upstream carbon emissions, invest in transformative next-generation solutions for climate protection, and develop low carbon products, technologies and services.
Circular Economy – Dow is taking a leading role in driving a more circular economy by designing for circularity, transforming plastic waste and alternative feedstock into circular and renewable solutions, building new business models for circular materials, and partnering in an industrial ecosystem to end plastic waste. 
Safer Materials – Dow is innovating new materials that offer a more favorable health and environmental profile over their life cycles compared to incumbent solutions. Dow believes that creating safer materials is a continuous journey and is possible through innovation, design and more predictive, enabling technologies. Dow’s innovations must meet the needs of customers and society, and Dow is committed to continue to evolve its approach to safer materials in line with these expectations.
Climate Protection, Circular Economy and Safer Materials are critical to Dow’s license to operate and represent areas where Dow is using its science, scale and global relationships across value chains to create shared opportunity for Dow and society. To accelerate the Company's sustainability commitments, Dow has implemented and continues to expand on its multi-decade targets intended to put the Company on a path to achieve carbon neutrality and eliminate plastic waste, which include the following:
•By 2030, Dow will reduce its net annual Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons compared with its 2020 baseline, representing a 15 percent reduction from 2020 and a 30 percent reduction since 2005.
•By 2050, Dow intends to be carbon neutral (Scope 1+2+3 plus product benefits). 
•By 2030, Dow will transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstock to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually. To do this, Dow will expand its efforts to stop the waste by building industrial ecosystems to collect, reuse or recycle waste and expand its portfolio to meet rapidly growing demand. Dow expects the waste required to produce this target will surpass and replace its original 1 million metric tons stop the waste goal.
The Company's progress in achieving these targets is reviewed regularly by management and with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Dow Inc. Board of Directors ("Board"). 
Additional discussion of matters pertaining to the environment, including actions related to the Company's sustainability strategy, is included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7.

HUMAN CAPITAL
Dow’s ambition – to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world - starts with people. Dow employees create innovative and sustainable materials science solutions to advance the world. Every answer starts with asking the right questions. This is why the diverse, dedicated Dow team collaborates with customers and other stakeholders to find solutions to the world's toughest challenges. The Company's values of Respect for People, Integrity and Protecting Our Planet are fundamental beliefs that are ingrained in each action taken, can never be compromised and are the foundation of the Company's Code of Conduct.
The Company is dedicated to employee health and safety and is invested in fostering a culture of inclusion and continuous learning while supporting its employees through its Total Rewards plans and programs to ensure all Dow employees are respected, valued and encouraged to make their fullest contribution. 
Safety, Employee Health and Well-Being
A commitment to safety and employee health is ingrained in Dow’s culture and central to how the Dow team works. Dow uses a comprehensive, integrated operating discipline management system that includes policies, requirements, best practices and procedures associated with health and safety. In 2022, the Company achieved an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Injury and Illness Rate of 0.16, based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours for employees and contractors globally. This measure, along with a consistent set of globally applied, as well as locally defined, leading indicators of safety performance, are cornerstones of Dow's worker protection program. The Company maintains a robust, globally tracked near-miss program for situations that did not result in an injury, but could have been high consequence had circumstances been slightly different. This data is reviewed regularly by management and the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Board, is visible to all employees and is built into digital dashboards that include actual injury information for every Dow location around the world. 
As part of the Company’s total worker health strategy, employees have access to occupational health services at no cost through on-site, Company-managed clinics at its manufacturing locations or an offsite provider overseen by Dow Occupational Health. In addition to access for occupational health needs, the Company also has a comprehensive well-being strategy, which is framed across four dimensions – physical, mental, community and financial well-being – for an approach that is holistic, global, employee centered and outcome-driven. Key ambitions 
across the four dimensions focus on elements such as workplace stress, psychological safety, resiliency, workload, healthy eating and activities, and social community and inclusion opportunities.
Dow maintains active Crisis Management Teams at the corporate level and in each region where the Company operates to ensure appropriate plans are in place in the event of natural disasters or other emergencies.
Inclusion, Diversity & Equity
At Dow, inclusion, diversity and equity (“ID&E”) is a business imperative evidenced by inclusion serving as a core pillar of the Company's ambition statement. A strategic and intentional focus on ID&E not only enhances the employee experience and satisfaction, but it also supports innovation, customer experience and understanding of the communities the Company serves. In 2022, Dow advanced to #15 in the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity and for the second year in a row was named to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. These are significant accomplishments that represent only two of the many awards the Company received related to its efforts in ID&E. 
Dow's strategic ID&E efforts are directed by its Chief Inclusion Officer and Office of Inclusion, which supports implementation throughout Dow’s businesses, functions and regions. Three Inclusion Councils drive the ID&E strategy from the top of the Company down and across the enterprise:
•The President’s Inclusion Council defines and supports Dow's ID&E strategy from the top.
•A Senior Leaders’ Inclusion Council influences change through senior and mid-level business, geographic and functional leaders.
•A Joint Inclusion Council collaborates to drive maximum employee engagement through Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) leadership. 
Dow’s 10 ERGs are representative of the Company’s diverse workforce and help foster an inclusive workplace. Dow’s ERGs are organized around historically underrepresented groups including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities and veterans, as well as groups both for professionals who are new to the Company and those who are 50 years or older. Senior leaders serve as executive sponsors for each ERG. In addition, Dow has a Paid Time Off Policy which provides employees time off to volunteer and engage in ERG activities. In 2022, 57 percent of Dow’s workforce and 98 percent of Dow people leaders participated in at least one ERG. 
Inclusion and diversity metrics, including ERG participation, global representation of women and U.S. ethnic minority representation in the United States, are published internally on a quarterly basis, are embedded in the same scorecard where Dow’s financial and safety results are measured and are directly connected to leaders’ annual performance and compensation. This data is reviewed regularly by management and with the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board.
Global pay disparity studies have been conducted at Dow for over 20 years to assess fair treatment between genders and between U.S. ethnic minorities and non-minorities and to ensure Dow’s pay practices are being implemented as intended. As part of Dow’s ID&E efforts, the Company will continue to conduct annual pay gap studies and actively engage with an external partner to further develop and continue to apply best practices.
Total Rewards
To achieve Dow’s ambition to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world, the Company invests in its people, who are at the heart of the Company, through its Total Rewards plans and programs. The Total Rewards plans and programs are structured to attract, retain and motivate Dow’s employees. Dow’s Total Rewards are designed to support all aspects of its employees – their compensation, future, health, life and career. The Company is committed to aligning its strategy and culture with the needs of its employees and optimizing the investment Dow makes in Total Rewards. 
As a global company with a diverse team, Dow aims to ensure employees have access to resources that allow them to meet their unique needs. That is why Dow has established three guiding principles that define its Total Rewards strategy: 1) ensuring programs are market competitive, while leading peer companies in equitable and inclusive offerings; 2) providing employees with offerings that align with their preferences; and 3) offering programs that promote fulfilling career and life experiences. Dow adapts its programs for geography-specific requirements, as well as cultural standards and expectations.
Employee Engagement, Learning and Development
Throughout an employee’s career, the Company supports development through a blend of learning approaches including in-person and virtual trainings, digital learning platforms, on-the-job training and a series of leadership development programs. Annually, all employees have the opportunity to provide feedback on employee experience and offer insights into how to improve Dow’s working culture through a global employee opinion survey. A key component of the survey is an opportunity for employees to provide feedback on the effectiveness of their direct leader. In 2022, 72 percent of employees responded to the annual survey. The feedback received through this annual survey and additional quarterly checkpoint surveys is used to drive actions to improve the overall Dow experience for employees across the Company, as well as to support continuous improvement in leader effectiveness.
At December 31, 2022, the Company permanently employed approximately 37,800 people on a full-time basis. 
 

* | U.S. Minority includes employees who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or two or more races. Employees who self-identify as White are considered U.S. Non-Minority.
