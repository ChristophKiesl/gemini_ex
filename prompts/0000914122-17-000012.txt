Item 1. BUSINESS
As of January 31, 2017, Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries ("PPIH", "Company" or "Registrant"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in one reportable segment: Piping Systems. In February 2017, the Company announced that the board of directors had authorized Company management to move forward with the re-naming and re-branding of MFRI, Inc. under the Perma-Pipe name now that the Company operates in a single business segment under the Perma-Pipe brand, and the Company believes this decision will better serve its strategy, position it well in the industry and global market,and better reflect the Company’s mission and strategy, and positions it to leverage the strong reputation Perma-Pipe has established since beginning operations. The name change to Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. was effective March 20, 2017. The Company's common stock has been and will continue to be reported under its new ticker symbol “PPIH” since March 21, 2017. Outstanding stock certificates are not affected by the symbol change and will not need to be exchanged. The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. Years and balances described as 2016 and 2015 are the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
On January 29, 2016, the Company sold certain assets and liabilities of its TDC Filter business based in Bolingbrook, Illinois to the Industrial Air division of CLARCOR, Inc. On January 29, 2016, the Company also sold its Nordic Air Filtration, Denmark and Nordic Air Filtration, Middle East businesses to Hengst Holding GmbH. The aggregated sales price of these filtration businesses was $22.0 million, including cash proceeds of $18.4 million, of which $0.5 million is held in escrow until July 2017. In 2016, the Company sold the remaining assets of the facilities for $3.7 million in cash after expenses and mortgage payoffs.
In addition to paying down debt, the sale of the filtration business gave the Company the opportunity to focus resources on new Piping Systems growth opportunities such as the recent acquisition of 100% ownership of Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. ("PPC"), which the Company believes creates a strong platform to diversify and expand Perma-Pipe Inc.’s ("Perma-Pipe") business into new markets and geographies.
In connection with its strategic repositioning, the Company has reorganized the Company’s corporate staff and reducing expenses to reflect its new strategic focus and structure. Changes to several senior executive positions went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2016, as previously disclosed. The Company believes these changes may yield annualized savings of approximately $1.2 million.
On January 31, 2017, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales. On January 31, 2016, one customer accounted for 10.3% of the Company's net sales.

Two customers accounted for 33.2% of accounts receivable on January 31, 2017, and two customers accounted for 46.5% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2016. As of April 1, 2017, these customers have paid 35.4% of their receivables outstanding on January 31, 2017.

Piping Systems
Products and services. The Company engineers, designs, manufactures and sells specialty piping and leak detection and location systems. Piping Systems include (i) industrial and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (ii) insulated and jacketed piping systems for district heating and cooling ("DHC"), Municipal Freeze Protection, Oil & Gas, Mining and Industrial applications, (iii) insulation for subsea oil and gas gathering flowlines and equipment, (iv) above and below ground long lines for oil and mineral transportation and (v) anti-corrosion coatings for oil and gas distribution and gathering pipelines.  The leak detection and location systems are sold with some of its piping systems and also on a stand-alone basis to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property.
Piping Systems frequently engineers and custom fabricates to job site dimensions and incorporates provisions for thermal expansion due to varying temperatures. This custom fabrication helps to minimize the amount of field labor required by the installation contractor. Most of the piping systems are produced for underground installations and, therefore, require trenching, which is the responsibility of the general contractor, and done by unaffiliated installation contractors.
The Piping Systems segment is based on large discrete projects, and domestic Piping Systems is seasonal. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") - Piping Systems."
Recent developments. In February 2017, the Company announced that a Perma-Pipe subsidiary has formed a consortium with Danish company LOGSTOR, A/S to bid the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline ("EACOP") project. This consortium joins the leading pre-insulated piping manufacturers in North America and Europe to take advantage of their combined fabrication, engineering and material science expertise.
The EACOP project is a 1450 Km (900 mile) long heavy crude oil pipeline from the Lake Albert Basin in Uganda to the Tanga port in Tanzania being developed by French oil company Total E&P, China National Offshore Oil 
 2

Corporation (CNOOC) and London-based Tullow Oil. The pipeline is 24 inches in diameter, and is electrically heat traced. It will be the longest insulated and heat traced pipeline in the world. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its bid for this project, or the terms of any such potential engagement.
Customers. The customer base is industrially and geographically diverse. In the United States of America ("U.S."), the Company employs national and regional sales managers who use and assist a network of independent manufacturers' representatives, none of whom sells products that are competitive with the Company's Piping Systems. The Company employs a direct sales force as well as an exclusive agent network in Canada, the U.S. and for several countries in the Middle and Far East to market and sell products and services.
Intellectual property. The Company owns several patents covering its piping and electronic leak detection systems. The patents are not material either individually or in the aggregate overall, because the Company believes sales would not be materially reduced if patent protection were not available. The Company owns numerous trademarks connected with its piping and leak detection systems including the following U.S. trademarks: Perma-Pipe®, Chil-Gard®, Double Quik®, Escon-A®, FluidWatch®, Galva-Gard®, Polytherm®, Pal-AT®, Stereo-Heat®, LiquidWatch®, PalCom®, Xtru-therm®, Auto-Therm®, Pex-Gard®, Multi-Therm®, Ultra-Therm®, Cryo-Gard®, Sleeve-Gard®, Electro-Gard® and Sulphur-Therm®. The Company also owns a number of trademarks throughout the world. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include: Auto-Therm®, Cryo-Gard®, Electro-Gard®, Sleeve-Gard®, Permalert®, Pal-AT®, Perma-Pipe®, Polytherm®, Ric-Wil®, and Xtru-therm®.
Raw materials. Basic raw materials used in production are pipes and tubes made of carbon steel, alloy, copper, ductile iron, plastics and various chemicals such as polyols, isocyanate, urethane resin, polyethylene and fiberglass, mostly purchased in bulk quantities. The Company believes there are currently adequate supplies and sources of availability of these needed raw materials.
The sensor cables used in the leak detection and location systems are manufactured to the Company's specifications by companies regularly engaged in manufacturing such cables. The Company owns patents for some of the features of its sensor cables. The Company assembles the monitoring component of the leak detection and location systems from components purchased from many sources.
Competition. Piping Systems is highly competitive, and the Company believes its principal competition consists of between ten and twenty major competitors and more small competitors. The Company believes quality, service, engineering design and support, a comprehensive product line and price are key competitive factors. The Company also believes it has a more comprehensive line for DHC than any competitor. Some competitors have greater financial resources and cost advantages as a result of manufacturing a limited range of products.
Government regulation. The demand for the Company's leak detection and location systems and secondary containment piping systems, a small percentage of the total annual piping sales, is driven by federal and state environmental regulation with respect to hazardous waste. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires, in some cases, that the storage, handling and transportation of fluids through underground pipelines feature secondary containment and leak detection. The National Emission Standard for hydrocarbon airborne particulates requires reduction of airborne volatile organic compounds and fugitive emissions. Under this regulation, many major refineries are required to recover fugitive vapors and dispose of the recovered material in a process sewer system, which then becomes a hazardous secondary waste system that must be contained. Although there can be no assurances as to the ultimate effects of these governmental regulations, the Company believes such regulations may increase the demand for its Piping Systems products.

Filtration Products
Products and services. Prior to January 29, 2016, the Company manufactured and sold a wide variety of filter elements for cartridge collectors and baghouse air filtration and particulate collection systems. The principal types of industrial air filtration and particulate collection systems in use are baghouses, cartridge collectors, electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers and mechanical collectors. This equipment was used to eliminate particulates from the air by passing particulate laden gases through fabric filters (filter bags) or pleated media filter elements, in the case of baghouses or cartridge collectors. The Company manufactured filter elements in standard industry sizes, shapes and filtration media and to custom specifications, maintaining manufacturing standards for more than 10,000 styles of filter elements to suit substantially all industrial applications. Filter elements were manufactured from industrial yarn, fabric and paper purchased in bulk. Most filter elements were produced from cellulose, acrylic, fiberglass, polyester, aramid, laminated membranes, or polypropylene fibers.
The Company marketed numerous filter related products and accessories used during the installation, operation and maintenance of cartridge collectors and baghouses, including wire cages used to support filter bags, spring assemblies for proper tensioning of filter bags and clamps and hanger assemblies for attaching filter elements. In addition, the Company marketed hardware items used in the operation and maintenance of cartridge collectors and baghouses. The Company also provided maintenance services, consisting primarily of air filtration system inspection and filter element replacement, using a network of independent contractors.
Customers. The customer base was industrially and geographically diverse. These products and services were used primarily by operators of utility and industrial coal-fired boilers, incinerators and cogeneration plants and by producers of metals, cement, chemicals and other industrial products.
Filtration Products were marketed domestically under the names Midwesco Filter and TDC Filter Manufacturing. The Denmark filtration facility marketed pleated filter elements under the name Nordic Filtration throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, primarily to original equipment manufacturers.
