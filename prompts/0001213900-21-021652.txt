Jin You Wei Meng (Shenzhen) Consulting Company Limited (“JYWM WFOE”) was established as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise on November 24, 2020, under the laws of the PRC. It is 100% owned by WLJM HK.
 
Shenzhen Wei Lian Jin Meng Electronic Commerce Limited (“Shenzhen Wei Lian”) was incorporated on October 17, 2017, under the laws of the PRC. It is 100% owned by JYWM WFOE.

The Company, through our subsidiaries, develops, produces, markets and sells “coffee tea” products, which represent drinks made from a mixture of coffee and tea, as well as black coffee products and other coffee products. We sell our products wholesale to retail partners and corporate customers, and we also sell directly to consumers in the PRC via our e-commerce channels. We adopted the “online to offline”, or O2O sales mode (i.e. selling products online and delivering products through offline channels), committing to building the first brand of “coffee tea” culture in the PRC.
 
Suppliers and Vendors
 
We have a limited number of suppliers for our raw materials and logistics service. In 2019 and 2020, we purchased our coffee beans mainly from one supplier and our tea leaves mainly from one supplier. We also cooperate with three different delivery service providers from warehouses to our customers.  We maintain good relationships with our suppliers, and as of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any material disputes or supply shortages.
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Our Position in the Industry
 
Chinese consumers are already familiar with tea, a traditional Chinese drink. Our “coffee tea” products are aimed at attracting Chinese consumers who are also interested in coffee. Our black coffee products and other coffee products are also targeting coffee consumers in China.
 
Our commitment to quality is uncompromising. We source premium Arabica coffee beans from coffee plantations covering 500,000 mu (approximately 82,368 acres or 129 square miles) in Yunnan Province that are located between 15 degrees north latitude and the Tropic of Cancer—an ideal area for coffee growth. Most of this production area is between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level. The terrain is mainly mountainous and sloping land with large fluctuations, fertile soil, ample sunshine, abundant rainfall, and the day and night temperature difference is large. All of these unique natural conditions make our Arabian coffee beans taste strong but not bitter, fragrant but not strong, and slightly fruity. We believe that such coffee beans are favored by mainstream Chinese coffee consumers. 
 
We maintain good relationships with our suppliers, and as of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any material disputes or supply shortages.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) as we do not have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2020, our last fiscal year. We are electing to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,070,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act.
 
Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as, among other possible qualifications, a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
