Item 1 Business
Our Company 



We are a blank check company newly incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering. We have not selected any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.



Our sponsor is affiliated with Lead Edge, a growth equity investment firm based in New York, NY and Santa Barbara, CA which has raised $3 billion in capital since inception. Lead Edge’s primary business is investing in public and private software, Internet and technology-enabled services companies globally. Mitchell H. Green, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the founder and Managing Partner of Lead Edge. Nimay Mehta, our President and CFO, and Brian Neider, our Chief Operating Officer, are General Partners at Lead Edge and members the Investment Committee for all Lead Edge funds.



Our objective is to pursue opportunities with high-quality software, Internet and technology-enabled companies. We believe the combination of experience in sourcing, investing, product and operating uniquely position our team to execute on a compelling business combination.



Founded in 2012, Lead Edge has experience investing at the intersection of public and private companies in the broader technology sector, having invested in companies such as Alibaba Group, Ant Financial, Asana, Bazaarvoice, Delivery Hero, Duo Security, Marketo, Mindbody, Red Ventures, Spotify, Toast, TransferWise, Uber and Xamarin.



Lead Edge differentiates itself from other firms by offering entrepreneurs a model for value creation through its strategic limited partner (“LP”) base of more than 500 successful executives and entrepreneurs, to seek to drive value to its portfolio companies and prospective investments. These LPs are geographically diverse and represent a wide range of functional skillsets across different industries.



The Lead Edge investment team takes a proactive approach to sourcing prospective investments, using proprietary technology tools to enable conversations with thousands of entrepreneurs and management teams each year. From 2019 to 2020, the team conducted over 10,000 phone calls and 1,500 meetings with prospective companies.



As an affiliate of our sponsor, Lead Edge will be providing us with access to its infrastructure and network to pursue our initial business combination. We believe the sophistication of the Lead Edge sourcing engine and breadth of the Lead Edge LP network will be meaningful differentiators.

We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities with a compelling industry backdrop and an opportunity for transformational growth. Our objectives are to generate attractive returns for our shareholders and enhance value by improving the operational performance of the acquired company.



With respect to the above, past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management team and their respective affiliates have been involved with a large number of public and private companies in addition to those identified above, not all of which have achieved similar performance levels. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors — Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.” No member of our management team has any experience in operating special purpose acquisition companies. For a complete list of our executive officers and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and the company, please refer to “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”

Our Forward Purchase Agreement and Committed Capital



We believe our ability to complete our initial business combination will be enhanced by the certainty associated with entering into a forward purchase agreement with LEC V. Under the agreement, LEC V has agreed to purchase up to $50,000,000 of units, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-fourth of one warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, for a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination.



The terms of the forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants, respectively, will generally be identical to the terms of the Class A ordinary shares and the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in the Initial Public Offering, except that the forward purchase securities will have certain registration rights, as described herein.



We believe our committed capital will make us more attractive to a potential business combination target.



Technology Companies and the Public Markets



The software, Internet and technology sectors are beneficiaries of secular tailwinds. We believe that these favorable tailwinds, combined with superior business attributes, will propel these sectors to outperform well into the future, generating strong returns for investors.



Organizations today operate in highly complex environments that are evolving at an increasing rate. Operational teams are being forced to do more with less and require tools to enable that. Software has become the solution to this problem and the backbone of every industry, transforming how organizations engage with customers and operate their businesses. Historical IT spend on software has increased substantially in recent years, growing 14.8% from 2018 to 2019. This is expected to continue, with a forecasted compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 8.5% from 2019 – 2024 according to Gartner. Additionally, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) (subscription, cloud-hosted software) is projected by Gartner to grow at a 12.9% CAGR from 2019 – 2024. We believe such strong underlying growth rates will translate to sustainable outperformance by software/SaaS businesses.

The growth of the Internet is something everyone has witnessed first-hand, and a growing part of each day is spent utilizing the world wide web. Although the Internet has been around since the 1960s, access and use have increased significantly in recent years, with user counts growing from 361 million in 2000 to over 4.8 billion in 2020, according to a Broadband Search market report. The Internet has redefined the daily lives of individuals, changing how goods, services and entertainment are distributed. Digital consumption has more than doubled since 2008 and has accelerated in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. As individuals spend more time online, new business opportunities have emerged and all industries are adapting.






Amidst these secular tailwinds, we recognize the transformation taking place in how private companies access the public markets. Recent volatility and uncertainty have added layers of friction to the traditional IPO process that already requires a meaningful commitment of resources and time. In conjunction, the number of high-quality companies that are ready for the public markets continues to grow through robust private investment and maintained innovation. This creates an environment where alternative options are being explored.



We believe the accelerating adoption of alternative routes to the public markets combined with the inherently high quality of software and Internet businesses places our sponsor at a unique point of inflection on which we are determined to capitalize.



Our Business Strategy and Investment Criteria



Our business strategy consists of identifying and completing a business combination that can create meaningful value for our shareholders over time. We believe this can be achieved through identifying a high-quality technology company that fulfills our investment criteria as outlined below and using our operational expertise to drive sustainable value creation over time.



We recognize that a balance of investing acumen, operating experience and networking capabilities are requirements to successfully execute a business combination. Considering the track record of Lead Edge, as well as the collective investment experience and operating experience of our management team and independent directors, we believe our team excels in each of these categories.

As we leverage our competitive advantages to source and evaluate opportunities, we will apply Lead Edge’s investment philosophy that compares a set of eight criteria, the “Lead Edge 8” — while a perfect eight criteria business is rare and trade-offs must be made, we will aim for our investments to fill five to seven of the Lead Edge 8:




● | Capital Efficiency. We will look for businesses that have burned, in aggregate historically, less than $1 for every $1 of revenue. We believe this is one of the best approximations for the physical fitness of a business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Meaningful Revenue Traction. Lead Edge calibrates its investments around businesses that have achieved certain milestones in revenue and are thus definitionally past the stage of product market fit. We will apply this rationale to our prospecting in the context of the potential scale of our initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Meaningful Annual Growth. An attractive investment opportunity has a few years of sustained historical growth — “one in a row” does not get us excited. We expect returns will be generated through growth as opposed to financial engineering and will place a premium on top-line performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High Gross Margins. Gross margins are an indicator of the value a company is supplying to its customers. Ultimately, these high gross margins have a stronger likelihood of scalability and potential for future net profits.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recurring Revenue. Good businesses have contractually or transactionally recurring revenue streams, which give predictability into future forecasting.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High Retention. Retention measures the strength of a business’s recurring revenue streams. A business with over 90% annual gross retention is best in class.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversified Customer Base. We generally avoid businesses where more than 15% of revenue comes from one customer as this presents a risk that the business could be materially impaired by the loss of a single customer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profitable/Breakeven. This goes hand-in-hand with capital efficiency and we understand there tends to be an inverse correlation between profitability and growth in the technology space. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prospecting and the Lead Edge Sourcing Engine



As we consider the universe of prospects for our initial business combination, we view three buckets as our main areas of focus: (a) high-growth venture-backed businesses, (b) private equity-owned/operated businesses and (c) bootstrapped or under-the-radar businesses. We think the tools and workflows Lead Edge has developed over the years will ensure our exposure to buckets (a) and (c) while the networks and relationships of our management team and Lead Edge more broadly will uniquely position us for deals in bucket (b), which we think represents an exciting and under-penetrated corner of the target universe.



Over the last decade, Lead Edge has built out a proprietary sourcing engine that includes a customized technology platform which aggregates data sources, formulaic workflows to drive throughput on top prospects and a database to track all ongoing and historical touch points. The Lead Edge sourcing engine represents a sophisticated competitive advantage to lead identification for our sponsor.



The Lead Edge LP Network



One of Lead Edge’s key differentiators is its investor network. Rather than raising capital solely from institutions, Lead Edge raises its capital primarily from individuals. The vast majority of Lead Edge’s LPs are experienced operating executives, entrepreneurs and industry personnel. Since inception, the Lead Edge LP base has grown from 80 individuals to over 500. Lead Edge has continued to expand this network with each subsequent fund, curating the quality of the pool while carefully considering three vectors of value:

— | Geography: Lead Edge has LPs from across the top 50 metro-areas in the US, Europe and Asia, allowing for strong coverage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | Functional Skillsets: Lead Edge possesses investors with varying operational backgrounds and expertise (e.g. CEO, CFO, CIO, CMO, sales and Board of Directors).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | Industry: Lead Edge has investors with operating backgrounds across many different industries. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lead Edge can facilitate a multitude of relevant introductions per year between companies and LPs to enable potential advisory engagements, recruiting assistance or business development. This resonates with entrepreneurs regardless of what sector in which they operate, and we view it as a meaningful competitive advantage for our sponsor.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.



Each of our directors and officers will, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Lead Edge and certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which Lead Edge or such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his, her or its fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. As a result, if Lead Edge or any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to Lead Edge’s or such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.



Initial Business Combination



So long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of the fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.





7







We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post- business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target business, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post- business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.



To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.





8







Other Considerations



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Lead Edge, our sponsor, or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with, Lead Edge, our sponsor, or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



We currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. Our officers and directors have neither individually selected nor considered a target business nor have they had any substantive discussions regarding possible target businesses among themselves or with our underwriters or other advisors. Our management team is regularly made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with our company. Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any substantive measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition candidate.



In addition, Lead Edge, and certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities. As a result, if Lead Edge or any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.



Lead Edge, our sponsor, and our officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to identify and pursue business combination opportunities or to complete our initial business combination. In addition, neither Lead Edge, our sponsor, or our officers or directors, are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.

As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
