Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 22, 2021 and formed for the purpose of purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
On January 26, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (the “founder shares”). The outstanding founder shares included an aggregate of up to 750,000 shares subject to forfeiture by our Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that our Sponsor would collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (assuming our Sponsor did not purchase any public shares in our initial public offering). On May 11, 2021, 750,000 founder shares were forfeited by the Sponsor. On March 22, 2021, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 500,000 founder shares to certain officers, directors and advisory board members of our company.
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on March 22, 2021. On March 25, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 20,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit (the “Units”), generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Each Unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“public warrant”). Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 6,000,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement (the “private placement warrants”) to our Sponsor, Magnum Opus Holdings LLC, generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in a trust account (the “trust account”). If we do not complete a business combination by the Extended Deadline (as defined below), the funds then on deposit in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law).
We had granted the underwriter in the initial public offering a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. In May 2021, the underwriter’s over-allotment option expired.
Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended by special resolution passed on March 17, 2023) (the “amended and restated memorandum and articles of association”), the Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities, are issued, or deemed issued, by the Company in excess of the amounts offered in the Company’s initial public offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, all Class B ordinary shares in issue shall automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the closing of the initial business combination at a ratio such that, unless the holders of a majority of the Class B ordinary shares in issue agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, on an as-converted basis, in the aggregate, 20% of the sum of the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of our initial public offering plus the total number of Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or be deemed issued in connection with the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities issued or to be issued to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of any working capital loans made to the Company, minus the number of public shares redeemed in connection with a business combination; provided that such conversion of Class A ordinary shares shall never be less than the rate of one-to-one. 
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the 

5



requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter or (2) our annual revenues are less than $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.

Proposed Business Combination with ASIG 
On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ASIG Business Combination Agreement”) with Asia Innovations Group Limited (“ASIG”), a Cayman Islands exempted company, and Connect Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub”), 

6



a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASIG, which provides that Connect Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASIG (the “Merger,” together with other transaction in connection therewith, the “ASIG Business Combination”). The Merger will become effective at the time when the plan of merger executed by the Company and Merger Sub is registered by the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands or such later time (but not later than the 90th day after such registration) as the Company and Merger Sub may agree and specify pursuant to the Cayman Companies Act (the “Effective Time”). The ASIG Business Combination Agreement and the ASIG Business Combination were unanimously approved by the board of directors of Magnum Opus. The time of consummation of the ASIG Business Combination is referred to hereafter as the “Closing” and the date on which the Closing occurs is referred to hereinafter as the “Closing Date.” 
Below is a summary of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement and its ancillary agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor Lock-Up and Support Agreement, the Company Shareholder Voting Agreement, Form of Registration Rights Agreement and Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement, filed as Exhibits 2.2, 10.15, 10.16, 10.17 and 10.18 hereto, respectively. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined have the same meaning when used in the ASIG Business Combination Agreement and its ancillary agreements. 
ASIG Business Combination Agreement 
The ASIG Business Combination and Consideration 
Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement, among other things, (i) on the Closing Date immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Amended 2020 Convertible Notes, Amended 2021 Convertible Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and 2022 Major Investor Convertible Notes (to the extent holders of such 2022 Major Investor Convertible Notes elect to so convert) that are outstanding shall be converted into Company Pre-Subdivision Ordinary Shares (par value $0.00001 per share) in accordance with the respective terms and conditions therein, (ii) each outstanding Company Pre-Subdivision Ordinary Share and Company Pre-Subdivision Preferred Share (other than such shares held by Key Executives) shall be subdivided into such number Company Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the Subdivision Factor and re-designated as Company Class A Ordinary Shares if applicable, (iii) each outstanding Company Pre-Subdivision Ordinary Share and Company Pre-Subdivision Preferred Share held by Key Executives shall be subdivided into such number of Company Class B Ordinary Shares equal to the Subdivision Factor and re-designated as Company Class B Ordinary Shares if applicable (the transactions contemplated by this clause (iii), the “Share Subdivision”), (iv) the CEHK Warrant shall be amended to provide that the amended CEHK Warrant is exercisable for a number of Company Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to the terms therein and (v) each Company Option, Key Executive Option, Company RSU and Key Executive RSU shall be converted pursuant to the terms of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement (items (i) through (v), the “Recapitalization”).
Pursuant to the ASIG Business Combination Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each SPAC Class B Share shall be automatically converted into one (1) SPAC Class A Share (par value $0.0001 per share). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the SPAC Class A Shares and the SPAC Public Warrants comprising each issued and outstanding unit of the SPAC (“SPAC Unit”), consisting of one (1) SPAC Class A Share and one-half (1/2) of one (1) SPAC Public Warrant, will be automatically separated (“Unit Separation”) and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one (1) SPAC Class A Share and one-half (1/2) of one (1) SPAC Public Warrant. No fractional SPAC Public Warrants will be issued in connection with the Unit Separation such that if a holder of such SPAC Units would be entitled to receive a fractional SPAC Public Warrant upon such separation, the number of SPAC Public Warrants to be issued to such holder upon such separation will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of SPAC Public Warrants and no cash will be paid in lieu of such fractional SPAC Public Warrants.
Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement, on the Closing Date and immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each issued and outstanding SPAC Class A Share shall be converted automatically into the right of the holder thereof to receive one Company Class A Ordinary Share after giving effect to the Recapitalization, and (ii) each issued and outstanding SPAC Warrant (including the SPAC Public Warrants held as a result of the Unit Separation) sold to the public and to the Sponsor in a private placement in connection with the SPAC’s initial public offering will be automatically converted into one (1) Company Warrant exercisable for Company Class A Ordinary shares in accordance with its terms. At the Closing, in accordance with the Companies Act (as revised) of the Cayman Islands, Merger Sub will merge with and into the SPAC, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the SPAC will be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASIG.
The “Subdivision Factor” is a number resulting from dividing (i) the result of (x) $2,500,000,000 minus (y) the Convertible Notes Adjustment Amount, divided by (z) $10.00, minus (y) the aggregate number of SPAC Class A Shares entitled to receive Merger 

7



Consideration pursuant to the ASIG Business Combination Agreement at Closing (assuming for these purposes that the SPAC Class B Conversion, as may be modified by the Sponsor Support Agreement, has already occurred), by (ii) the Aggregate Fully Diluted Company Shares, and (y) $10.00. The “Aggregate Fully Diluted Company Shares” means, without duplication as of immediately prior to the Share Subdivision, the sum of (a) the aggregate number of Pre-Subdivision Shares that are issued and outstanding, excluding (1) all Pre-Subdivision Shares held by the trust established for ASIG’s share incentive plan which have not been allocated to or otherwise do not correspond to any issued and outstanding restricted share unit of ASIG and (2) any Pre-Subdivision Shares or restricted share units of ASIG that may be issued in connection with investments and acquisitions that ASIG is permitted to make following the date of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement but before the Closing under the ASIG Business Combination Agreement, and (b) the aggregate number of Pre-Subdivision Shares that are issuable upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of all outstanding Company Convertible Securities or that are issuable in connection with any Transaction Financing. “Transaction Financing” means such equity financing transaction pursuant to which investors commit to acquiring equity or equity-linked securities of ASIG in an aggregate amount of $150,000,000.
Closing of the ASIG Business Combination 
Unless Magnum Opus and ASIG otherwise mutually agree or the ASIG Business Combination Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to its terms, the Closing will take place on the date that is two business days following the date on which all of the closing conditions set forth in the ASIG Business Combination Agreement have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing). 
If the ASIG Business Combination have not been consummated by 11:59 p.m., Hong Kong time, on September 30, 2023, the ASIG Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by either Magnum Opus or ASIG. However, a party may not terminate the ASIG Business Combination Agreement pursuant to the provision described in this paragraph if such party’s breach of the ASIG Business Combination Agreement has been a primary cause of or resulted in the failure of the ASIG Business Combination to be consummated on or before 11:59 p.m., Hong Kong time, on September 30, 2023.

Pursuant to the Company Shareholder Voting Agreement, among other things, ASIG shareholders also agreed not to Transfer any Major ASIG Shareholder Subject Shares from the date of the Company Shareholder Voting Agreement until the date of its termination, subject to customary exceptions. “Transfer” means (a) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer, dispose of or agree to transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, with respect to any ASIG Ordinary Share, (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Major ASIG Shareholder Subject Share, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (c) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a) or (b).
Registration Rights Agreement 
The ASIG Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, ASIG, the Sponsor and certain shareholders of ASIG and certain of their respective affiliates, as applicable, will enter into a registration rights agreement, to be effective as of the Closing. Pursuant to such registration rights agreement, ASIG agrees to file, within sixty days of the Closing Date, and use reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter, a registration statement covering the resale of all registrable securities on a delayed or continuous basis. ASIG has also agreed to provide customary “piggyback” registration rights with respect to such registrable securities and, subject to certain circumstances, to file a resale shelf registration statement to register the resale under the Securities Act of such registrable securities.
The registration rights agreement also provides that ASIG will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the securityholders against certain liabilities. The rights granted under the registration rights agreement supersede any prior registration, qualification or similar rights of the parties with respect to their ASIG securities or Magnum Opus securities granted under any other agreement, and any of such pre-existing registration, qualification or similar rights and such agreements will be terminated and of no further force and effect.
Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement
The ASIG Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, immediately prior to the Closing, ASIG, Magnum Opus and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company will enter into an assignment, assumption and amendment agreement. Pursuant to such assignment, assumption and amendment agreement, Magnum Opus will assign to ASIG all of its rights, interests, and obligations in and under the 

19



Warrant Agreement, and the terms and conditions of such Warrant Agreement shall be amended and restated to reflect the assumption of Magnum Opus Warrants by ASIG.
On September 29, 2022, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing the execution of ASIG Business Combination and other ancillary documents. The ASIG Business Combination is expected to close in the first half of 2023, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions and approvals.
Our publicly traded Class A ordinary shares, Units and public warrants are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “OPA,” “OPA.U” and “OPA WS,” respectively. 
Extension
On February 17, 2023, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (as supplemented by a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company with the SEC on March 14, 2023, the “Extension Proxy”) in relation to a proposed extraordinary general shareholder meeting (the “Extension Meeting”) of the Company’s shareholders to approve (1) the proposal to amend Articles 51.7 and 51.8 of the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date (the “Termination Date”) by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company with one or more businesses, which we refer to as a “business combination,” or (ii) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such business combination and redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company’s public shares included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that was consummated on March 25, 2021 (the “Extension”) from March 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023 (the “First Extended Date”); and if the Company does not consummate a business combination by the First Extended Date, the Termination Date may be extended, without the need for any further approval of the Company’s shareholders, by resolutions of the board of directors of the Company at least three days prior to First Extended Date, to May 25, 2023 (the “Second Extended Date”), which may be further extended, without the need for any further approval of the Company’s shareholders, by resolutions of our board of directors passed at least three days prior to the Second Extended Date, to June 25, 2023 (the “Third Extended Date”), and may be further extended, without the need for any further approval of the Company’s shareholders, by resolutions of the board of directors of the Company passed at least three days prior to the Third Extended Date, to July 25, 2023 (the “Fourth Extended Date”, and each of the First Extended Date, the Second Extended Date, the Third Extended Date and the Fourth Extended Date, an “Extended Date”), for three additional one-month periods, for an aggregate of three additional months (each, an “Additional Extension Period”) (such proposal, the “Extension Amendment Proposal”) and (2) an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated March 23, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to (i) reflect the Extension and (ii) allow the Company to maintain any remaining amount in its trust account in an interest bearing demand deposit account at a bank (the “Trust Amendment Proposal,” and together with the Extension Amendment Proposal, the “Extension Proposals” ). The record date of the Extension Meeting was February 21, 2023, and the date of the Extension Meeting was March 17, 2023.
On March 17, 2023, the Company held the Extension Meeting, at which the shareholders of the Company approved the Extension Proposals. In connection with the Extension Meeting, shareholders of the Company holding 13,404,883 Class A ordinary shares exercised their option to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account (the “Extension Redemption”). As a result, approximately $137,142,200.05 (approximately $10.23 per Class A ordinary share) was released from the trust account to pay such holders and approximately $67,473,088.35 remained in the trust account. Following the Extension Redemption, 6,595,117 Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding.
In connection with the Extension, the Company agreed to deposit into the trust account, (A) for the period from March 25, 2023 until the First Extended Date, $150,000 (the “First Contribution”), (B) if the Company does not consummate a business combination by the First Extended Date and the board of directors of the Company elects to extend the Termination Date from the First Extended Date to the Second Extended Date, for the period from the First Extended Date to the Second Extended Date, $150,000 (the “Second Contribution”), (C) if the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Second Extended Date and the board of directors of the Company elects to extend the Termination Date from the Second Extended Date to the Third Extended Date, for the period from the Second Extended Date to the Third Extended Date, $150,000 (the “Third Contribution”), and (D) if the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Third Extended Date and the board of directors of the Company elects to extend the Termination Date from the Third Extended Date to the Fourth Extended Date, for the period from the Third Extended Date to the Fourth Extended Date, $150,000 (the “Fourth Contribution,” and together with the First Contribution, the Second Contribution and the Third Contribution, the “Contributions,” each, a “Contribution”).

On March 29, 2023, the Company deposited into the trust account the First Contribution in the amount of $150,000.
Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to the initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either (i) at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds of our shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.
Our Initial Shareholders will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:

● | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the last applicable Extended Date or such later date by which we must consummate a business combination transaction approved by our shareholders in an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Extension Deadline”), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per- share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay distribution expenses), divided by the number of public shares then in issue, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims and other requirements of applicable law;

● | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with public shares on our business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or our officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such a business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Extended Deadline or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the approval or effectiveness of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our

taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations provided in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide we will not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets requirement.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
We currently utilize office space at Unit 1009, IBC Tower, Three Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have three officers: Jonathan Lin, our Chief Executive Officer, Frank Han, our President, and Kevin Lee, our Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been elected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and public warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding 

22



adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
