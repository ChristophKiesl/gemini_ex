References in this Annual Report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” or similar references, or “Mullen,” mean Mullen Automotive Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiary/ies Ottava Automotive, Inc., a California corporation, and Mullen Investment Properties LLC .
Background
The Company was originally formed on April 20, 2010 as a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company. On October 2, 2012, the Company completed a merger with Net Element, Inc. changing its jurisdiction of incorporation to Delaware. On November 5, 2021, we closed a merger (as described below) with Mullen Technologies, which was formed in 2018. We are a Southern California-based electric vehicle company that operates in various verticals of businesses focused within the automotive industry.
On November 5, 2021, we closed a merger pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 20, 2021, and as amended by a First Amendment dated August 18, 2021 (together, the “Merger Agreement”), with Mullen Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“Mullen Technologies”), Mullen Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Mullen Automotive, Inc., a California corporation (“Mullen Automotive-California”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mullen Technologies, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Mullen Automotive (the “Merger”), with Mullen Automotive-California, which changed its name to “Ottava Automotive Inc.”, surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company also changed its name from “Net Element, Inc.” to “Mullen Automotive Inc.” and The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (Nasdaq Capital Market) ticker symbol for the Company’s Common Stock changed from “NETE” to “MULN” at the opening of trading on November 5, 2021. The new CUSIP number of the Common Stock is 62526P 109.
Pursuant to the Merger, the Company issued, or reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding warrants, an aggregate of 43,971,895 shares, which represented 85% of the combined company. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger transaction, in which Mullen Automotive-California is treated as the acquirer for financial accounting purposes. For more information on the Merger, see “The Merger and Related Transactions” on page 15 of this Annual Report.
In connection with the Merger Agreement, and as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 12, 2021, our fiscal year end has changed from December 31 to September 30, effective for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. As a result, and unless otherwise indicated, references to our fiscal year 2021 and prior years mean the fiscal year ended on September 30 of such year.
The Company
Mullen Automotive Inc. operates a Southern California-based electric vehicle company that operates in various verticals of businesses focused within the automotive industry. The Company has two electric vehicles under development, one of which we expect to begin delivery of in the second quarter of 2024. Mullen has several divisions that operate synergistic businesses, being: CarHub, a digital platform that leverages artificial intelligence to offer an interactive solution for buying, selling and owning a car, and Mullen Energy, a division focused on advancing battery technology and emergency point-of-care solutions.
Company Overview
Our Strength and Strategy

● | Experienced and proven team in the Electric Vehicle (“EV”) space. Our executive team has extensive experience in the automotive original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") space. They have a detailed understanding of the product development cycle from blank sheet to post launch activities in both the high and low volume segments – knowing the different economies of scale which is vital to creating a high-quality
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

profitable product. The team brings expertise in studio design, engineering, manufacturing, energy storage systems, market analysis, corporate development, strategic planning and investment strategies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Design. Our platform architecture creates the opportunity for vehicles with unique aspect ratios - low roof line, wide track width, svelte body, and a long wheelbase. The vehicle will be a top safety plus pick and will have a five-star crash rating. To achieve this target, we will use next generation ultra-high strength steel alloys. The entire structure will use mixed materials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique plan. Our approach is speed-to-market with lower capital investment requirements compared to other startup EV companies. Our plan includes launch the Mullen FIVE Crossover in 36 months from program start (with start of production in Q4 of 2024), while keeping expenditures low by utilizing strategic partnerships in engineering and manufacturing, while implementing rigorous spending controls and traceability to mitigate extraneous spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For our initial launch we will use state-of-the-art Li-Ion technology, but we believe that our future battery technology will eventually allow us to deliver our high voltage batteries under $100 per kWh at over two times the energy density of current commercially available lithium batteries. We anticipate the batteries used in our cars will be able to withstand extreme abuse testing, which we believe should make them safer than other commercially available lithium batteries. We plan to utilize a more environmentally sustainable chemistry that does not have a high content of rare precious materials.
Our Market Opportunity
Sustainable vehicles are the future of transportation
In the last few years, we have observed a significant transformation in the motor vehicle landscape. Electric cars, which were once only a fringe element in a market dominated by major global automakers, are quickly becoming mainstream. Along with Tesla, which has been public since 2010, many major automakers are transitioning towards electric models. Joining them, our company and several other start-ups are developing EV offerings.
In our view, this trend is driven by several factors. A rising environmental consciousness is encouraging customers to weigh their emission footprint. As a zero-emission alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (“ICE”) options, an EV that can match or exceed an ICE in performance is a natural choice. Assisting with that choice, local and national governments are offering various forms of rebates and credits for the purchase of an EV and have otherwise begun to support the rise of e-mobility by accelerating the push for zero emission vehicles due to increased awareness of the impacts of global warming. As EV sales grow, parts volume is expected to grow in tandem, allowing automakers to purchase parts at a lower cost and further accelerating the switch to EVs. Lastly, the continuing improvement in battery technology,

continuing build-out of electric charging infrastructure, and the growing comfort with EV range capabilities could ease “range anxiety” and facilitate adoption.

The rise of the Sports Utility Vehicle
When designing our first EV offering, our team elected to develop a Sport Utility Vehicle (“SUV”) because of the recognized growth in SUV sales. According to market research, today’s customers increasingly prefer SUVs to traditional sedans or crossovers. According to JATO, an automotive market research firm, 2018 SUV sales globally, in the United States and the European Union were 29.8 million, 7.8 million and 5.4 million vehicles, respectively. According to Research Nester, a strategic market research and consulting firm, the global SUV market is forecasted to be 53.2 million SUVs in 2027.
Our Vehicles
Our initial entry into the EV and Crossover market will be designed, engineered, and manufactured in the United States. Our business model for entry into the EV market consists of core tenets that include speed-to-market (36 months), efficient use of funds and investments, experienced leadership and engineering, designed to US market needs, and complemented with a portfolio of competitively priced vehicles (multiple vehicles on one platforms) in the fast-growing ESUV segment.
We expect our products and services will include the following:

● | Mullen FIVE: The Mullen FIVE represents Mullen Automotive’s entry into the full-electric, mid-size luxury SUV market. The Mullen FIVE is competitively priced starting at $55,000 - for the United States market before federal and state incentives are applied. Offering at least two optional packages, with a price range from a base price of $55,000 to $75,000 (for additional features), will allow customers to purchase a vehicle with options that best fit their budgetary and performance needs. Product validation is expected to begin in the 4th quarter of 2023 with the first sellable vehicles available in the fourth quarter of 2024.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Mullen FIVE is expected to deliver an electric range up to 325 miles. We intend to focus more on efficiency rather than extreme performance. We expect to achieve this by optimizing battery capacity, vehicle aerodynamics, rolling inertia, and software controls.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
We intend to leverage the following growth strategies to drive stakeholder value:

● | Continue to develop the Mullen FIVE. We intend to continue to invest in research and development and work on establishing partnerships that would enable us to commence customer deliveries of the vehicle model named the Mullen FIVE as early as fourth quarter of 2024. As part of this plan, we expect to begin building prototype Mullen FIVEs in 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop additional high value, sustainable EV models. We believe the combination of our design expertise, along with the expected power and versatility of a new platform, will enable us to efficiently achieve our goal of providing a fleet of high value, sustainable EVs. We intend to utilize one or more platforms over time to develop additional vehicles to complement the Mullen FIVE.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Manufacturing Approach
We have recently purchased a 124,700 sq ft facility located in Tunica, Mississippi. This property will be the site for both advanced manufacturing engineering center and vehicle production. This location will allow the development team to prove out our flexible manufacturing technologies and product design capability (e.g., strategic use of off-the-shelf components combined with in house developed critical components and software), while affording us the opportunity to customize and innovate our manufacturing processes and optimize our product design with simultaneous engineering efforts, thereby serving as Mullen’s Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center (“AMEC”).

In support of the speed-to-market strategy, building a full-scale production facility is a significant milestone for our vehicle development and manufacturing teams. Building a production facility includes expansion of the existing 124,700 sq ft by an additional 1.2M sq ft; designing assembly lines (Body, Paint, General, and Offline); and preparing for the complexities of the manufacturing processes, while ensuring flexibility for critical changes. This plan includes utilizing existing assets that are currently in place for initial validation, and in parallel, begin efforts to design, develop, build, and equip the facility to support our planned production for Mullen FIVE and all other upcoming vehicles. We are currently in negotiations with several manufacturing integration companies that will assist in all aspects of design and development of the facility with completion by Q1 of 2024. The final constructed facility will be the location for testing functional vehicle prototypes as well a high-volume production assembly plant.

Marketing and Brand Awareness
We plan to hire several key agencies to draw, solidify and execute our marketing plan, coexisting and succeeding across different consumer verticals: Social, Influencer, Search, Online, Podcast, TV, Print and Radio.
We will also utilize strategic regional and national tradeshows, sporting and automotive events to showcase our vehicles in person and generate further interest, reservations and vehicle orders.
We also intend to increase our online focus in 2023 to include online vehicle ordering, allowing customers full online vehicle purchase, with trade-in quote, financing and insurance options. Customer delivery is planned to be scheduled for “Mullen At Home” delivery or delivered to closest Mullen Lounge Point location, as described below.
Extended Warranty and Insurance
We intend to use a combination of third-party extended warranty, insurance and self-warranty and self-insurance mechanisms, potentially including (if financially feasible and in compliance with regulatory requirements) a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary to provide for the insurance against certain risks, including auto liability and physical damage, general liability and products liability.
We are also planning to offer both financing and insurance of our vehicles. We believe we can reduce the total cost of ownership (“TCO”) for our customers and potentially generate additional sources of revenue by providing both financing and insurance for our vehicles.
We plan to keep introducing new customer programs and services to further define the Mullen customer experience. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we also plan to keep our lean sales, lease, and service model in order to be able to continue to offer great value to our customers regardless of the segment Mullen enters.
Direct Sales and Service
We are planning on launching with a direct sales model where we are the direct seller and servicer of our vehicles to consumers. This model is planned to be applied in states where direct sales models are legal and not challenged by typical franchise laws written for automotive franchise dealers.
Mullen Lounge Point
Lounge Point is expected to be the retail center experience for our retail sales network in North America and is planned to feature full vehicle sales interaction: including test drives, reservations, orders, trade-in, finance, insurance and delivery. 

10



Our approach is planned to be focused on superior consumer experience, in an easily accessible retail environment with a no pressure sales approach.

Our focus will be on delivering a premium vehicle experience while fitting nicely into everyday consumer life. Overall, the intention is to build vehicle sales opportunities upon awareness and involvement in customer communities.
It is expected that our initial set of retail Lounge Points will be established in high foot traffic centers where consumers visit daily and not off on a distance dealer row. This could be Main Street, outdoor based malls, entertainment complexes, commuter hubs and weekend leisure destinations.
Mullen Service Point and Mobile Service
It’s envisioned that Mullen Service Points will be established in close proximity to our planned retail sales Lounge Points, but not directly in the same location. Our sales and service locations are expected to serve different customer opportunities, and require drastically different layouts and square footage requirements. Establishing Service Points away from sales lowers our square footage cost and is expected to allow us to focus entirely on the customer in front of us.
It is expected that Mullen Service Points will be outfitted with the latest tools and repair service technology to efficiently service our vehicles. We also envisions offering vehicle collision repair and detailing services.
We also envision operating a mobile fleet of service vehicles that will be available on demand for offsite vehicle repair and service. It is expected that our mobile service technicians will be able to address and resolve most vehicle repairs while at the customer home or place of work.
It is expected that over-the-air (“OTA”) software updates and repairs will be made available to our vehicles via Wi-Fi or cellular connection. We believe we will be able to address specific vehicle alerts, allowing us to diagnosis and possibly fix the vehicle remotely, depending on the problem. It is also expected that general software updates will be conducted OTA as well. In general, OTA repairs and updates require less service visits for customers and better overall customer experience.
Research and Development
As an emerging automaker, we will rely heavily on research and development to establish and strengthen our market position. We will primarily conduct our research and development activities at our headquarters in Brea, California, and at our partners’ facilities with the majority of the activities focused on the research and development of our EVs and software technology platforms. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we incurred research and development 

11



expense of $3.0 million, which includes the development of 2 Mullen Five show cars that were debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2021. We will strive to undertake significant testing and validation of our products in order to ensure that we meet the demands of our customers.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees, and we seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners.
Trademarks
We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. We own 7 trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus 42 trademarks registered across the foreign jurisdictions of China, the EU, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, South Korea, and Singapore.
We plan to file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.
The following tables summarize information regarding our patents and patent applications. There are no assurances given that the pending applications will be granted or that they will, if granted, contain all of the claims currently included in the applications.
Patents.
We have 5 patents issued in the United States, and 7 patents pending. At foreign patent offices, we have 7 patents issued and 117 patents pending.
Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
We intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
Government Regulation and Credits
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, including standards adopted by regulatory agencies as well as the permits and licenses required by such agencies. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and we anticipate increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders 

12



to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.
Emissions
In the Unites States, Europe and China, there are vehicle emissions performance standards that may provide an opportunity for us to sell emissions credits.
United States
California has greenhouse gas emissions standards that closely follow the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"). The registration and sale of Zero Emission Vehicles (“ZEVs”) in California will earn us ZEV credits that we can sell to other OEMs. Other states within the United States have adopted similar standards including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. We intend to take advantage of these regimes by registering and selling ZEVs in these other states.
ZEV credits in California are calculated under the ZEV Regulation and are paid in relation to ZEVs sold and registered in California including Battery Electric Vehicles (“BEVs”) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (“FCEVs”).
The ZEV program assigns ZEV credits to each vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a set percentage of non-electric vehicles sold and registered in California.
Each vehicle sold and registered in California earns a number of credits based on the drivetrain type and the all-electric range (“AER”) of the vehicle under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule Test Cycle. Plug-in hybrid vehicles (“PHEVs”) receive between 0.4 and 1.3 credits per vehicle sold and registered in California. Battery electric and fuel cell vehicles receive between one and four credits per vehicle sold in California, based on range.
The credit requirement was 7% in 2019 which required about 3% of sales to be ZEVs. The credit requirement will rise to 22% in 2025, which will require about 8% of sales to be ZEVs.
If a vehicle manufacturer does not produce enough EVs to meet our quota, it can choose to buy credits from other manufacturers who do, or pay a $5,000 fine for each credit such manufacturer is short. This should provide an opportunity for us to sell credits to other manufacturers that may not have met their quota.
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity
The United States Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) concerning emissions for our vehicles. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. CARB sets the California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. There are currently four states which have adopted the California standard for heavy-duty vehicles.
The Greenhouse Gas Rule was incorporated into the Clean Air Act on August 9, 2011. Even though Mullen’s vehicles have zero-emissions, Mullen is still required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for the Greenhouse Gas Rule and a CARB Executive Order for the CARB Greenhouse Gas Rule.
Vehicle Safety and Testing
Our vehicles will be subject to, and will be required to comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). We intend that the Mullen FIVE will fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the 

13



need for any exemptions and expect our future vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and while we anticipate compliance, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted.
As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the U.S. Numerous FMVSSs will apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and EV requirements. We will also be required to comply with other federal laws administered by the NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE") standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements.
The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by the EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by the NHTSA if such tests are conducted.
Our vehicles that may be sold outside of the United States are subject to similar foreign safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. The European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that were scheduled to commence in 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe.
In addition to the various territorial legal requirements Mullen is obligated to meet, we plan to engineer the Mullen 5 to deliver 5-star performance in the two main voluntary vehicle safety performance assessment programs, United States New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”) and Euro NCAP. Five-star is the maximum attainable score. These independent organizations have introduced a number of additional safety related tests aimed at improving the safety of passenger vehicles, both for occupants and pedestrians involved in collisions with vehicles. Some of these tests are derived from the legal tests, such as side impact, but have higher performance requirements. Others are unique to the program. Areas covered by these tests in 2020 include:

● | Mobile Progressive Deformable Barrier
--+--------------------------------------


● | Full Width Rigid Barrier
--+-------------------------


● | Mobile Side Impact Barrier
--+---------------------------


● | Side Pole
--+----------


● | Far Side Impact
--+----------------


● | Whiplash
--+---------


● | Vulnerable Road Users (Pedestrians and Cyclists)
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Safety Assist
--+--------------


● | Rescue and Extrication
--+-----------------------

We intend that the Mullen FIVE will also be equipped with certain advanced driving assistance features which may allow us to garner further Euro NCAP awards for features which are not yet a formal part of the 5 Star rating. This will help promote the advanced societal benefits of the Mullen FIVE.
