ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are a premier provider of specialized and sustainable material solutions that transform customer challenges into opportunities, bringing new products to life for a better world. Our products include specialty engineered materials, advanced composites, color and additive systems and polymer distribution. We are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives, liquid colorants and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our," "Avient" and the “Company” mean Avient Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Avient was formed as PolyOne Corporation on August 31, 2000 from the consolidation of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). In 1948, B.F.Goodrich created a vinyl plastic division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating The Geon Company, a separate publicly-held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately-held company and became publicly-held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the equity interests in the global masterbatch business of Clariant AG, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Switzerland (Clariant), and the masterbatch assets in India of Clariant Chemicals (India) Limited, a public limited company incorporated in India and an indirect majority owned subsidiary of Clariant (Clariant India). The business and assets are collectively referred to as Clariant MB and the acquisitions are collectively referred to as the Clariant MB Acquisition. In connection with the completion of the Clariant MB Acquisition and effective as of June 30, 2020, the Company amended its existing Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Avient Corporation. In conjunction with its rebranding and new name, the Company also changed its ticker symbol from “POL” to “AVNT”, effective at the start of trading on July 13, 2020.
Avient Corporation is incorporated in Ohio and headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio. We currently have 103 manufacturing sites and eight distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. In 2020, we had sales of $3.2 billion ($3.8 billion on a pro forma basis to include Clariant MB), approximately 50% of which were to customers outside the United States.
Using our formulation expertise and operational capabilities, we create an essential link between large chemical producers (our raw material suppliers) and designers, assemblers and processors of plastics (our customers). We believe that our role in the value chain continues to become more vital as our customers increasingly need reliable suppliers with a global reach and increasingly effective material-based solutions to improve their products' sustainability appeal, performance, differentiation, profitability and competitive advantage. Our goal is to provide customers with specialized and sustainable materials and solutions through our global footprint, broad market knowledge, technical expertise, product breadth, manufacturing operations, a fully integrated information technology network and raw material procurement leverage. Our end markets include healthcare, transportation, packaging, consumer, building and construction, industrial, energy and telecommunications.
Polymer Industry Overview
Polymers are a class of organic materials that are generally produced by converting natural gas or crude oil derivatives into monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, and styrene. These monomers are then polymerized into chains called polymers, or plastic resin, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, in their most basic forms. Large petrochemical companies, including some in the petroleum industry, produce a majority of the monomers and base resins because they have direct access to the raw materials needed for production. Monomers make up the majority of the variable cost of manufacturing the base resin. As a result, the cost of a base resin tends to move in tandem with the industry market prices for monomers and the cost of raw materials and energy used during production. Resin selling prices can move in tandem with costs, but are largely driven by supply and demand.
Thermoplastic polymers make up a substantial majority of the resin market and are characterized by their ability to be reshaped repeatedly into new forms after heat and pressure are applied. Thermoplastics offer versatility and a wide range of applications. The major types of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyester and a range of specialized engineering resins. Each type of thermoplastic has unique qualities and characteristics that make it appropriate for use in a particular application. Thermoplastic composites include these base resins, but are combined with a structural filler such as glass, wood, carbon or polymer fibers to enhance strength, rigidity and structure. Further performance can be delivered through an engineered thermoplastic sheet or thick film, which may incorporate more than one resin formulation or composite in multiple layers to impart additional properties such as gas barrier, structural integrity and lightweighting.
Thermoplastics and polymer composites are found in a variety of end-use products and markets, including packaging, building and construction, wire and cable, transportation, medical, furniture and furnishings, durable 
 AVIENT CORPORATION


goods, outdoor high performance equipment, electrical and electronics, adhesives, inks and coatings and fiber. Each type of thermoplastic resin has unique characteristics (such as flexibility, strength or durability) suitable for use in a particular end-use application. The packaging industry requires plastics that help keep food fresh and free of contamination while providing a variety of options for product display, and offering advantages in terms of weight and user-friendliness. In the wire and cable industry, thermoplastics and composites serve to protect by providing electrical insulation, flame resistance, durability, water resistance, water swelling and color coding to engineered fibers, yarn products, wire coatings and connectors. In the transportation industry, plastic has proven to be durable, lightweight and corrosion resistant while offering fuel savings, design flexibility and high performance, often replacing traditional materials such as metal and glass. In the medical industry, plastics are used for a vast array of devices and equipment, including blood and intravenous bags, medical tubing, catheters, lead replacement for radiation shielding, clamps and connectors to bed frames, curtains and sheeting, electronic enclosures and equipment housings. In the outdoor high performance industry, plastic applications are used for components and colorants for all terrain vehicles and reinforced polymers are used for various outdoor equipment and gear. In the electronics industry, plastic enclosures and connectors not only enhance safety through electrical insulation, but thermally and electrically conductive plastics provide heat transferring, cooling, anti-static, electrostatic discharge, and electromagnetic shielding performance for critical applications including integrated circuit chip packaging.
Various additives can be formulated with a base resin and further engineered into a structure to provide them with greater versatility and performance. Polymer formulations and structures have advantages over metals, wood, rubber, glass and other traditional materials, which have resulted in the replacement of these materials across a wide spectrum of applications. These specialized polymers offer advantages compared to traditional materials that include design freedom, processability, weight reduction, chemical resistance, flame retardance and lower cost. Plastics are renowned for their durability, aesthetics, ease of handling and recyclability.
Avient Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: (1) Color, Additives and Inks; (2) Specialty Engineered Materials; and (3) Distribution. Previously, Avient had four reportable segments. However, as a result of the divestiture of the Performance Products and Solutions segment (PP&S) on October 25, 2019, we have removed PP&S as a separate operating segment and its results are presented as discontinued operations. Historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes. Please see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our segments are further detailed in Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Competition
The production of plastics and the manufacturing of custom and proprietary formulated color and additives systems for the plastics industry are highly competitive. Competition is based on service, performance, product innovation, product recognition, speed, delivery, quality and price. The relative importance of these factors varies among our products and services. We believe that we are the largest independent formulator of plastic materials and producer of custom and proprietary color and additive systems in the United States and Europe, with a growing presence in Asia, South America and Africa. Our competitors range from large international companies with broad product offerings to local independent custom producers whose focus is a specific market niche or product offering.
The distribution of polymer resin is also highly competitive. Speed, service, reputation, product line, brand recognition, delivery, quality and price are the principal factors affecting competition. We compete against other national independent resin distributors in North America, along with other regional distributors. Growth in the polymer distribution market is highly correlated with growth in the base polymer resins market. We believe that the strength of our company name and reputation, the broad range of product offerings from our suppliers and our speed and responsiveness, combined with the quality of products and agility of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively.
Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used by our manufacturing operations are polyolefin and other thermoplastic resins, TiO2, inorganic and organic pigments, all of which we believe are in adequate supply. See the discussion of risks associated with raw material supply and costs in Item 1A, “Risk Factors."
 AVIENT CORPORATION


Patents and Trademarks
We own and maintain a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other key countries that contribute to our competitiveness in the markets we serve because they protect our inventions and product names against infringement by others. Patents exist for 20 years from filing date, and trademarks have an indefinite life based upon continued use. While we view our patents and trademarks to be valuable because of the broad scope of our products and services and brand recognition we enjoy, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Nevertheless, we have management processes designed to rigorously protect our inventions and trademarks. 
Seasonality and Backlog
Sales of our products and services are typically seasonal, as demand has historically been slower in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to irregular quarterly demand patterns in 2020. Because of the nature of our business, we do not believe that our backlog is a meaningful indicator of the level of present or future business.
Working Capital Practices
Our products are generally manufactured with a short turnaround time, and the scheduling of manufacturing activities from customer orders generally includes enough lead time to assure delivery of an adequate supply of raw materials. We offer payment terms to our customers that are competitive. We generally allow our customers to return merchandise if pre-agreed quality standards or specifications are not met; however, we employ quality assurance practices that seek to minimize customer returns. Our customer returns are immaterial.
Significant Customers
No customer accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated revenues in 2020 and we do not believe we would suffer a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements if we were to lose any single customer. 
Research and Development
We have substantial technology and development capabilities. Our efforts are largely devoted to developing new product formulations to satisfy defined market needs by providing quality technical services to evaluate alternative raw materials, assuring the continued success of our products for customer applications, providing technology to improve our products, processes and applications and providing support to our manufacturing plants for cost reduction, productivity and quality improvement programs. We operate research and development centers that support our commercial development activities and manufacturing operations. These facilities are equipped with state-of-the-art analytical, synthesis, polymer characterization and testing equipment, along with pilot plants and polymer manufacturing operations that simulate specific production processes that allow us to rapidly translate new technologies into new products. Our investment in product research and development was $59.8 million in 2020, $50.6 million in 2019, and $49.6 million in 2018. 
Methods of Distribution
We sell products primarily through direct sales personnel, distributors, including our Distribution segment, and commissioned sales agents. We primarily use truck carriers to transport our products to customers, although some customers pick up product at our manufacturing facilities or warehouses. We also ship some of our manufactured products to customers by rail.
Human Capital Resources
“People” is the first of Avient’s four cornerstones of sustainability (People, Products, Planet and Performance), which, together with our core values and our four-pillar strategy, form the framework of our company culture. The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce as well as our executive officers and other key personnel. 
We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that guide our human capital management approach as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through a number of programs, policies and initiatives, as described below. From safety to training to community engagement, our people are at the forefront of everything that we do. We are dedicated to building a high-performing and inclusive culture and investing in our people so that our most valuable resource has the skills and confidence to lead Avient and deliver value for our customers and stakeholders.
 AVIENT CORPORATION


As of December 31, 2020, Avient employed approximately 8,400 people, 33% of which are located in the U.S. and Canada, 35% are located in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 25% are located in Asia, and 7% are located in Latin America. 
Safety and Health
The top priority at Avient is safety and our ultimate goal is to operate injury free. Progress toward this goal is measured at the business unit and regional levels, communicated globally, and linked to a number of recognition mechanisms. In 2020, we maintained world-class performance for our industry, with a recordable incident rate of 0.50 per 100 full-time workers per year as compared to industry average of 3.70 in 2019. We continue to set high standards for our operations as we strive to achieve our goal of zero recordable injuries. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly began implementing changes in our business designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, and to support appropriate physical distancing and other health and safety protocols. We implemented remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible, including split shifts at facilities and remote work options for non-essential on-site functions. We mobilized regional COVID task forces and collaboratively developed health and safety protocols, including enhanced cleaning and sanitary procedures, domestic and international travel restrictions, and return-to-work and visitor screening procedures. We also postponed or canceled hosting or attending large events. As the pandemic continues, we are consistently monitoring and adhering to local government requirements and conditions everywhere we operate. We are working vigilantly to prioritize the health and safety of our associates first, while still continuing to operate and serve the essential and emerging needs around the world through our products and services. 
Employee Recruitment
We actively recruit and seek the best and the brightest talent through numerous channels, including job fairs, online talent networks, industry associations, referrals and campus recruiting. We recruit at more than 25 leading universities around the world and hire approximately 140 new graduates each year as full-time, co-ops or interns. We have launched seven highly coveted rotational development roles—from marketing to operational excellence to finance to IT—where newly hired associates rotate through various departments and jobs for up to two years, contributing their skills while also building diverse, well-rounded knowledge of our Company and its many stakeholders. We leverage global processes and systems to create a positive candidate experience with opportunities for entry level and experienced hires.
Training and Development
Training and development of our workforce is crucial for Avient, as it influences our “great place to work” culture while enabling our teams to accomplish business goals. Training and development opportunities are provided to all full-time and part-time associates through global programs and technology, to ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for all associates. Examples of training and development opportunities available to our employees include: regular performance feedback, career development discussions with managers, training and professional development courses through Avient Academy, and access to the global eLearning platform, LinkedIn Learning. 
Avient also offers nomination-based leadership development programs, such as NextGen, PolyMasters, Lean Six Sigma Master Blackbelt, as well as Core Leadership, an open-enrollment program for leaders of people globally. In 2019, we sought to improve engagement and our culture of learning in our manufacturing locations. With the launch of our Engage program, we brought classroom experiences focused on our products and customers to our production associates. Some of the topics covered by our training programs include: leadership development, safety, Lean Six Sigma concepts, technical and operational skills, and ethics and compliance. Leaders at Avient play a key role in our approach to training and development. Executive leaders serve as facilitators in our leadership programs, and NextGen graduates lead the Engage training sessions. 
Diversity and Inclusion
At Avient, we recognize the immense benefits that a diverse team brings to our organization, including delivering better business outcomes. Our talented people leverage their diverse backgrounds and skills toward a common goal: meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same. This spirit of inclusive collaboration can be felt throughout our Company. It drives the innovation that earns us leadership positions in the markets we serve and underpins the high level of respect we show each other every day. 
Our commitment to diversity begins at the highest levels of our organization, as evidenced by our "Winning" distinction from the 2020 Women on Boards organization for having 30% female board members, exceeding that 
 AVIENT CORPORATION


organization's criteria of 20%. The board is currently exploring adding an additional board member who is from an underrepresented minority.
From a management perspective, 60% of our CEO's direct reports are female or minority which we believe sets the right tone and expectation for diversity and inclusion within the Company.
More broadly within the Company, our diversity and inclusion approach is fostered by multiple Employee Resource Groups that are driving improvements and opening opportunities throughout our organization. The vision that guides our collective efforts is consistent and unwavering: to be the company of choice for all. It is from this vision that our Employee Resource Groups were born and flourish today. Each group has its own mission and supporting activities, and their efforts coalesce to help educate and inspire our global workforce and fortify sustainable business practices. 
Our Employee Resource Groups include: PRIDE at Avient (which is working to create a safe and accepting environment that enables LGBTQ+ associates to perform to their fullest potential and contribute to the success of our company), HYPE (which stands for Harnessing Young Potential Energy and is building a collaborative network of Avient’s young professionals), and LEAD by Women (which promotes diversity and inclusion by increasing access to the tools and resources necessary to build leadership skills and accelerate careers).
The executive leadership team manages our diversity and inclusion program, which ensures that we have leadership accountability in advancing our diversity and inclusion strategy. In addition to bi-annual reviews with the leadership team, Avient has implemented recruiting guidelines to expand our diverse talent pipeline, with at least one-third of candidates being female or a U.S. minority. 
Additionally, PRIDE at Avient continues to lead best practices and meaningful programming to improve experiences of LGBTQ+ employees in our workplace. Their efforts were instrumental in our achievement of earning the distinction of a "Best Place to Work" on the Corporate Equality Index with a perfect score of 100% in 2020 and 2021. 
Other initiatives, including Mentoring at Avient and campus partnerships are vital for progress in our diversity and inclusion journey. We require equality of opportunity for all qualified individuals in accordance with applicable laws. Decisions on hiring, promotion, development, compensation or advancement are based solely on a person’s qualifications, abilities, experience and performance, except where local law requires us to take actions to increase employment opportunities for a specific group. The Avient Ethics Hotline serves as a mechanism for associates to anonymously report any perceived concerns regarding these topics.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
We strive to remain competitive in the global marketplace and provide foundational rewards to attract and retain top talent. In general, our overall philosophy on compensation encompasses the following principles:
•provide all levels of associates with a compensation package that aligns Avient’s and the associates’ interests through the use of base and annual incentive pay programs;
•maintain a competitive pay program that serves to attract, retain, motivate and reward associates, and;
•award individual pay commensurate with experience, level of responsibility, and marketability.
Associate Benefits: Awards and Recognition Programs
Our ongoing associate feedback is highly valued, discussed, and most importantly, acted upon to make improvements. This includes our culture and unique benefits we offer. In 2019, we offered Flex Fridays, an adapted schedule that allows associates to have up to six Fridays off work during the summer without using vacation time. Associates work with their supervisor to create a flexible schedule that will allow them to complete their work hours. In 2020, we embraced and directed other workplace flexibility and work from home arrangements to combat the spread of COVID-19 and protect our people.
In addition, we continue to offer our global benefit of community service hours, where each associate is provided 16 hours of paid time off each year to participate in activities to support and help create more sustainable communities. Activities can be done as a group of fellow Avient associates or individually. These hours are used during a normally scheduled work day. Since 2018, Avient associates have performed more than 10,000 hours of community service through this program.
We celebrate, reward and share our associates’ great work through our recognition programs, some of which are listed below and available globally:
 AVIENT CORPORATION

A Great Place to Work®
With all the time, effort and resources we invest to build our culture and support our associates, we have been honored to receive awards that showcase our company and people. Back in 2018, we were very proud to earn our first Great Place to Work® certification by the Great Place to Work Institute in the U.S. We conducted a pulse engagement survey in 2019. This shorter, more focused survey was intended to provide actionable insights to managers in key focus areas. We mapped these survey questions back to core areas of prior surveys, and achieved improvements in critical areas such as trusting in our managers and team collaboration. 
In 2020, for the first time, we included all associates from Clariant MB in our employee engagement survey. Associates in over 40 countries and nearly 170 locations participated, providing actionable feedback to support our employee engagement efforts. Our results showed exceptional feedback from our associates, and we were certified again as a Great Place to Work® in 2020. 
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that apply to the production, use and sale of chemicals, emissions into the air, discharges into waterways and other releases of materials into the environment, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste material. We endeavor to ensure the safe and lawful operation of our facilities in the manufacture and distribution of products, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
We maintain a disciplined environmental and occupational safety and health compliance program and conduct periodic internal and external regulatory audits at our facilities to identify and correct potential environmental exposures, including compliance matters and operational risk reduction opportunities. This effort can result in process or operational modifications, the installation of pollution control devices or cleaning up grounds or facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable requirements.
We are strongly committed to safety as evidenced by our record-low injury incidence rate of 0.50 per 100 full-time workers per year in 2020 and 0.56 in 2019. The 2019 average injury incidence rate for our NAICS Code (326 Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing) was 3.70. We hold the American Chemistry Council's certification as a Responsible Care Management System® (RCMS) company. Certification was granted based on Avient's conformance to the RCMS's comprehensive environmental health, safety and security requirements. The RCMS certification affirms the importance Avient places on having world-class environmental, health, safety and security performance.
In January 2019, Avient, along with 29 other member companies, joined together as founding members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). The AEPW has thus far committed over $1.5 billion to help end plastic waste in the environment through investment in infrastructure, innovation, education, and clean-up activities. The AEPW intends to enable and bring to scale solutions to minimize and manage plastic waste and promote solutions for used plastics that move towards a circular economy. Our commitment to AEPW confirms the importance we place on being a global leader in all aspects of how we define sustainability: People, Products, Planet and performance. We have invested and are making important contributions in each, which are discussed in depth in our Sustainability Report.
In our operations, we must comply with product-related governmental law and regulations affecting the plastics industry generally and also with content-specific law, regulations and non-governmental standards. We believe that compliance with current governmental laws and regulations and with non-governmental content-specific standards will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The risk of 
 AVIENT CORPORATION


additional costs and liabilities, however, is inherent in certain plant operations and certain products produced at these plants, as is the case with other companies in the plastics industry. Therefore, we may incur additional costs or liabilities in the future. Other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and related enforcement policies, including those under the European Union Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (covering Conflict Minerals), and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, the implementation of additional content-specific standards, discovery of unknown conditions, and claims for damages to property, persons or natural resources resulting from plant emissions or products, could also result in additional costs or liabilities.
We expect 2021 cash environmental expenditures to approximate $20 million. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of environmental investigation and remediation matters.
International Operations
Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including currency fluctuations and devaluations, exchange controls, currency restrictions and changes in local economic conditions. While the impact of these risks is difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our future operations. For more information about the noted risks, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors." For more information about our international operations, see Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
