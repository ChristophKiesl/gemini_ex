Overview 
We are a medical device company focused on the development of implantable devices used in the surgical treatment of the sacropelvic anatomy. We have pioneered a proprietary minimally invasive surgical implant system, which we call iFuse, to fuse the sacroiliac joint to treat sacroiliac joint dysfunction that often causes severe lower back pain. As of December 31, 2020, more than 53,000 procedures implanting iFuse have been performed by over 2,300 surgeons in the United States and more than 35 other countries since we introduced iFuse in 2009. 
The sacroiliac joint, which is the largest joint in the human body, can cause debilitating pain. Clinical studies have shown that 15% to 30% of all chronic lower back pain is associated with the sacroiliac joint. Studies have also shown that the disability that results from disease of the sacroiliac joint is comparable to the disability associated with a number of other serious orthopedic conditions, such as knee and hip arthritis and degenerative disc disease, each of which has surgical solutions in which an implant is used and a multi-billion dollar market exists. We believe iFuse is currently the market leading implantable device used in minimally invasive surgical fusions of the sacroiliac joint in the United States.
Our iFuse Implant System includes a series of patented triangular titanium implants and the instruments we have developed to enable surgeons to perform the procedure. Surgeons place our implants across the sacroiliac joint, either from a lateral approach through the iliac, or hip, bones into the sacrum, or from a posterior approach through the sacrum and into the iliac bones. Surgeons typically use three iFuse implants to fuse a sacroiliac joint in the lateral procedure, and one iFuse implant in each sacroiliac joint, typically alongside another device crossing the joint and joining to the spinal construct in the Bedrock technique.
Our iFuse implants have a triangular cross section that resists twisting or rotation of the implant within the bone within which it is implanted, regardless of the surgical approach and technique used to place the implants. The triangular shape of our implants helps stabilize the joint, and the implants’ porous surface facilitates biologic fixation of the bone onto the implant, or bony ongrowth and ingrowth, that results in fusion. We hold issued patents on implants with cross-sections of many non-round shapes, including the triangular shape of the iFuse implant. We also hold issued patents for the method of placing those implants across the sacroiliac joint, as well as other parts of the spine and pelvis. Each titanium iFuse implant has at least three times the strength of a typical eight-millimeter cannulated surgical screw, and the large porous surface area of our implants allows for bony ingrowth. 
We introduced iFuse-3D, our second-generation implant, in 2017. This patented titanium implant combines the triangular cross-section of the iFuse implant with the proprietary 3D-printed porous surface and a fenestrated design. This design also allows the surgeon to fill the implant with ground-up bone before implantation, which some surgeons believe accelerates bone through-growth and biological fixation. iFuse-3D implants have shown positive bony ingrowth, ongrowth and through-growth in cell culture and animal studies, whether or not ground-up bone is used. We hold issued patents on 3D-printed triangular implants with fenestrations, or holes, which allow bone to grow into and through the implants.
In April 2019, we received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to promote the use of our iFuse Implant System for fusion of the sacroiliac joint in conjunction with multi-level spinal fusion procedures to provide further stabilization and immobilization of the sacroiliac joint. For this indication, surgeons typically use the posterior approach, through the sacrum and into the iliac bones, which we call the Bedrock technique. We received CE marking and began marketing our iFuse Implant System for this indication and surgical technique in Europe in December 2019. In March 2020, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for an expanded indication for the iFuse Implant System to support our trauma program. In January 2021, we received CE marking for a similarly expanded indication for use to support our trauma program in Europe.
We market our products primarily with a direct sales force as well as a number of distributors in the United States, and with a combination of a direct sales force and distributors in other countries. We generate substantially all of our revenues from sales of the iFuse Implant system. 
In 2020 and 2019, we generated revenue of $73.4 million and $67.3 million, respectively, a growth rate of 9%, and incurred net losses of $43.7 million and $38.4 million, respectively. Our gross margins were 88% and 90% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
In October 2018, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) with net proceeds to us of $113.4 million. In January and February 2020, we received a total of $63.0 million of net proceeds from our first follow-on public offering of our common stock. In October 2020, we received a total of $71.6 million of net proceeds from our second follow-on offering of our common stock. 
Market Opportunity 
Over 30 million American adults are estimated to have chronic lower back pain. Our experience in both clinical trials and commercial settings indicates that at least 30% of patients whose chronic lower back pain stems from the sacroiliac joint may be candidates for surgery with iFuse. Based on our market experience and internal estimates, and the assumption that the average person suffering from sacroiliac joint dysfunction has been in pain for five years, we estimate that the potential market for iFuse in the United States could be 279,000 patients annually, for a potential annual market in the United States of approximately $2.5 billion. While we have made significant progress in penetrating this market, U.S. patients received approximately 7,500 and 6,400 iFuse procedures in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Globally, the number of iFuse procedures performed in 2020 and 2019 was approximately 8,900 and 8,000, respectively. 
We believe that Americans spend approximately $85.9 billion per year on spine problems and that approximately 65% of people who suffer from sacroiliac pain are women. Sacroiliac joint patients may have experienced one or more of the following events that have contributed to disruption and/or degeneration of the sacroiliac joint: pregnancy, falls, previous lumbar surgery, automobile accidents, and aging, which may cause degeneration of the cushioning in the joint much like other joints. In patients with traumatic injury to the sacroiliac joint, surgeons are increasingly using iFuse for treatment of the initial traumatic injury, rather than using it to treat chronic sacroiliac joint dysfunction and the pain that it causes as the disease and pain progresses. We recently received FDA clearance for expanded indications for the use of iFuse in the treatment of pelvic trauma, including for stabilization of the sacroiliac joint in conjunction with the treatment of fractures involving the sacroiliac joint. We continue to invest in the development of products and techniques to help surgeons improve the treatment of these patients, and anticipate continuing to build products and pursue indications that can be used to treat pelvic trauma patients.
Diagnosis 
It is often difficult to identify the source of lower back pain. As a result, some surgical procedures performed on the spine have a sub-optimal success rate. For example, published studies of lumbar fusion have shown success rates of only approximately 60%. Unsuccessful spine surgery may result in failed back surgery syndrome, which has been shown to result in high healthcare costs with poor overall relief of pain. Published studies have shown that the sacroiliac joint is a cause of the pain in 32% to 43% of patients who have previously had lumbar fusion surgery and are experiencing recurrent low back pain. We believe low success rates of lumbar fusion are likely related, in many cases, to failure to diagnose the sacroiliac joint as the correct cause of pain. 
Since we launched iFuse, we have made considerable investments in teaching healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose sacroiliac joint disorders. We provide instruction and training on how to perform the provocative maneuvers in a physician’s office that can help establish the sacroiliac joint as the source of pain. If provocative tests are positive, surgeons confirm the diagnosis by injecting a small amount of local anesthetic into the joint under fluoroscopic guidance. The sacroiliac joint is confirmed as a pain source if the local anesthetic produces immediate and significant pain reduction. In addition to the differentiated characteristics of our iFuse procedure and triangular iFuse implants, we believe that more accurate diagnosis is part of the reason for the high success and patient satisfaction rates of the iFuse procedure. 
Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disease 
Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction frequently experience significant pain simply from sitting, standing, or rolling over in bed. These activities result in small movements of the sacroiliac joints and pressure transferred across the joints. The pain can be exacerbated with activity - when a patient walks or runs, for example, the shock from each step is transmitted up the leg, through the iliac bones of the pelvis to the sacroiliac joint. The initial goal in fusion of the sacroiliac joint is to immediately stabilize the joint which rapidly reduces the pain. Following initial stabilization of the sacroiliac joint, the goal is to permanently fuse the joint. We believe our proprietary triangular implants stabilize the joint better and more quickly than competing technologies. 
Surgical fusion of the sacroiliac joint with an open surgical technique was first reported in 1908, with further reports in the 1920s. The open procedure uses plates and screws, requires a 6- to 12-inch incision and is extremely invasive. The iFuse procedure involves a 1- to 2-inch incision and is much less invasive. Due to its infrequent use and invasive nature, resulting in post-operative pain and lengthy recovery, the open sacroiliac joint fusion procedure was rarely taught in medical school or residency programs. Prior to our launch of iFuse, most spine surgeons were unfamiliar with the sacroiliac joint and had never performed a sacroiliac joint fusion. As a result, when patients presented with lower back pain, spine surgeons often did not include evaluation of the sacroiliac joint in their diagnostic work-up. Surgeons who did recognize the condition typically told their patients they had nothing to offer surgically. 
Non-Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disease 
Although a number of non-surgical treatments exist for sacroiliac joint pain, they did not provide the level of pain or disability relief seen with the iFuse procedure for the patients participating in our randomized controlled clinical trials. Non-surgical treatments include: 
•Medical therapy, including opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. 
•Physical therapy, which can involve exercises as well as massage. 
•Intra-articular injections of steroid medications, which are typically performed by physicians who specialize in pain treatment or anesthesia. 
•Radiofrequency ablation, or the cauterizing, of the lateral branches of the sacral nerve roots. 
Our Solution - The iFuse Implant System 
Our iFuse system, which includes our implants and instruments, is designed to address the shortcomings of alternative treatments, including open surgery, non-surgical management, and screw-based and other minimally invasive stabilization and fusion procedures. As shown in the graphic below, our iFuse implants are triangular, and three implants are typically used in each procedure. Our implants are made of titanium and have a porous surface. Each iFuse implant is at least three times the strength of a typical eight-millimeter surgical screw, and the large porous surface area allows adherence of the bone to the implants. We introduced the original iFuse implants in 2009, and our second-generation iFuse-3D implants in 2017. 
The iFuse procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon uses a custom instrument set we provide to prepare a triangular channel for each implant through the ilium, across the sacroiliac joint, and into the sacrum. An iFuse implant is then pressed into the triangular channel, which is slightly smaller than the implant, creating what is known as an interference fit. The triangular cross section of our iFuse implants, as shown below, prevents them from rotating. Our triangular iFuse implants cross the sacroiliac joint and provide immediate joint stability, which is why we believe pain diminishes soon after the iFuse procedure. Over time, bone grows onto, and in the case of iFuse-3D into, the implants and across the joint, permanently stabilizing or fusing the joint. 
By contrast, open and other techniques for sacroiliac joint fusion typically use screws, plates and/or bone graft for fixation. When placed across the sacroiliac joint, standard orthopedic screws, which lack features to encourage biologic fixation, tend to rotate and loosen over time. Because of the triangular shape, porous surface, strength, and other differentiating factors of our iFuse implants, we believe that our published clinical data do not apply to other minimally invasive solutions. Little published evidence of safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, or economic utility currently exists for sacroiliac fusion devices other than iFuse. We are unaware of any data to show that our competitors’ sacroiliac joint screws, with features allowing biologic fixation, have a lower rate of loosening than standard orthopedic screws. In addition, placement of plates for open fusion procedures typically requires larger incisions and more invasive dissection, which results in longer recovery times and increased morbidity. We believe that the differences between iFuse and other products, as well as the substantial published clinical evidence showing the safety and effectiveness of iFuse, are the reason why a growing number of payors have recommended that iFuse be reimbursed for sacroiliac surgery to the exclusion of other technologies that are designed for the procedure. 
Typically, surgeons recommend protected weight-bearing for three weeks. However, post-operative instructions are patient-specific and some patients are allowed to perform weight-bearing activities sooner. Follow-up studies have shown that bony bridging across the sacroiliac joint is present in the majority of cases five years after the iFuse procedure. 
Three implants are used in most lateral iFuse procedures. Each implant crosses the joint from the iliac bone into the sacrum. Placing each implant requires four basic steps: 
•Pin. The surgeon inserts a guide pin through the iliac bone, across the sacroiliac joint and into the sacrum. 
•Drill. Surgeons drill over the guide pin, through the iliac bone, across the sacroiliac joint and just into the sacrum. 
•Broach. The surgeon impacts a triangular broach over the pin which prepares a triangular channel that is slightly smaller than the iFuse implant. 
•Implant. The surgeon impacts the implant into the triangular channel thereby spanning the sacroiliac joint and docking the implant in the sacrum. The channel is slightly smaller than the implant, which produces an interference fit. 
iFuse is a cannulated system, which means that the drill, broach and implants have hollow channels which fit over the pin for guidance purposes. As is typical in many orthopedic procedures, a member of our team is normally present in the operating suite during surgery to provide technical assistance for the use of iFuse. 
We offer three custom instrument sets for surgical placement of iFuse implants in the body. The standard set comprises largely stainless steel materials; the XL (Extra Long) set is the same as the standard set but most instruments are elongated by three inches for treatment of larger patients; and the radiolucent set comprises instruments made with more radiolucent (transparent to X-rays) materials, such as PEEK and aluminum, to improve visualization under fluoroscopy during an iFuse procedure. 
In addition to our iFuse and iFuse-3D platform technologies, we also provide enabling technologies for our surgeons. We introduced an instrument set that is cleared for use with Medtronic’s surgical navigation system, allowing the surgeon to visualize the 3D positioning of certain instruments intra-operatively. In March 2018, we introduced surgical pins cleared for use with the Mazor surgical robot, allowing the surgeon to robotically place the guide pin according to a computer-generated surgical plan. In early 2019, we introduced our Decortication and Graft Delivery Systems that allow surgeons to remove intra-articular cartilage and deliver flowable bone graft materials. 
In April 2019, we received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to promote the use of our iFuse Implant System for fusion of the sacroiliac joint in conjunction with multi-level spinal fusion procedures to provide further stabilization and immobilization of the sacroiliac joint. For this indication, surgeons typically use the posterior approach, through the sacrum and into the iliac bones, which we call the Bedrock technique. We received CE marking and began marketing our iFuse Implant System for this indication and surgical technique in Europe in December 2019. In March 2020, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for an expanded indication for the iFuse Implant System to support our trauma program. The Bedrock technique utilizes our proprietary iFuse implants, with one implant placed across each sacroiliac joint (for a total of two implants per case) using a posterior approach, through the sacrum, across the sacroiliac joint, and into the ilium. The Bedrock technique differs from our traditional iFuse procedure, in which three iFuse implants are placed across one sacroiliac joint via a lateral transarticular approach through the ilium and into the sacrum. The Bedrock technique is performed to increase the overall strength and stability at the base of a long construct for multilevel spinal fusion. Biomechanical testing has shown that iFuse implants placed in this position reduce sacroiliac joint motion by approximately 30% in conjunction with a long construct.
In addition to our iFuse and iFuse-3D platform technologies, we also provide enabling technologies for our surgeons. We introduced an instrument set that is cleared for use with Medtronic’s surgical navigation system, allowing the surgeon to visualize the 3D positioning of certain instruments intra-operatively. In March 2018, we introduced surgical pins cleared for use with the Mazor surgical robot, allowing the surgeon to robotically place the guide pin according to a computer-generated surgical plan. In early 2019, we introduced our Decortication and Graft Delivery Systems that allow surgeons to remove intra-articular cartilage and deliver flowable bone graft materials. In mid-2019, we introduced the iFuse Bedrock technique that supplements pelvic fixation in deformity and degeneration cases and provides enhanced initial stabilization and long-term SI joint fusion. In late-2019, we introduced iFuse Bone, an implantable bone product manufactured from sterilized recovered cadaveric bone tissue, to meet the demand of some of our surgeon customers to use implantable bone products to support and augment the patient's own bone tissue in orthopedic procedures.
Our Published Studies 
iFuse is the only minimally invasive product for sacroiliac joint fusion commercially available in the United States that, to our knowledge, is supported by substantial high-quality published evidence of safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, and economic utility. Our implants have a triangular cross section, which resists rotation of the implant within the bone in which it is implanted, helping stabilize the joint even before fixation of the bone onto the implant, or bony ingrowth, which results in fusion. Products from our competitors use screws to treat the sacroiliac joint, which we believe do not resist rotation within the bone as effectively as our patented triangular implants. A study we performed showed that our iFuse implants have more than six times the rotation resistance of a screw designed for sacroiliac joint fusion. We hold issued patents on implants with cross-sections of many non-round shapes, including the triangular shape we use for iFuse. We also hold issued patents for the method of placing those implants across the sacroiliac joint, as well as other parts of the spine and pelvis. Each titanium iFuse implant is at least three times the strength of a typical eight-millimeter surgical screw and the larger porous surface area of our implants allows for bony ingrowth. Three of our implants are typically used in each procedure. 
The safety, durable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of iFuse are all supported by a large number of studies that have resulted in more than 90 published papers. Several of these papers publish results from five prospective multi-center studies (INSITE, iMIA, SIFI, LOIS and SALLY) that we sponsored, two of which were randomized controlled clinical trials. LOIS provided long-term (5-year) data to support sustained improvements in pain, disability and quality of life, as well as radiographic evidence of progressive fusion of the joint. Additionally, there have been several studies showing longer-term follow-up of up to six years. 
INSITE Clinical Trial
INSITE is a randomized controlled study conducted in the United States. Positive 24-month follow-up results were published in August 2016 in the International Journal of Spine Surgery showing statistically significant and clinically important reduction in pain and disability after sacroiliac joint fusion but very little response to maximal non-surgical treatment. 
The INSITE clinical trial included 148 subjects treated at 19 centers in the United States, with subjects randomized in a two-to-one ratio to either immediate sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse or non-surgical management. The study design allowed subjects in the non-surgical management group to cross over and have surgery after six months. By 24 months after the start of the clinical trial, 89% of the non-surgical management group subjects still participating in the trial had elected to cross over to have the iFuse procedure, primarily because they derived little clinical benefit from non-surgical treatments. The study’s results can be summarized as follows: 
•Reduction in Pain. There was statistically significant and clinically important pain reduction in subjects treated with iFuse as compared to very small responses in the same measures in those treated with non-surgical management. Subjects surgically treated with iFuse had mean 52- 54- and 55-point reductions in sacroiliac joint pain at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (“VAS”). By contrast, subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean 12-point reduction (p<0.0001) at six months. 12 points is below the commonly accepted 20-point threshold for clinically important improvement. In addition, the non-surgical management group subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had pain reduction similar to that seen in subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with a reduction in VAS sacroiliac joint pain of 20 or more points due to the assigned treatment only was 83% in the iFuse group and 10% in the non-surgical management group. 
•Reduction in Disability. There was a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in disability in subjects treated with iFuse as compared to very little response in those treated with non-surgical management. Subjects surgically treated with iFuse had a mean 27-point reduction in disability at six months, on the 0–100 Oswestry Disability Index (“ODI”), while subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean five-point reduction (p<0.0001). Five points is less than the commonly accepted 15-point threshold to denote a clinically important response. At 24 months, the iFuse group had a mean 28-point reduction in ODI. At six months, the proportion of subjects with ODI improvements of at least 15 points was 72.5% with iFuse treatment and only 13.0% in those undergoing non-surgical management (p<0.0001 for difference in response rate). In addition, the subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had similar reduction in disability as the subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with an ODI improvement of at least 15 points with the assigned treatment only was 68.2% and 7.5% in the iFuse and non-surgical management groups, respectively (p<0.0001 for difference in response rate).
iMIA European Clinical Trial
iFuse Implant System Minimally Invasive Arthrodesis ("iMIA") is a second prospective, randomized clinical trial of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse compared to non-surgical management with a design very similar to that of INSITE. iMIA is a randomized controlled study conducted in Europe. Positive 24-month results were published in March 2019 in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. Like INSITE, results from iMIA show statistically significant and clinically profound reduction in pain and disability after SI joint fusion but little improvement after non-surgical treatment. 
SIFI Clinical Trial
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System (“SIFI”), is a prospective, multicenter single-arm clinical trial. Eligibility criteria and endpoints were identical to INSITE. SIFI is a single-arm study conducted in the United States. Positive 24-month follow-up results were published in the International Journal of Spine Surgery in April 2016, showing substantial and sustained reduction in pain and disability.
LOIS Clinical Trial
Long-term follow-up in INSITE/SIFI ("LOIS") is a prospective follow-on study, enrolling subjects at a subset of INSITE and SIFI sites treated with iFuse. Study outcomes at four years were published in July 2018 in the medical journal Medical Devices: Evidence and Research. In September 2019, we announced the publication of the 5-year results, which showed excellent durability of clinical responses and positive radiographic outcomes for SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants. Among 103 enrolled subjects, mean sacroiliac joint pain scores decreased 54 points from baseline prior to surgery. Disability scores decreased 26 points and quality of life improved 0.29 points, all of which are statistically significant, clinically meaningful and consistent with previously published LOIS 4-year results. The 5-year results from LOIS demonstrated that improvements in pain, patient function and quality of life demonstrated at two years in INSITE and SIFI were durable and sustained at five years. Independent radiographic analysis of CT scans at five years showed a high rate of bony apposition to implants on both the sacral and iliac sides (98%) as well as a high rate of SI joint fusion (88% bridging bone). Patient satisfaction remained high for patients treated with the iFuse Implant. There were no reported adverse events related to the study device or procedure at five years.
SALLY Clinical Trial
Study of Bone Growth in the Sacroiliac Joint After Minimally Invasive Surgery with Titanium Implants ("SALLY") is a prospective single-arm multicenter trial of iFuse-3D for the treatment of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The enrolled patient population was very similar to that of INSITE, SIFI and iMIA. A one-year manuscript, published in early 2020, showed improvements in pain, disability and quality of life similar to prior studies as well as CT evidence of earlier fusion of the SI joint. The study also showed marked reduction in opioid use and improvement in objective functional tests. 
SILVIA Clinical Trial
We are currently enrolling subjects in SI Joint Stabilization in Long Fusion to the Pelvis: Randomized Controlled Trial ("SILVIA"), a prospective, single-blinded international multicenter randomized controlled trial of use of iFuse during multilevel spine fusions with fixation to the pelvis. This patient population is distinct from prior studies in the following ways: 1) the patients have degenerative scoliosis of the spine and are in need of complex spine surgery to correct spine malalignment, which is associated with substantial low back symptoms and disability; 2) all are undergoing pelvic fixation, meaning anchoring of the spine constructs into the pelvis; and 3) some, but not all, have diagnosed SI joint pain. The goal of this study is to show that placement of iFuse in the Bedrock configuration reduces the rate of postoperative SI joint pain and improves the longevity of pelvic fixation hardware, failures of which are fairly common. 
Other Published Clinical Studies
To date, several studies, some of which we did not sponsor, have been published on the safety and effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse. These are prospective or retrospective, single site or multi-site, and U.S. or Europe-based. These clinical studies demonstrate the iFuse procedure to be safe and effective. These studies demonstrate pain reduction and/or ODI improvement that is statistically significant and clinically important. These additional studies are consistent with the results of INSITE, iMIA, and SIFI, including the types and rates of adverse events observed.
A study in Neurosurgery published in April 2017 showed similar improvements in pain and disability in patients followed for up to six years. The study also showed a substantial reduction in the number of subjects using opioids in patients treated with iFuse at their last follow-up visit. At the last follow-up visit, 84% of patients who received non-surgical management were using opioids, while only 7% of patients treated with iFuse were using opioids. 
In addition to clinical evidence, a number of economic publications we financially supported, including those in ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research, demonstrate that the iFuse procedure provides a cost savings to the healthcare system when compared to non-surgical management over time. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Coverage and reimbursement for iFuse products and related procedures vary by setting of care, payor type and region. In the United States, healthcare providers that purchase iFuse products look to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, accountable care organizations, and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover and pay for all or part of the costs of these procedures. These providers bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. Sales volumes and prices of company products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors for both the surgeon's professional fee and the facility fee which covers, among other things, the cost of implants used in iFuse procedures. 
The Medicare program is commonly used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare items and services, including iFuse procedures. Unless a national coverage policy exists for a particular technology, each of the Medicare Administrative Contractors is permitted to make its own determination of whether that item or service is covered by Medicare. Medicare’s reimbursement rates for the iFuse procedure vary due to geographic location, the nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., hospital inpatient department, hospital outpatient department, or ambulatory surgical center) and other factors. Medicare reviews and updates its payment rates and methodologies for these settings of care annually, and rates can change from year to year. In addition, Congress can alter reimbursement rates at any time by mandating changes to Medicare’s payment methodologies. 
Similarly, private payor coverage policies and reimbursement rates tend to vary across payors and settings of care. Payors continually review the clinical evidence for new technologies and can change their coverage policies without notice or deny payment if the product was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Payors also review and challenge the prices charged for products and procedures. 
In the United States, the American Medical Association (“AMA”), generally creates specific billing codes for surgical procedures under a coding system known as Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”), which surgeons must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our iFuse procedure. Once a CPT code is established, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), typically establishes payment levels under Medicare while private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. 
Prior to our launch of iFuse, Medicare and most private insurance companies reimbursed surgeons for sacroiliac joint fusions using either an established Category I CPT code or an unlisted code. A Category I CPT code is typically assigned to procedures that are consistent with contemporary medical practice and are widely performed. Procedures with a longstanding Category I CPT code are usually reimbursed. However, effective July 1, 2013, the AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel created a new Category III CPT code for fusion of the sacroiliac joint using a minimally invasive or percutaneous approach. Category III CPT codes are used for new and emerging technologies and are reimbursed sporadically. This new code functionally redefined coding for sacroiliac joint fusions because it meant that minimally invasive or percutaneous fusion procedures should not be billed by the surgeon using the general Category I CPT code for sacroiliac fusion surgery. This coding change was accompanied by the establishment of a Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment rate for facilities to bill for procedures with the new code. Following the creation of the new Category III CPT code, a number of papers demonstrating the clinical success of the iFuse procedure were published. As a result of these studies, along with the support of several professional medical specialty societies and leading academic surgeons, the AMA CPT Editorial Panel established a new Category I CPT code specifically for sacroiliac joint fusion surgery using a minimally invasive or percutaneous approach. This new Category I CPT code became effective on January 1, 2015. However, the new code did not immediately lead to positive coverage decisions by payors. In many cases, the payors wanted additional published evidence before deciding to cover the procedure. As a result, positive reimbursement decisions covering the procedure have occurred over the last few years, and some payors are still in the process of making decisions based on the most recent evidence. 
In March 2015, six-month follow-up results from our INSITE randomized controlled clinical trial were published. In June 2015, the largest spine society in the world, the North American Spine Society (“NASS”), published a positive coverage recommendation, based on the clinical evidence, signaling to insurance companies and Medicare Administrative Contractors that sacroiliac joint fusion using a minimally invasive surgical approach should be routinely reimbursed. In March 2015, the International Society for Advancement of Spine Surgery (“ISASS”), also published a similar, updated positive coverage document signaling to insurance companies in the U.S. that evidence supports reimbursement for the procedure. 
Coverage decisions for this code are made independently by each private insurance company and each of the Medicare Administrative Contractors that help manage Medicare. Around the second quarter of 2016, because of the iFuse clinical evidence, all Medicare Administrative Contractors were covering the procedure. At the time, very few private payors were covering. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, U.S. payors covering 311.6 million and 282.7 million lives, respectively, regularly reimbursed for the iFuse procedures.
Third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-
party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or maintained if obtained. 
In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and sometimes revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals, and ambulatory surgical centers for procedures during which our products are used. For example, the Medicare program updates hospital and physician payments annually pursuant to applicable law and regulations. 
Specialty benefit managers and companies which perform healthcare technology assessments have significant influence on coverage decisions. In May 2016, the ECRI Institute Health Technology Assessment Information Service published a positive review of the iFuse Implant System, citing our clinical evidence. In January 2018, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, the licensor to all 36 Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers across the United States, wrote a favorable review of the clinical evidence conferring a positive coverage recommendation for minimally invasive sacroiliac fusion, but only when performed with iFuse. In February 2018, Milliman Care Guidelines, a Hearst Company publication, also recommended coverage and in May 2018, AIM Specialty Health, owned by Anthem, established coverage for only iFuse and none of our competitors. In October 2018, eviCore recommended our iFuse system exclusively for sacroiliac joint fusion or stabilization. In 2020, Magellan Healthcare issued surgery guidelines for percutaneous sacroiliac joint fusion, which requires case-by-case review of authorization requests and follows NASS guidelines.
Private Payors. Private payors decide whether to cover and how much to pay on an individual basis. We target and track 65 of the largest U.S. private payors. As of December 31, 2020, of the targeted and tracked U.S. private payors, 56 were covering regularly, or had announced coverage for, the iFuse procedure, while the remaining U.S. private payors were reevaluating their coverage policies. As of December 31, 2020, of the U.S. private payors covering regularly, 35 have issued positive coverage policies exclusive to iFuse for sacroiliac joint fusion and 21 U.S. private payors are covering iFuse and other sacroiliac joint fusion products.
The table below summarizes the total covered lives with access to minimally invasive SI joint fusion and those with coverage exclusive to iFuse as of December 31, 2020: 

Covered lives (in millions) | Total coverage | Exclusive iFuse coverage 
Commercial | 195.8 | 74.1 
Medicaid | 62.5 | — 
Medicare | 38.2 | — 
Military/Federal | 15.1 | 5.6 
 | 311.6 | 79.7 

Note that because many individuals are covered by more than one health insurance plan or may switch plans during the year, the total number of covered lives reported by the payors represented above may be larger than the number of individuals who have access to the iFuse procedure through their health insurance provider at any given time. 
In December 2019, CIGNA established a positive coverage policy for minimally invasive SI joint fusion using the iFuse Implant System. CIGNA is the fourth largest commercial health plan in the United States with approximately 14.6 million members. In May 2020, Aetna adopted a new coverage policy for minimally invasive arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint for sacroiliac joint syndrome and sacroiliac joint pain. Aetna is the third largest commercial health plan in the United States with over 22 million members. Currently, covered lives counts do not include Anthem, which covers minimally invasive sacroiliac fusion procedures in the event of pelvic girdle trauma only. On October 1, 2020, Anthem published an update to its sacroiliac joint fusion medical policy. This update retained policy language limiting indications for iFuse to cases involving a history of pelvic girdle trauma, similar to earlier versions of the policy, and did not reflect the feedback from specialists Anthem received in mid-2020, or other substantive updates to the evidence base. Anthem has communicated to us that this feedback and additional evidence may be taken into consideration in future policy updates in 2021. In December 2020, Humana adopted a new coverage policy for minimally invasive arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joint exclusively when using titanium triangular implants (e.g., iFuse). 
There are other large and small private payors that have not published positive coverage policies for the procedure. Some of these non-covering payors are reevaluating coverage given the latest data, but there can be no assurance they will reach positive coverage decisions. In most cases, the payors who are not covering are reevaluating coverage. Many payors will only review their coverage policies for a procedure on a scheduled basis, which can be every few months or as infrequently as once per year. 
Prior to payor coverage, surgeons have been reluctant to get trained on a procedure for which they could not reliably be reimbursed. While we believe the increased coverage described above will have a positive effect on the number of iFuse procedures and our associated revenue in the future, the effect likely will happen with a lag time because, after a positive coverage decision is made, a number of months may pass before it impacts the number of procedures and associated revenue, since the surgeons have to be made aware of the coverage decision, in some cases attend one of our training courses to learn the surgical technique, schedule re-examinations of patients who were candidates for surgery, and then schedule surgeries for the patients who are still candidates. 
We believe that it generally takes between six and 24 months for a surgeon to fully incorporate iFuse into his or her practice after payors initiate coverage and the surgeon is trained. Further, the administrative burden on surgical practices can be substantial for patients where reimbursement coverage is new, and some surgeons do not believe that the current average surgeon reimbursement is yet adequate to compensate them. However, as reimbursement coverage has improved, surgeon interest in learning to diagnose the sacroiliac joint and perform iFuse procedures has been increasing. 
Coverage Outside the United States 
Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing and granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. 
Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) of medical devices is, however, becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medical device in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, and cost‑effectiveness of individual products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medical devices are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medical devices will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medical device varies between EU Member States. In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross‑border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States.
As a further step in this direction, on January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to increase cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medical devices, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal would permit EU Member States to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
In April 2017, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”), published guidance on minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion, recommending that the procedure be available to properly diagnosed patients in the UK National Health System. NICE develops guidance and quality standards in health and social care and is a worldwide leader in technology evaluations. The recommendation states that the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery is adequate provided that standard arrangements are in place. Use with standard arrangements is the most positive recommendation that NICE can make for an interventional procedure such as minimally invasive SI joint fusion. In October 2018, NICE published medical technology guidance specific to the iFuse Implant System, recommending that it be used in the National Health System because of the evidence demonstrating that treatment with iFuse improves pain, quality of life, and disability in properly selected patients. The continued relevance of the NICE guidance following the departure of the UK from the EU on January 31, 2020 is yet to be determined. Additionally, in August 2018, the public hospital system in France announced it would initiate coverage for iFuse exclusively beginning September 6, 2018. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing and granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval beyond what we have today in countries where it makes economic sense to do so. 
Medical Affairs and Education 
Our medical affairs team provides high quality educational programs internally and externally. Internally, specialized medical knowledge, and practical experience with iFuse are used to help educate our sales, marketing, quality, reimbursement, clinical, regulatory, engineering, and product development teams. This same specialized medical knowledge and practical iFuse experience provides the foundation for a wide variety of educational programs provided to both surgeons who will perform the iFuse procedure and the broader medical community that see and treat these patients. The medical affairs team is led by a fellowship trained orthopedic spine surgeon. As of December 31, 2020, we contracted with over 300 healthcare practitioners in various medical specialties, such as surgeons, pain management physicians, nurse practitioners/physician’s assistants and physical therapists, to help educate healthcare professionals about the sacroiliac joint as a component of lower back pain, proper diagnosis of SI joint dysfunction, non-surgical treatment options and surgical treatment with iFuse.
Our surgeon training programs are for orthopedic spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, general orthopedic surgeons, and orthopedic trauma surgeons. Since we began training surgeons, over 2,300 surgeons have treated patients with iFuse. We grew our active surgeon base to 588 surgeons as of December 31, 2020, compared to 539 active surgeons as of December 31, 2019. We define an active surgeon to be a surgeon who has performed at least one iFuse case in the last three months. The increase in active surgeons is primarily due to training of additional surgeons throughout the year. We will continue to pursue the remainder of the approximately 7,500 target surgeons in the United States, as well as international surgeons for training in the future. The COVID-19 outbreak challenged our traditional method of hands-on cadaveric and dry-lab training. In early 2020, the medical affairs team implemented a virtual education series for surgeons and mid-level practitioners. In July 2020, we began using an innovative, fully portable surgeon training simulator. This training platform allows us to train surgeons without need for an operating room or a fluoroscope. The computer-based surgeon training simulator provides quality haptics, or the realistic feel during the surgeon’s use of the instruments, and the training is performed without any radiation. One key advantage of this surgeon training simulator is that the surgeon can now be trained locally in their office or a hospital conference room in 2 to 3 hours, and the surgeon does not need to travel to a cadaver lab, which sometimes requires being away from their practice for as much as a day and a half. The simulator uses the same instruments and implants as those that are used during surgery. The simulator is used to train surgeons to perform SI joint injections and iFuse sacroiliac joint fusions, as well as the iFuse Bedrock procedure. We plan to expand the use of simulators for training purposes both in the United States and internationally. We will utilize the simulators and our existing programs to train new surgeons, increase the knowledge and proficiency of existing iFuse surgeons, and re-engage inactive surgeons.
We conduct a large number of educational programs for the broader medical community including primary care physicians, pain management physicians and other healthcare practitioners that may manage a sacroiliac joint patient non-surgically, such as physical therapists and chiropractors. In addition to these general educational programs, we provide continuing education programs focused on SI joint diagnosis and treatment to physical therapists and case managers. We are able to provide these programs for both groups in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We have trained over 6,600 physical therapists through our continuing education program as of December 31, 2020. Case managers, who typically are nurses, work in facilities where the iFuse procedure is performed, such as hospitals, or for payors or health plans. Case managers help patients navigate the healthcare system so that they receive the most appropriate treatment. As of December 31, 2020, we have trained over 1,300 case managers in the United States through our continuing education program. Our medical affairs team works with leading spine surgeons to educate other orthopedic and neurosurgeons on the differential diagnosis of sacroiliac joint disorders and the use of iFuse. We also work closely with medical specialty societies to raise the awareness of and teach the appropriate diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction and the associated treatment options. 
Sales and Marketing 
We market and sell iFuse primarily through a direct sales force and a small number of third-party distributors. Our target customer base includes approximately 7,500 surgeons who perform spine and/or pelvic surgery, including orthopedic spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, general orthopedic surgeons, and orthopedic trauma surgeons. 
Our direct sales organization in the United States covered twelve sales regions as of December 31, 2020. In each region, a number of territory sales managers act as the primary customer contact. Our territory sales managers have extensive training and experience selling medical devices for spine problems and pain management, generally focusing on emerging technologies and markets. For large and/or high volume territories, we also employ territory associate representatives who cover cases. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. sales force consisted of 64 territory sales managers and 58 clinical specialists directly employed by us, and 41 third-party distributors. As of December 31, 2020, we had 39 employees working in our European operations, and have established operations in Italy (2010), Germany (2014), the United Kingdom (2015) and France (2019). As of December 31, 2020, our international sales force consisted of 20 sales representatives directly employed by us and 31 exclusive third-party distributors, which together had sales in 35 countries through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, beyond Europe and the U.S., surgeons had performed the first iFuse procedures in Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey. 
We have made significant investments in our sales force since our initial public offering in 2018. We have built a valuable sales team, and we believe they are the key to the recovery we expect following the pandemic. As such, we have made it a top priority to support and retain our sales force through this challenging period. We limited new sales force hiring in the second and third quarter of 2020 due to uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on sales force productivity during this period, but resumed hiring of salespeople in the fourth quarter of 2020 based upon our favorable financial position and opportunity for future revenue growth. Our sales and marketing spending reflected normal business activities into mid-March 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on protecting key investments in our field force while curtailing most other areas of sales and marketing spend during the second and third quarter of 2020. For example, we guaranteed certain levels of incentive compensation to members of our field sales organization in order to retain these employees and partially mitigate the impact of the pandemic to their compensation. In contrast, we reduced certain other spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and related expenses, regional surgeon training, trade shows, and discretionary marketing. As revenue growth returned to the levels that we were experiencing prior to the pandemic, we increased our sales and marketing expense accordingly in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. 
We intend to continue to grow our specialized sales force to foster relationships with surgeons and support revenue growth. Our territory sales managers are senior representatives who educate surgeons on the sacroiliac joint as a primary cause of lower back pain. The territory sales manager identifies new surgeons who are interested in learning more about the sacroiliac joint and the iFuse procedure and/or the Bedrock technique. The sales representative works closely with our medical affairs team to train surgeons on the anatomy, diagnosis, and surgical technique. Once trained, the sales representative works with the surgeon to incorporate into their practices the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and the iFuse procedure to treat patients suffering from sacroiliac joint pain. Our clinical support specialists assist the territory sales managers to identify surgeons interested in training. The clinical support specialists also regularly cover cases, bringing our implants and instrument trays into the operating room for use by surgeons.
Over 30 million American adults are estimated to have chronic lower back pain. It is often difficult to identify the source of the pain and traditional methods of spine surgery do not have high success rates. We believe it is essential to raise awareness among lower back pain sufferers that their symptoms may be the result of sacroiliac joint disorders and that minimally invasive surgical treatments are available. We have implemented targeted marketing, education and direct outreach programs. We continually update our social media initiatives and post content to educate and engage patients who may be candidates for the iFuse procedure. We plan to make additional investments to further increase patient awareness, primarily through digital and broadcast marketing, including TV and radio ads, paid search, display advertising, social media and public relations.
Our business is affected by seasonal variations. For instance, we have historically experienced lower sales in the summer months and higher sales in the last quarter of the fiscal year as patients have more time in the winter months to have the procedure completed or want to take advantage of their annual insurance coverage limits. However, taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our financial results.
Research and Development 
Since our initial launch of the iFuse Implant System, we have introduced a number of new product and procedure enhancements. An example is the iFuse-3D implant, which we developed over several years and launched in 2017. The most notable instrument enhancement was the release of the revamped instrument set that included a number of radiolucent instruments. 
In 2017, we also introduced an instrument set that is cleared for use with Medtronic’s surgical navigation system, allowing the surgeon to visualize the 3D positioning of certain instruments intra-operatively. In March 2018, we introduced surgical pins which may be used with the Mazor surgical robot, allowing the surgeon to robotically place the guide pin according to a computer-generated surgical plan. In early 2019, we introduced our Decortication and Graft Delivery Systems that allow surgeons to remove intra-articular cartilage and deliver flowable bone graft materials. In mid-2019, we introduced the iFuse Bedrock technique that supplements pelvic fixation in deformity and degeneration cases and provides enhanced initial stabilization and long-term SI joint fusion. 
We expect to continue developing enhancements to iFuse to meet our customers’ changing needs and improve the surgery’s effectiveness. For example, we know that some surgeons use iFuse to treat trauma patients post-stabilization. We are developing products and techniques to help surgeons improve the treatment of these patients. We may seek regulatory clearances for additional indications as required. 
We continued our research and development activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical study expenses declined during mid-March through April due to hospital postponement of trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most hospitals allowed the resumption of clinical trials starting in May 2020. As such, we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future. 
Competition 
We believe that we were the first company to develop, manufacture, and market a minimally invasive implant cleared by the FDA expressly for sacroiliac joint fusion other than a modified screw. Over the past several years, other companies have subsequently recognized the opportunity and have entered the minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion market. We expect more competitors to enter into the market and an increased number of new product introductions by existing competitors. Many of our competitors are large, publicly traded companies that can dedicate far greater resources to the minimally invasive sacroiliac joint market than we can. These companies often have wide product offerings for spine and orthopedic surgery, which allow them to bundle products in order to win large hospital group contracts and can create a barrier to entry for us. For example, some of our competitors offer sacroiliac joint fusion products which integrate with their surgical navigation and robotics platforms, enabling navigation of their procedures or performance of aspects of these procedures by surgical robots. Many of these companies also have much larger sales forces than ours, which allow them to reach more surgeons. We also expect there to be a continued push for non-surgical alternatives. 
In the United States, we believe that our primary competitors currently are Globus Medical, Inc. and Medtronic plc. Our primary competitors in Europe are Globus Medical and SIGNUS Medizintechnik GmbH. However, these competitors sell screw-based products, which we believe to be weaker and less able to resist rotation than our triangular iFuse implants. We also compete against non-hardware products, such as allograft bone implants. These allograft products comprise human cells or tissues and are generally regulated by the FDA differently from implantable medical devices made of metallic or other non-tissue based materials, unless these competitors' allograft products fail to meet the FDA's criteria for regulation as a human cell or tissue product. 
Based on our commercial experience and market research, we believe iFuse is currently used in the majority of minimally invasive surgical fusions of the sacroiliac joint in the United States. Our triangular titanium implant is differentiated from other screw-based technologies on the market. iFuse is the only minimally invasive product for sacroiliac joint fusion commercially available in the United States that, to our knowledge, is supported by published clinical evidence including randomized controlled studies that demonstrate the safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, and economic utility. These benefits are supported by more than 90 published papers. We have received exclusive reimbursement coverage in the United States by certain payors based upon our differentiated product and quality of our evidence. We believe these factors provide competitive advantages to us in the market. The following are the primary competitive factors on which companies compete in our industry: 
•product and clinical procedure effectiveness;
•ease of surgical technique and use of associated instruments;
•safety;
•published clinical outcomes and evidence;
•sales force knowledge;
•product support and service, and customer service;
•comprehensive training, including disease, anatomy, diagnosis and treatment;
•product innovation and the speed of innovation;
•intellectual property;
•accountability and responsiveness to customers’ demands; 
•pricing and reimbursement;
•scientific (biomechanics) data; and
•attracting and retaining key personnel.
Intellectual Property 
We protect our intellectual property through our pending patent applications and issued patents. As of December 31, 2020, we had been issued 40 patents in the United States, and 14 patents outside of the United States. Also, as of December 31, 2020, we have 29 pending patent applications in the United States and six pending patent applications outside of the United States. We have focused the majority of our foreign patent efforts in China, Europe, and Japan. Our current U.S. patents on iFuse, including the triangular shape, expire in November 2024. Competitors may market similar triangular shaped devices upon the expiration of the patents in late 2024. Our current U.S. patents on iFuse-3D, including the fenestrated design, expire in September 2035. Our foreign patents will expire between August 2025 and October 2031.
We have 13 registered trademarks in the United States and have filed for 16 more. In other countries, we have focused on registering three primary trademarks: “iFuse Implant System,” “SI-BONE,” and the SI-BONE logo. As of December 31, 2020, we have sought protection for at least two of these trademarks in 60 countries including the 27 European member countries of the Madrid Protocol. The trademarks registered in the EU are also now protected by “clone” registrations in the U.K. 
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We may seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their agreements. 
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents but that compete with our proprietary technology and products. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications currently unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged and/or found to infringe. 
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and brands, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could reduce the barriers to entry that we have established for iFuse, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using iFuse, any of which could severely harm our business. 
Regulation 
Domestic Regulation of Our Products and Business 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The FDA governs the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses: 
•product design, research, development, and manufacture;
•product safety, testing, labeling, and storage;
•record keeping procedures;
•product marketing, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, export, and import; and
•post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions, and repair or recall of products.
There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the clearance or approval and marketing of our products. These include: 
•product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
•investigational device exemptions to conduct premarket clinical trials, which include extensive monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;
•Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
•clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
•regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
•notices of corrections or removals.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either premarket notification, or 510(k), clearance or approval of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring a PMA. 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA may place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements.
Class III devices, consisting of devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials.
510(k) Clearance
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. 
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. By regulation, the FDA has 90 days from acceptance of the 510(k) submission for review to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, if the modification changes the classification of the product to Class III, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA 
guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
PMA Approval
A PMA must be submitted to the FDA for any device that is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although the FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, once the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will formally accept the application for review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review an “accepted” PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. 
In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In approving a PMA the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.
New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Manufacturers may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Regulation of Human Cell and Tissue Based Products
Our iFuse Bone products are derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products ("HCT/Ps"). HCT/Ps regulated by the FDA under the authority of section 361 of the Public Health service Act must be not more than minimally manipulated and be for homologous use. They are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping and adverse event reporting. Our bone tissue products are regulated as 361 HCT/Ps. 
The AATB has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Accreditation is voluntary, but compliance with these standards is a requirement to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and other states that require specific licensing or registration.
Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including bone tissue for valuable consideration, but permits reasonable payments associated with removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage.
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials for implanted devices such as iFuse generally require an investigational device exemption application (“IDE”), approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects and study sites, unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (“IRB”), and the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the subjects’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA, or the IRB, could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high- risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. 
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
•Product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
•QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indications;
•clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
•regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
•notices of corrections or removals.
We have registered our facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to: 
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
•unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
•customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
•recall, detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
•operating restrictions;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approval for our products; or
•criminal prosecution.
The FDA inspected our facilities again in December 2016. No findings were noted. 
Promotional Materials - “Off-Label” Promotion 
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, we could be subject to additional significant penalties, such as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired. 
In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors, and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 
International Regulation of Our Products
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in other countries. For example, in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) our devices are currently required to comply with the Essential Requirements concerning medical devices that are imposed by the Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) and the related national implementing legislation of individual EU member states as well as related guidance. Demonstration of compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA.
To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices, a conformity assessment procedure requires a Notified Body to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body typically audits and examines products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, clinical evaluation report, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate of Conformity, we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the EC Declaration of Conformity. We have successfully completed several Notified Body audits since our original certification in November 2010. Following these audits, our Notified Body issued International Standards Organization Certificates and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to certain of our devices.
After the product has been CE marked and placed on the market in the EEA, we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements relating to:
•registration of medical devices in individual EEA countries;
•pricing and reimbursement of medical devices;
•establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
•Field Safety Corrective Actions, including product recalls and withdrawals; and
•interactions with physicians.
Failure to comply with these requirements may result in enforcement measures being taken against us by the competent authorities of the EEA countries. These can include fines, administrative penalties, compulsory product withdraws, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. Such enforcement measures would have an adverse effect on our capacity to market our products in the EEA and, consequently, on our business and financial position.
From May 26, 2021, the Medical Device Regulation (Regulations 2017/745) will repeal and replace the Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive and will apply in the EU Member States, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The Medical Device Regulation is, among other things, intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Once applicable, the Medical Device Regulation will, among other things: 
•strengthen the rules on placing medical devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
•establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and 
•strengthen the rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. 
The Medical Device Regulation substantially augments those aspects of the Medical Device Directive governing clinical investigations of medical devices. In addition to detailed provisions concerning the authorization and conduct of clinical investigations, the Regulation imposes on non-EU sponsors a responsibility to appoint a legal representative established in the EU and an obligation on EU Member States to ensure that systems exist to compensate clinical investigation participants who are harmed in that jurisdiction due to their participation. 
Once applicable, the Medical Device Regulation will impose increased compliance obligations, which we must respect if we wish to continue to access the EU market. This includes the up-classification of some of our devices. Moreover, the scrutiny imposed by Notified Bodies for the technical documentation related these devices will increase considerably.
Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is currently subject to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, and from 26 May 2020, the Medical Device Regulation, as well as other national legislation in the EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Regulatory Status
In November 2008, we received 510(k) clearance to market our first generation iFuse implant from the FDA. Since 2008, we have received additional FDA 510(k) clearances for new instruments, additional implant sizes and labeling changes. In the United States, the iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for the following conditions: sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruptions and degenerative sacroiliitis, which includes conditions where symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than six months; to augment immobilization and stabilization of the sacroiliac joint in skeletally mature patients undergoing sacropelvic fixation as part of a lumbar or thoracolumbar fusion; and acute, non-acute, and non-traumatic fractures involving the sacroiliac joint. In the future, we plan to pursue additional 510(k) clearances for new products and changes to the current indication for iFuse.
In November 2010, we obtained a CE Certificate of Conformity and affixed a CE mark to our iFuse Implant System to allow commercialization of iFuse in the EEA. In the EEA and Switzerland, iFuse is intended for sacroiliac joint fusion, including use in high and low energy fractures of the pelvic ring. Since 2010, we have added additional instruments, implant sizes and labeling updates and iFuse-3D, our second generation iFuse implant, to our product offerings in Europe. We plan to continue to work with our Notified Body to incorporate new products and labeling updates in our Technical Files for CE marking in Europe. Current delays in the revisions to the current bilateral agreement between the EU and Switzerland necessary to ensure the ongoing supply of our CE marked medical devices in Switzerland following entry into application of the Medical Device Regulation may, however, affect this plan. 
Since July 2013, we have obtained approval for iFuse in regions beyond the United States and the EEA, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan. We are currently collecting information to determine our regulatory strategy in Japan.
Environmental Regulations
We outsource substantially all the manufacturing of our products, therefore we have not incurred significant expenses relating to our compliance with federal, state, or local environmental laws and do not expect to incur significant expenses in the foreseeable future. However, due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Federal and state governmental agencies and equivalent foreign authorities subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers and prescribers of our products. Federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of, or a specific intent to violate, the law;
•the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government and to share in 
any monetary recovery. There are also criminal penalties for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;
•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented by CMS as the Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments and other “transfers of value” made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided (beginning in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and
•analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and patients; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state beneficiary inducement laws, and state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If we or our employees are found to have violated any of the above laws we may be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, significant fines, monetary penalties and damages, the restructuring or curtailment of our operations, imposition of compliance obligations and monitoring, and damage to our reputation. For a more detailed description of the federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, see the risk factor “We and our sales representatives must comply with U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including those relating to healthcare provider kickbacks and false claims for reimbursement, and other applicable federal and state healthcare laws, as well as equivalent foreign laws, and failure to comply could negatively affect our business” in the Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment section of Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act (“UKBA”), generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and/or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and its implementing regulations, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act enacted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009 (“ARRA”) (collectively, “HIPAA”), in the United States.
HIPAA imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also requires the notification of patients, reporting to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured Protected Health Information (“PHI”). Required notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach, under HIPAA. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, HHS would post the notification on its website, and we may be required to notify the media. Failure to comply with the 
HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in significant civil monetary penalties, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, including imprisonment.
In addition, even when HIPAA does not apply other federal and state laws impose security obligations. For example, according to the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
In the European Union (“EU”), we are subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of our employees, consultants, certain individuals who may be affiliated with our customers, including physician users of our products and, in the context of clinical investigations, patients. The personal data may include sensitive personal data including health information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, effective on May 25, 2018 and the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and the national laws implementing it. Each EU Member State may adopt additional legislation implementing these regulations into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU Member State. This should, in principle, result in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to be transparent and to disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR will be significant-the greater of € 20 million or 4% of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. Each EU Member State may also adopt additional related legislation and guidance in its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws.
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions and applicable laws, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place to fulfil their related obligations. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
We use third-party manufacturers to produce our implants and instruments. Our primary supplier for implants is rms Company (“RMS”) for iFuse-3D. To mitigate supply risk, we use a rolling twelve month forecast and take into consideration production lead times to maintain adequate levels of inventory for both our iFuse-3D and iFuse. Most of our instruments have secondary manufacturing suppliers and we continually work with additional manufacturers as our secondary suppliers. Substantially all of our products, including all of our implants, are manufactured in the United States.
We entered into a non-exclusive Manufacturing, Quality and Supply Agreement with RMS in January 2017, which was amended in July 2020. Pursuant to such agreement, RMS manufactures certain of our implants in accordance with our specifications, including both purchased and sterilized iFuse-3D implants, as well as uncoated machined implants which are subsequently coated to become our finished first generation iFuse implants. While the agreement provides that we are required to purchase the amounts forecasted in a blanket purchase order, we are not required to purchase product in excess of such forecasted amounts. The prices we pay for products are fixed under the agreement provided that if order volumes deviate from forecasted amounts beyond certain thresholds, we or RMS may request to negotiate further price changes. The agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods; provided, however, the agreement may be terminated early by either party, as specified in the agreement. RMS is currently our only supplier of iFuse-3D implants. 
We believe that our manufacturing operations, and those of our suppliers, comply with regulations mandated by the FDA, as well as Medical Devices Directive regulations in the EEA. Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic planned and unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. 
In the United States, products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, codified at 21 CFR Part 820, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications, including those issued by DEKRA Certification, B.V., our notified body. DEKRA has issued the following international certifications: Quality Management System ISO13485:2016 for our locations in Santa Clara, California, and Gallarate Italy; Full Quality Assurance Certification for the design and manufacture of iFuse; and a Design Examination certificate for iFuse. 
We are required to demonstrate continuing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain these certifications and will continue to be periodically inspected by international regulatory authorities for certification purposes. Further, we and certain of our suppliers are required to comply with all applicable regulations and current good manufacturing practices. As set forth above, these FDA and international regulations cover, among other things, the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections. If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to current good manufacturing practice requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Our operations ran at suboptimal capacity as a result of decreased iFuse demand from worldwide restrictions on elective procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2020, we expensed certain labor and overhead costs as incurred which impacted our gross profit and gross margin. We saw a more normalized operations capacity during the second half of 2020 as case volumes began to recover. We may experience similar issues in future quarters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Product Liability and Insurance 
The manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a risk of serious injury or death. We carry insurance policies which we believe to be customary for similar companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to cover all or substantially all losses that we experience. 
We endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes, but our coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances. 
Human Capital Resources 
Maintaining a sufficient number of skilled employees in each respective department is a key focus of our human capital efforts. Our ability to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled talent is a significant determinant of our success. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, and development, we strive to make SI-BONE an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs, as well as by programs that build connections between our employees and the communities in which they live and work.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 295 employees, including sales and marketing, product development, general administrative and accounting, both domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2020, we had a direct field sales organization of 122 in the United States and 20 in Europe. During 2020, our turnover rate was less than 10%.
Diversity and Inclusion
In order to realize our mission and vision, we are committed to actively fostering workforce diversity and an environment of cultural inclusion throughout the company. In 2020, we adopted a Diversity and Inclusion Plan, overseen by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our program goal is to increase gender and ethnic diversity in our workforce and leadership over three years, while continuing to provide equal employment opportunities to all candidates and employees without regard to any protected status. Accordingly, we track gender diversity among our global and U.S. workforce, the percentage of employees above director level who are female, the representation of women and underrepresented communities on our Board of Directors and the diversity of our U.S. workforce.
We aim to maintain a mix of backgrounds, skills and experiences in our board composition to understand and reflect the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, three of our nine board members are women and one of our board members self-identifies as Asian American.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and intend to continue to do. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. These benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. Additionally, we offer programs to help support employee physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs and the needs of their families.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020. We implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. This includes having the majority of our office-based employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work or work at customer facilities. A number of employees critical to maintaining our essential operating functions have continued to work from our office in Santa Clara, California. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that include maximizing personal workspaces, adopting shift-based schedules to mitigate contagion risk, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and instituting mandatory screening before accessing our offices. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country, include annual bonuses, restricted stock unit awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k), healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among many others. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we supported employees with standard merit increases, paid full-time wages to hourly employees when they were not able to access our facilities, and guaranteed certain commissions to our salespeople. We did not furlough or terminate any of our employees due to economic concerns arising from COVID-19 in 2020.
Ensuring fair and equitable pay is integral to our commitment to our employees. Our executive team and Board of Directors strongly support this commitment. In 2020, we conducted our first pay equity review with the assistance of an independent consulting firm. The consultant reviewed our employee compensation to determine whether any statistically significant pay differences existed between women and men and between minorities and non-minorities performing similar job functions. The review provided 
information to help us understand whether our compensation structure was appropriate and to identify what improvements can be made. In areas where pay disparities were identified, we conducted further evaluation to determine where adjustments were appropriate.
As part of our Diversity and Inclusion Program, we implemented an applicant tracking system in 2020. In addition to automating our recruiting and onboarding processes, the applicant tracking system also helps us determine whether there is a mix of new hire candidates in the system from different genders and ethnicities for open positions.
Talent Development
We value our employees and the passion, commitment, and professional depth they provide. To enhance employee retention and job satisfaction, we offer ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities that support growth.
Our human resources and sales enablement teams transitioned much of our leadership training from in-person sessions to remote learning with the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020. Our scaled learning platforms of on-demand and virtual classroom learning eliminates travel and allows employees to access development at their convenience.
We have robust annual performance review processes for reviewing employees’ performance and pay. To support our managers, we train them on conducting effective performance reviews and making compensation recommendations, which take into consideration market pay data and performance, as well as experience in an employee’s respective role.
Community Programs
We believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities, and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.
Our employees engage in a variety of activities to support their local communities. We acknowledge that community involvement is important to our employees and we support their interests in the communities in which they live. Prior to COVID-19, we hosted events at our corporate campus, including food, clothing, and toy drives. During 2020, we organized employee cash donations to food banks to support the neediest individuals in San Francisco Bay Area communities.

Emerging Growth Company Status 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). We will continue to be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023, unless one of the following occurs: (i) if our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more; or (ii) if we issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in the past three years; or (iii) if we become a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 
 As an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls. Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act.
Smaller Reporting Company Status 
We qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined under Rule 12b‑2 of the Exchange Act. We will continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company if: (i) our public float is less than $250.0 million; or (ii) our annual revenues is less than $100.0 million and our public float is less than $700.0 million. As per guidance, we determine whether we qualify as a smaller reporting company annually as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we may use the smaller reporting company scaled disclosure accommodations of Regulation S-K and S-X in our filings, including among others:
•two years of income statements rather than three years as required by Rule 8-02 of Regulation S-X;
•two-year management discussions and analysis comparison rather than three-year comparison as required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K;
•no requirement to provide selected financial data table required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K;
•no requirement to provide market risk disclosures required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K; 
•no requirement to provide supplemental financial information required by Item 302 of Regulation S-K; and
•less extensive narrative disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation as required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K.
