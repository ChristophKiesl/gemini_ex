 ITEM 1.            BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are the global leader in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of performance‑driven golf products, which are widely recognized for their quality excellence. Driven by our focus on dedicated and discerning golfers and the golf shops that serve them, we believe we are the most authentic and enduring company in the golf industry. Our mission—to be the performance and quality leader in every golf product category in which we compete—has remained consistent since we entered the golf ball business in 1932. Today, we are the steward of two of the most revered brands in golf—Titleist, one of golf’s leading performance equipment brands, and FootJoy, one of golf’s leading performance wear brands. Titleist has been the #1 ball in professional golf for 68 years and FootJoy has been the #1 shoe on the PGA Tour for over six decades. 
  Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are the cornerstone of the worldwide golf industry. These dedicated golfers are avid and skill‑biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe our focus on innovation and process excellence yields golf products that represent superior performance and consistent product quality, which are the key attributes sought after by dedicated golfers. Many of the game’s professional players, who represent the most dedicated golfers, prefer our products thereby validating our performance and quality promise, while driving brand awareness. We leverage a pyramid of influence product and promotion strategy, whereby our products are the most played by the best players, creating aspirational appeal for a broad range of golfers who want to emulate the performance of the game’s best players.
 Dedicated golfers view premium golf shops, such as on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers, as preferred retail channels for golf products of superior performance and product quality. As a result, we have committed to being one of the preferred and trusted partners to premium golf shops worldwide. This commitment provides us a retail environment where our product performance and quality advantage can most effectively be communicated to dedicated golfers. In addition, we also service other qualified retailers that sell golf products to consumers worldwide.
 Our vision is to consistently be regarded by industry participants, from dedicated golfers to the golf shops that serve them, as the best golf company in the world. We have established leadership positions across all major golf equipment and golf wear categories under our globally recognized brands.

 Our History and Evolution
 Founded in Acushnet, Massachusetts by Phil “Skipper” Young in 1910 and incorporated as the Acushnet Process Company, we manufactured rubber‑based products including water bottles, gas masks and bathing caps. Our golf business was established in 1932 when Young, a dedicated golfer himself, missed a critical putt in a golf match. Believing the putt to be well struck, Young took the ball to be x‑rayed, where it was discovered that the ball’s core was off‑center. Following this seminal discovery that many commercially available golf balls frequently had manufacturing inconsistencies, Young set out with Massachusetts Institute of Technology classmate Fred Bommer to develop a superior golf ball. After three years of development, the Titleist golf ball was introduced.
 The objective from the very beginning was to produce a golf ball that would set the standard in performance, quality and consistency, and become the preferred choice of dedicated golfers and the preferred trade partners who would serve them. In the early years, many of these preferred trade partners were also some of the first touring golf professionals. Soon the Titleist golf ball was the golf ball of choice wherever competitive golf was played. The core values of serving the game’s dedicated golfer with a superior product, in terms of both performance and quality, and having that superior product validated by the game’s most dedicated golfers and premium golf retailers, have endured for the past eight decades.
 In 1976, Acushnet Company was acquired by American Brands, Inc. (the predecessor company of Beam Suntory, Inc. (“Beam”)). We acquired FootJoy in 1985. On July 29, 2011, Acushnet Holdings Corp. (at the time known as Alexandria Holdings Corp.), an entity owned by Fila Korea and certain financial investors, acquired Acushnet Company from Beam. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in November 2016. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements– Note 2– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for disclosures related to our initial public offering and other related transactions.
 Our Core Focus
 Dedicated Golfers
 Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are avid and skill‑biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe that dedicated golfers are the most consistent purchasers of golf products and estimate that while they represented only approximately 15% of all United States golfers, they accounted for more than 40% of total rounds played and approximately 70% of all golf equipment and gear spending in the United States during 2016. We also believe dedicated golfers account for an outsize share of golf equipment and gear spending outside the United States and purchase a significant portion of golf wear products worldwide. Product Platform
 Leveraging the success of our golf ball and golf shoe businesses, while maintaining the core values of the Titleist and FootJoy brands, we have strategically entered into product categories such as golf clubs, wedges, putters, golf gloves, golf gear and golf wear with an objective of being the performance and quality leader.
 Since the dedicated golfer views each performance product category on its own merits, we have approached each category on its own terms by committing the necessary resources to become the performance and quality leader in each product category where we participate. As a result, we have built an industry leading platform across all performance product categories, driving a market‑differentiating mix of consumable products, which we consider to be golf balls and golf gloves, which collectively represented 40% of our net sales in 2016, and more durable products, which we consider to be golf clubs, golf shoes, golf apparel and golf gear, which collectively represented 60% of our net sales in 2016.
 We operate under the following four reportable segments. Financial information for our segments, including sales by geographic area, is included in “Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 20 – Segment Information.”

 Titleist Golf Balls (33% of 2016 net sales)
 Titleist is the #1 ball in golf. The Titleist golf ball was founded with a purpose of designing and manufacturing a performance oriented, high quality golf ball that was superior to all other products available in the market. We believe the golf ball is the most important piece of equipment in the game, as it is the only piece of equipment used by every player for every shot. The golf ball is also the most important category for us as it generates the largest portion of our sales and profits. Since its introduction in 2000, the Titleist Pro V1 has been the best‑selling golf ball globally and continues to set the bar in terms of product design, quality and performance. We also design, manufacture and sell other golf balls under the Titleist brand, such as NXT Tour, Velocity and DT TruSoft, as well as under the Pinnacle brand. We have continually improved our golf balls through innovation in materials, construction and manufacturing processes, which has enabled us to build the #1 golf ball franchise in the world.
 Titleist Golf Clubs (27% of 2016 net sales)
 We design, assemble and sell golf clubs (drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons) under the Titleist brand, wedges under the Vokey Design brand and putters under the Scotty Cameron brand. The mission of our golf club business is to design and develop the best performing golf clubs in the world for dedicated golfers. We believe dedicated golfers do not buy brands across categories but seek out best‑in‑class products in each category. This is the reason we have partnered with dedicated engineers and craftsmen such as Bob Vokey and Scotty Cameron, who understand the nuances, subtleties and impact mechanics of their respective golf club categories. Titleist golf clubs, Vokey Design wedges and Scotty Cameron putters are widely used by professional and competitive amateur players, which validates the products’ performance and quality excellence. We are also committed to a leading club fitting and trial platform to maximize dedicated golfers’ performance experience.
 Titleist Golf Gear (9% of 2016 net sales)
 We offer a diversified portfolio of Titleist‑branded performance golf gear across the golf bags, headwear, gloves, travel gear, head covers and other golf gear categories. Our golf gear is focused on superior performance and quality excellence, which is the mission of any product bearing the Titleist brand name.
 FootJoy Golf Wear (28% of 2016 net sales)
 We design, manufacture and sell golf shoes and gloves, and we design and sell performance outerwear, apparel and socks under the FootJoy brand. By offering products with premium materials, superior comfort and fit and authentic designs, FootJoy has become the #1 shoe and #1 glove in golf and a leader in the global performance golf outerwear and the U.S. golf apparel markets. We believe FootJoy is seen by golfers around the world as an authentic and definitive golf brand with a consistent, differentiated focus on performance and quality.
 Pyramid of Influence
 The game of golf is learned by observation and imitation, and golfers improve their own performance by attempting to emulate highly skilled golfers. Golfers are influenced not only by how other golfers swing but also by what they swing with and what they swing at. This is the essence of golf’s pyramid of influence, which is deeply ingrained in the mindset of the dedicated golfer. At the top of the pyramid is the most dedicated golfer, who attempts to make a living playing the game professionally. Adoption by most of the best golfers, whose professional success depends on their performance, validates the quality, features and benefits of using the best performing products. This, in turn, creates aspirational appeal for golfers who want to emulate the performance of the best players. By virtue of the performance and quality excellence of our products, we believe we are best‑positioned to leverage the pyramid of influence since most of the best players trust and use Titleist and FootJoy products. Our primary marketing strategy is for our products to be the most played by the best players, including both professional and amateur golfers. This strategy has proven to be enduring and effective in the long‑term and is not dependent on the transient success of a few elite players at any given point in time. Innovation Leadership
 We believe innovation is critical to dedicated golfers as they depend on the ability of new and innovative products to drive improved performance. Since we entered the golf ball business in 1932, we believe we have been the 

 
  8

 
design and technology leader in the golf industry with a strategy to develop, implement and protect product and process improvements. We currently employ an R&D team of over 180 scientists, chemists, engineers and technicians. We also introduce new product innovations at a cadence that best aligns with the typical dedicated golfer’s replacement cycle within each product category. We spent $48.8 million, $46.0 million and $44.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on R&D.
 Operational Excellence
 The requirements of the game lead the dedicated golfer to seek out products of maximum performance and consistency. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. In doing so, we are able to exercise control over every step of the manufacturing process and supply chain operations, thereby setting the standard for quality and consistency. Our operational excellence also allows us to continually develop innovative new products, bring those products to market more efficiently and ensure high levels of quality control. We have developed and refined distinct and independently managed supply chains for each of our product categories. Our manufacturing facilities include:
· | three golf ball manufacturing facilities that collectively produce over one million balls per production day;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | six golf club assembly facilities;
--+-----------------------------------


· | a joint venture facility to manufacture our golf shoes; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | a facility to manufacture our golf gloves.
--+-------------------------------------------

  Route to Market Leadership
 As one of the preferred partners to premium golf shops, we ensure that the performance benefits derived from using our products are showcased and our products are properly merchandised. We have over 340 sales representatives directly servicing nearly 31,000 accounts in 47 countries and we service over 90 countries in total, directly or through distributors. With an average of almost 20 years of experience, we believe the Titleist U.S. sales team is the largest and most experienced in the industry. Similarly, we believe FootJoy has built the most experienced, highly qualified team in the U.S. golf wear category. As we see our retail partners as a critical connection to dedicated golfers, we place great emphasis on building strong relationships and trust with them. This is the reason our sales associates are expected not simply to be salespeople, but to function as golf experts and enthusiasts in their respective territories, who advise and assist our retail partners to better serve their customers. We help generate golfer demand and sell‑through via in‑shop merchandising, promotions and advertising, and also provide product education to club professionals, coaches and instructors. Lastly, we place a strong focus on consumer engagement, starting with fitting and trial initiatives across our balls, clubs and shoes categories. We offer custom products across categories that we believe are better aligned with golfers’ personal styles, skill levels and preferences. Market Overview and Opportunity
 Market Overview
 We estimate that the sport of golf gives rise to a global commercial opportunity of more than $85 billion annually, which captures all spending related to golf. There are over 50 million golfers worldwide playing over 800 million rounds annually on over 32,000 golf courses. Our addressable market comprised of golf equipment, golf wear and golf gear represents approximately $12 billion in retail sales and approximately $8 billion in wholesale sales. The United States accounted for over 40% of our addressable market, followed by Japan and Korea collectively accounting for over 30% of our addressable market, each in 2016.
 According to Golf Datatech, LLC, the number of rounds of golf played in the United States has shown modest improvements in both 2015 and 2016. We believe the number of rounds of golf played by our target market of dedicated golfers has remained stable over the past few years.
 We view emerging economies, such as the markets in Southeast Asia, as attractive long‑term opportunities based on our assessment through the lens of the five collectively necessary and sufficient conditions for a country to 

 
  9

 
embrace golf: (1) sizeable middle‑class population; (2) educational infrastructure; (3) places to play and practice; (4) professional success that inspires the local golfers; and (5) corporate support.
 We believe the golf industry is mainly driven by golfer demographics, dedicated golfers and weather and economic conditions.
 Golfer Demographics. Golf is a recreational activity that requires time and money. The golf industry has been principally driven by the age cohort of 30 and above, currently “gen‑x” (age 30 to 49) and “baby boomers” (age 50 to 69), who have the time and money to engage in the sport. In the United States, there are approximately 8.7 million gen‑x golfers and approximately 6.6 million baby boomer golfers, representing approximately 63% of total golfers in the United States. Households headed by gen‑x and baby boomers also claim an approximately 80% share of the total income dollars in the United States. Since a significant number of baby boomers have yet to retire, we anticipate growth in spending from this demographic as it has been demonstrated that rounds of play increase significantly as those in this cohort reach retirement. On average, golfers in the age range of 18 to 34 play 15 rounds per year, whereas those in the age range of 50 to 64 and 65 and above play 29 rounds and 51 rounds per year, respectively. While golf has historically consisted of mostly male players, women accounted for approximately 24% of golfers in the United States in 2015, up from approximately 20% in 2011. Because nearly 40% of beginner golfers in the United States in 2015 were women, we believe that the percentage of women golfers will continue to grow. Beyond the gen‑x and baby boomer generation, another promising development in golf has been the generational shift with millennial golfers making their marks at both professional and amateur levels. Golfers under the age of 30 represented 36% of the World Rank Top 50 and 78% of Rolex World Rank Top 50 Women as of December 31, 2016. The largest single age group of beginners in the United States in 2015 was millennials (age 18 to 29). Further, the number of junior golfers (age 6 to 17) in the United States has grown from approximately 2.5 million golfers in 2010 to approximately 3.0 million golfers in 2015.
 Dedicated Golfers. Dedicated golfers are largely gen‑x and baby boomers who have demonstrated the propensity to pay a premium for products that help them perform better. We believe dedicated golfers, who comprise our target market, will continue to be a key driver for the global golf industry. The National Golf Foundation estimates that there were 6.2 million, 6.5 million and 6.4 million “avid” golfers in the United States in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with “avid” golfers defined as those who play 25 rounds or more per year. We estimate that approximately 60% of these avid golfers in the United States are dedicated golfers.
 Weather Conditions. Weather conditions determine the number of playable days in a year and thus influence the amount of time people spend on golf. Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year‑round, with many of our on‑course customers closed during the cold weather months. Therefore, favorable weather conditions generally result in more playable days in a given year and thus more golf rounds played, which generally results in increased demand for all golf products.
 Economic Conditions. The state of the economy influences the amount of money people spend on golf. Golf equipment, including clubs, balls and accessories, is recreational in nature and is therefore a discretionary purchase for consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products when economic conditions are favorable and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous.
 Our Opportunity
 We have demonstrated sustained, resilient and stable revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth over the past four years, despite challenges related to demographic, macroeconomic and weather related conditions. Our differentiated focus on performance and quality excellence, enduring connections with dedicated golfers and favorable and market‑differentiating mix of consumable and durable products have been the key drivers of our strong performance. We believe this focus positions us to continue to generate industry‑leading performance.

 Strong Financial Performance
 Since 2013, we have driven strong financial performance across our product portfolio in the aggregate and in each of our reportable segments of Titleist golf balls, Titleist golf clubs, Titleist golf gear and FootJoy golf wear. From 2013 to 2016:
· | our net sales increased from $1,477 million to $1,572 million, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. was $19.6 million in 2013 and $45.0 million in 2016;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our Adjusted EBITDA increased from $190.4 million to $228.4 million, representing a CAGR of 6%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we achieved 160 basis points of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our cash flows provided by operating activities increased from $78.8 million to $105.2 million.

 Our Competitive Strengths
 Steward of Golf’s Most Revered Brands. We have long been the trusted steward of two of golf’s most revered and recognized brands, and have enjoyed the longest running record of market leadership in the golf category. We believe the Titleist and FootJoy brands deliver superior performance and quality excellence in their respective product categories and are widely regarded as the strongest and most identifiable brands among premium golf equipment and golf wear manufacturers. Titleist has been the #1 ball in professional golf for 68 years while FootJoy has been the leading brand on the PGA Tour in golf shoes for over six decades and golf gloves for over three decades. The performance and quality of our brands are validated by the widespread adoption of our products by the world’s best professional and amateur golfers, which generates exceptional brand loyalty among our core customers and drives repeat purchases.
 Market‑Leading Portfolio of Products Designed for Dedicated Golfers. The Titleist Pro V1 golf ball was launched in 2000 and in four months became the #1 selling ball on the market, a position it still holds, and is the #1 golf 

 
  11

 
ball played at every level of competitive golf today. We estimate that we held nearly one‑half of the 2015 global top grade wholesale golf ball market, which we estimate was approximately $1.0 billion, including over two‑thirds of the premium performance market segment. Pro V1 models are the longest running #1 of any golf equipment since Golf Datatech began tracking this metric in 1997. It is rare when a brand’s highest priced product in a particular category is also the industry volume leader. In 2016, the number of Titleist balls played on professional tours was more than five times the number of balls of our nearest competitor. Titleist records even higher ball counts at most amateur championships than on the worldwide professional tours, a further testament to the performance and quality of Titleist. Since amateurs are not allowed to receive compensation for the use or endorsement of any brand’s equipment, they freely choose what golf ball they believe will help them shoot their lowest scores. Faithful to the brand promise of the Titleist ball, we believe our golf clubs are also best‑in‑class in terms of performance and quality. Our Vokey Design wedges and Scotty Cameron putters are recognized worldwide as leaders in their respective categories. Our Vokey Design wedges are the most widely used on the PGA Tour. Under our FootJoy brand, we are the #1 shoe in golf, with the leading usage on all of the world’s major professional golf tours and twice as many stock keeping units, or SKUs, as our nearest competitors. FootJoy gloves also have the leading market share, enjoy the #1 position on all the world’s major professional golf tours, and offer the largest selection of golf gloves in the industry. FootJoy is also a global leader in golf outerwear and has a rapidly growing presence in golf apparel.
 Favorable Consumable / Durable Mix. We have developed a product portfolio with a favorable mix of consumables and durables, which we believe differentiates us from other pure golf equipment manufacturers. Consumable purchases are largely driven by the number of rounds played, while durable purchases are subject to technology replacement cycles. We believe our favorable product mix is less economically cyclical and more working capital efficient than that of our peers. Our sales reflect a favorable and market‑differentiating mix of consumable products, which we consider to be golf balls and golf gloves, which collectively represented 40% of our net sales in 2016, and more durable products, which we consider to be golf clubs, golf shoes, golf apparel and golf gear, which collectively represented 60% of our net sales in 2016.
 Best‑in‑Class Design Innovation. Driven by our commitment to perpetual innovation, we believe we are the innovation leader in the golf industry. Golf’s most regulated and technically‑driven categories are golf balls and golf clubs, and therefore require strong intellectual property to create differentiated products with superior performance and quality. We hold the largest patent portfolio in the golf industry, with over 1,250 active U.S. utility patents in golf balls, close to 350 active U.S. utility patents in golf clubs, wedges and putters and 296 active patents (including ex‑U.S. and design patents) in golf shoes and gloves. As of December 31, 2016, we had 37% and 15% market shares of active golf ball and club patents, respectively. Over 90% of our current products incorporate technologies or designs developed in the last five years. The Titleist Pro V1 franchise is an example of our innovation leadership. We have sold over 130 million dozen Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls, generating over $4.5 billion of revenue, since the introduction of the Pro V1 in 2000. We believe our ability to develop and implement innovation drives superior product performance and our patent portfolio allows us to protect our product and process improvements in an industry where success is driven by product performance and quality improvements.
 Operational Excellence. Our differentiated manufacturing processes and connectivity between our manufacturing and R&D teams foster integration throughout the design and manufacturing process. This allows us to continually develop innovative new products that we can bring to market efficiently while ensuring consistency and high levels of quality control. Unlike many other golf companies, we own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. Our vertically integrated approach delivers a consistent product quality and results in very high customer satisfaction. There are over 90 quality checks for Titleist Pro V1 and 120 quality checks that go into Titleist Pro V1x to ensure every ball is worthy of bearing the Titleist brand name. An example of this is our product quality return percentage—for every 10 million Titleist Pro V1 golf balls produced, only one is returned on average. By controlling key aspects of the design and manufacturing processes, we are better able to protect our intellectual property as well as offer customization capabilities and efficient turn times. Furthermore, we are able to provide custom fitted products to individuals in a short timeframe and facilitate regional market customization.
 Unparalleled Route to Market Leadership. The foundation of our go‑to‑market strategy is to continue to be the preferred partner for premium golf shops worldwide and to provide customization and fitting that optimize our customers’ post‑purchase experiences. In doing so, we ensure that the performance benefits derived from using our products are showcased and our products are properly merchandised, while deepening our customers’ connections with the Titleist and FootJoy brands. We believe these initiatives, in turn, increase sales and profitability for our retail partners, leading to a mutually beneficial economic relationship. Today, we deploy over 20,000 displays that are 

 
  12

 
designed and adapted to local needs, and there are over 3,500 premium golf shops that exclusively stock or display Titleist balls. By virtue of our strong relationship with retail partners, we are able to build the strong connections with and gain deep understanding of dedicated golfers. We are able to closely track the replacement cycles of our customers’ equipment and effectively market our new products in a timely manner.
 Deep Stewardship Culture and Experienced Management Team. Behind our exceptional products and organizational infrastructure lies an authentic and enduring organizational culture validated by the longevity of our management team, sales force and associates. Our management team members, many of whom have dedicated their entire careers to our company, average over 19 years of employment with us. They are supported by a deep and talented team of associates across product categories, functions, markets and geographies, who serve as strong brand and cultural ambassadors. Approximately 50% of our U.S. associates have over ten years of employment with us, highlighting the depth of our talent and future leaders. We are the stewards of our brands, and we are committed to maintaining the culture of excellence that defines us and our products.
 Our Growth Strategies
 We plan to continue to pursue organic growth initiatives across all product categories, brands, geographies and marketing channels.
 Introduce New Products and Extend Market Share Leadership in Equipment Categories. We expect to sustain our strong performance in our core categories of golf balls and golf clubs through several targeted strategies:
· | Titleist Golf Balls. To ensure sustained long‑term market leadership, we are continuously investing in design innovation and refining our sell‑in and sell‑through route to market capabilities and effectiveness in the golf ball product category. We are currently focused on improving our sales team training in product, merchandising, local promotion and selling skills, as well as enhancing trade partnerships in those channels where dedicated golfers shop. To grow our custom golf ball business, we have in place several new initiatives designed to develop strategic partnerships with corporations heavily invested in golf and to drive growth with a particular focus on the areas of corporate, country club, tournament and personalized sales. The 2016 launch of the “My Pro V1 Shop” online golf shop allows golfers to create and purchase their own unique Titleist Pro V1 / Pro V1x golf balls with special play numbers, logos or personalization. We believe the website will increase the likelihood of repeat purchases, thereby strengthening the link with golfers and loyalty to Titleist golf balls. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Titleist Clubs, Wedges and Putters. We intend to continue to launch innovative, performance golf clubs by further leveraging Titleist clubs’ leading R&D platform. We believe concept and specialty products and premium quality digital content will further drive customer awareness and market share gains across all premium club categories. To enhance trial and fitting, we plan to continue our leading consumer connection initiatives, grow our fitting network in opportunistic markets and further promote the utilization of our distinctive fitting operations. We are also executing several initiatives to further elevate Vokey Design wedges and Scotty Cameron putters as golf’s leaders in short‑game performance, technology, craftsmanship, and selection. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Increase Penetration in Golf Gear and Wear Categories. We intend to build on the brand loyalty that the dedicated golfer has developed for our Titleist ball and club categories and FootJoy shoe and glove categories in order to increase our penetration in the adjacent categories of golf gear and golf wear. We expect to continue to drive growth across these categories by employing the following initiatives:

· | Titleist Golf Gear. We are committed to providing dedicated golfers with golf gear—including golf bags, headwear, gloves, travel gear, head covers and other accessories—of performance and quality excellence that is faithful to the Titleist brand promise. We are making significant investments in design and engineering resources and are leveraging dedicated player research methodologies and insights to drive innovation in this product category. We also plan to expand custom and limited edition product offerings. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FootJoy Women’s Apparel Initiative. We are currently building out a focused, performance‑based FootJoy women’s apparel line consistent with the brand’s successful positioning in men’s apparel. The women’s apparel line, which launched in early 2016, pairs sophisticated performance fabrics and design with 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

layering technology pioneered by FootJoy to create maximum comfort and protection. By leveraging our existing FootJoy sales force in an adjacent category, we believe we can offer a compelling and authentic solution to female golfers and capitalize on the trend of casual, athletic styling that is driving success in the broader women’s apparel space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FootJoy eCommerce Launch. We launched a U.S. eCommerce website for FootJoy in 2016. Over 6,000 SKUs are offered across all FootJoy categories, including shoes, gloves and apparel. The eCommerce initiative is expected to yield incremental sales and profitability, enriched data on preferences and trends as well as foster a deeper and more real time connection with the dedicated golfer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Strategically Pursue Global Growth. The Titleist and FootJoy brands are both global brands that are well positioned where golf’s growth is anticipated. While we believe that a majority of the near‑term growth will be driven by the developed economies, emerging economies, such as the markets in Southeast Asia, represent longer‑term growth opportunities. To meet future demand, we are ensuring that local capabilities and expertise in sales, customer service, merchandising, online presence, golf education and fitting initiatives are in place to support our operations. We continue to hire local talent across all functions in order to better position the products of Titleist and FootJoy in those markets where participation and popularity of the sport are expected to increase.
 Our Products
 We design, manufacture and market a broad range of products under the Titleist and FootJoy brands. Both brands are recognized as industry leaders in performance, quality, innovation and design. Our products include golf balls, golf clubs, wedges and putters, golf shoes, golf gloves, golf gear and golf outerwear and apparel.

      Titleist
 We design, manufacture and sell golf balls, golf clubs, wedges and putters and golf gear under the Titleist brand. Net sales of Titleist products for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1,139.2 million, $1,084.1 million, and $1,116.0 million, respectively, in each case approximately 72% of our total net sales. Titleist Golf Balls
 Titleist is the #1 ball in golf. The 2016 Titleist golf ball product line consisted of six major models, each designed to deliver different performance characteristics, such as distance, flight, short game control, feel and durability.

 Pro V1 and Pro V1x are designed to be the highest performing and quality golf balls for golfers at every level of the game and best demonstrate Titleist’s design, innovation and technology leadership. The first Pro V1 golf ball was introduced on the PGA Tour in October 2000 and launched to the market in December 2000. It represented the coalescence of three of Titleist’s industry leading technologies: large solid core; multi‑component construction; and high performance, thermoset cast urethane elastomer covers. In its first four months, the Pro V1 golf ball became the best‑selling golf ball and holds that position to this day. During this time, we also set out to create a ball that produced lower driver spin and higher launch characteristics than the Pro V1 while retaining its high performance scoring spin. With its four‑piece, dual core design, the Pro V1x golf ball was introduced in 2003. In 2017, we launched new versions of the Pro V1 and Pro V1x. The New Pro V1 is designed to offer significantly longer distance from faster ball speed and lower long game spin. Advancements in aerodynamics for both Pro V1 and Pro V1x are designed to produce even more consistent flight. We believe these improvements, along with benefits such as our renowned Drop-and-Stop control, soft feel and long lasting durability, make Pro V1 golf balls the best performance choice for all golfers.
 We also provide best‑in‑class performance with the NXT Tour, NXT Tour S, Velocity and DT TruSoft models.
 By competing at a lower price point, Pinnacle completes a full product offering for us. With two major models, Rush and Soft, Pinnacle golf balls are also available in different optic colors and play numbers. Our Pinnacle Brand competes in the price market segment, which allows the Titleist brand to focus on the premium performance and performance market segments and reduces the need to extend the Titleist brand to the price market segment. This also helps to support the thousands of golf shops that choose to exclusively stock Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls, allowing them to offer golf balls in each market segment which market segments we discussed and defined below.
 Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls accounted for $513.9 million, or 33%, $535.5 million, or 36%, and $543.8 million, or 35%, of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 We estimate that we held nearly one‑half of the 2015 global top grade wholesale golf ball market, which we estimate was approximately $1.0 billion, and held leadership positions across the most profitable market segments. The top grade wholesale golf ball market consists of all golf balls sold in the wholesale market excluding range golf balls, practice golf balls or downgraded or repurposed golf balls.

· | The premium performance market segment (which we estimate was approximately $490 million of the 2015 global top grade wholesale golf ball market), which we consider to be golf balls that are designed to maximize total performance across all product attributes, including distance, short game spin and control, feel and durability. Titleist Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls led the premium performance segment with over two‑thirds of this market segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The performance market segment (which we estimate was approximately $380 million of the 2015 global top grade wholesale golf ball market), which we consider to be golf balls that are designed to prioritize distance, good short game spin and control, feel and durability, while maintaining a lower price point than balls that compete in the premium performance market segment. Titleist NXT Tour, Velocity and DT golf balls led the performance segment with approximately one‑third of this market segment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The price market segment (which we estimate was approximately $180 million of the 2015 global top grade wholesale golf ball market), which we consider to be golf balls that are designed to prioritize distance, feel and durability, while targeting a more affordable price point than balls that compete in the premium performance and performance market segments. We are a leader in the price market segment.

 The table below shows the percentage of golfers that used Titleist golf balls as compared to its nearest competitor for specific professional tours and representative amateur championships in 2016.

 As shown in the table above, at most amateur championships, Titleist records even higher ball counts than on the worldwide professional tours. Under The Rules of Golf established by the game’s governing bodies, the USGA and R&A, amateurs are not allowed to receive compensation for the use or endorsement of any brand’s equipment. Amateurs freely choose what golf ball they believe will help them shoot their lowest scores. We believe their choice of the Titleist golf ball further validates the superior performance and superior quality of Titleist.
 We are also a leader in custom imprinted golf balls. This includes printing high quality reproductions of corporate logos, tournament logos, country club or resort logos, and personalization on Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls. Our service includes design capabilities, special packaging options and fast turnaround times. Custom imprinted golf balls represented over 30% of our global net golf ball sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of custom imprinting is done for corporate logos as there has long been a strong connection between the business community and golf.
 Titleist Golf Clubs, Wedges and Putters
 We view and operate the Titleist golf club business in three distinct categories: clubs (which includes drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons), wedges and putters. Our products are generally priced at or above the premium price points in the marketplace, driven by higher‑end technologies (including design, materials and processes) we employ to generate superior quality and performance. We have different models within each category to address the distinct performance needs of our dedicated golfer target audience. Titleist golf clubs, wedges and putters accounted for $431.0 million, or 27%, $388.3 million, or 26%, and $422.4 million, or 27%, of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

 The table below shows the usage percentages and ranks of Titleist golf clubs, wedges and putters on the 2016 PGA Tour and representative 2016 championships in the United States.

 Titleist Clubs
 Our current global club line consists of the 917 product line of drivers and fairways, the 816 product line of hybrids and the 716 product line of irons. Every product in our club line features premium, tour‑proven stock shafts and grips, complemented by a broad range of custom options.
 Titleist 917 drivers and fairways are designed to deliver superior performance through tour‑proven technologies that increase ball speed, decrease spin, and optimize flight without sacrificing forgiveness. We design our drivers and fairways to deliver complete performance with tour‑preferred looks, sound and feel, and we offer the ability to precisely fit individual golfers’ needs.
 Titleist 816 hybrids generate long game performance through advanced technology. The advanced features of our hybrids aim to facilitate precision fitting and generate high ball speed, low spin and high launch for increased distance and forgiveness.
 Titleist 716 irons are innovative, technologically advanced products designed to deliver distance, forgiveness, proper shot control and feel. While we offer stock set configurations for our iron sets, approximately 56% of our worldwide iron sales are custom fit to help deliver a better fit and performance.
 We also sell our VG3 line of clubs, which consist of men’s and women’s drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons offered in Japan only. These products feature design and construction specifically targeted to dedicated golfers in Japan.
 Vokey Design Wedges
 Bob Vokey champions the Titleist wedge effort by creating high performance wedges to meet the demands of dedicated golfers and the best players in the world. The Vokey Design wedge product offering is a compilation of the most popular wedges resulting from Bob Vokey’s hands‑on work with golf’s best players to develop shapes and soles that address varying techniques and course conditions. In total, we offer 21 unique loft, sole grind and bounce combinations and three unique finishes to create golf’s most complete wedge product performance range. In addition, Vokey’s online Wedgeworks program promotes limited edition models and allows golfers to customize and personalize their wedges. Vokey Design wedges are the most played wedges by tour professionals. In 2016, they accounted for over 46% of all wedges in play on the PGA Tour, where they have been #1 every year since 2004.

 Scotty Cameron Putters
 Scotty Cameron Fine Milled Putters are developed through a specialized and iterative process that blends art and science to create high performance putters. Scotty’s design inspiration begins with studying the best players in the world and working with them to identify the consistent strengths and attributes of their putting. Scotty Cameron encourages a selection process that identifies the putter length, toe flow and appearance to deliver proper balance, shaft flex and feel to golfers and to encourage proper technique. Scotty Cameron putters consist of a range of products for each of these key selection criteria. In 2016, over one‑third of the putters played on the PGA Tour were Scotty Cameron putters, and over the past 21 years, Scotty Cameron putters have helped players win over 1,200 tournaments on the worldwide professional tours.
 Using the scottycameron.com website as an information and services hub, we offer loyal brand fans the opportunity to connect more closely with the Scotty Cameron brand. Golfers can customize and personalize their putter(s) in the online Scotty Cameron Custom Shop. Through the popular “Club Cameron” loyalty program and Scotty’s online “Studio Store,” brand fans can purchase unique Scotty Cameron accessories. In 2014, we also opened the Scotty Cameron Gallery in Encinitas, California, and in 2016, we entered into a license agreement whereby a third party opened and operates a similar facility in Tokyo, Japan. Each of these facilities is a premium retail boutique which offers consumers the ability to experience the tour fitting process as well as purchase unique accessory items.
 Titleist Golf Gear
 Titleist golf gear products are designed and engineered using premium materials, paying particular attention to superior performance, function and style. We focus on the design and development of golf bags, headwear, gloves, travel gear, head covers and other golf gear. We provide personalization and customization within each category of Titleist golf gear, as well as certain licensed products, in order to meet the needs of the dedicated golfer and as part of our service to our accounts. We believe the golf gear business represents a sizable but highly fragmented opportunity with numerous competitors in each product category and geographical market. Titleist golf gear accounted for $136.2 million, or 9%, $129.4 million, or 9%, and $127.9 million, or 8%, of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 Titleist golf gear includes:

· | Golf Bags. Our golf bags are designed and engineered with a variety of models possessing distinct features and benefits, including our Tour Staff, Cart and Carry models. The Titleist Tour Staff, Cart and Carry golf bags are leading products sold at premium prices throughout our worldwide distribution network. According to Golf Datatech, our share of U.S. net sales of golf bags from on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers was approximately 19% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our principal competitors in this category include Sun Mountain, Ping and Callaway.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Headwear. Titleist headwear is designed and developed with advanced fabrications and construction to provide performance benefits as well as desirable styling for the dedicated golfer.

  FootJoy Golf Wear
 FootJoy is one of golf’s leading performance wear brands, which consists collectively of golf shoes, gloves and apparel. FootJoy products accounted for $433.1 million, or 28%, $418.9 million, or 28%, and $421.6 million, or 27%, of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. FootJoy Golf Shoes
 FootJoy is the #1 shoe in golf and has been the #1 shoe on the PGA Tour for over six decades. With an exclusive focus on golf, FootJoy shoes are designed, developed and manufactured for all golfers in all golf shoe categories, including traditional, casual, athletic and spikeless. We are the global leader in golf shoes with approximately one‑third of the 2016 global wholesale golf shoe market, which we estimate was approximately $575 million.
 The golf shoe category is one of the most demanding of all wearables as golf shoes must perform in all weather conditions, including extreme temperature and moisture exposure; be resistant to pesticides and fungicides; withstand frequent usage and extensive rounds of play; and provide consistent comfort, support and protection to the golfer in an average of over five miles in a walked round. Hence, golf shoes require extensive knowledge and expertise in foot morphology, walking and swing biomechanics, material science and application and sophisticated manufacturing and construction techniques.
 Golf shoes are also a style and fashion driven category. FootJoy offers a large assortment of styles to suit the needs and tastes of all golfers. Although it has products that cater to all segments of the value chain, 90% of its 118 styles in the United States golf shoe offering as of December 31, 2015 were in the super premium (greater than $150 MSRP) or premium (greater than $100 MSRP) revenue categories. The breadth and scope of the FootJoy product line is commensurate with its leading sales position. To maintain and grow this leadership position in the category, new product launches and new styles comprise over 60% of its offerings each year in all significant markets around the world.
 Although FootJoy seeks the greatest use at all levels of the game, it enjoys the leading usage by the most of the best players. The table below shows the percentage of professional golfers that used FootJoy shoes as compared to its nearest competitor for representative professional tours in 2016.

 In addition to its stock offerings, FootJoy is a leader in the customization of golf shoe styles and designs. FootJoy’s MyJoys custom golf shoe portal provides individual choices for style, color, personal IDs and team logos that are produced to order for golfers around the world. We believe it is the largest choice offering in the golf shoe category and provides a service and personal expression capability that creates brand loyalty and repeat purchases.

 FootJoy Gloves
 FootJoy is the #1 glove in golf. We are the global leader in golf gloves with approximately one‑third of the 2015 global wholesale golf glove market, which we estimate was approximately $230 million. FootJoy is over three times larger than Titleist in the category, which is the #2 brand worldwide in sales. FootJoy is the leader in sales for all sub‑categories of the glove business, including leather construction, synthetic, leather/synthetic combinations and all specialty gloves including rain and winter specific offerings.
 As in the golf shoe category, FootJoy has a long standing leadership position in the glove business that is the result of a deep understanding of golfer needs and expectations for performance, fit, comfort and quality. FootJoy offers the largest variety of glove designs and specifications to meet the needs of all golfers, including high quality, thin leather construction, advanced synthetics and leather/synthetic combinations, and specialty applications such as the world’s leading rain and winter golf gloves. FootJoy has enjoyed leadership of the category since the mid‑1980s and is the market leader in every significant golf market around the world. The table below shows the percentage of professional golfers that used FootJoy and Titleist gloves as compared to their nearest competitor for representative professional tours in 2016.

 FootJoy Outerwear and Apparel
 FootJoy’s most recent brand extensions have been the entry into the golf outerwear and golf apparel markets. FootJoy’s goal for outerwear is to “make every day playable” and extend the golf season by providing products for rain, wind and cold conditions. FootJoy entered the outerwear category in 1996 with innovative designs and materials and became the leader in net sales in the United States by 2005 and still holds this position today. According to Golf Datatech, our share of U.S. net sales of golf outerwear from on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers was approximately 27% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our principal competitors in this category include Nike, Zero Restriction and Adidas. The brand’s longer term goal is to establish itself as the #1 golf outerwear product worldwide.
 The FootJoy outerwear line is predicated on the FootJoy Layering System with three layers: base layer for moisture management, mid layer for temperature control and an outer layer for weather protection. The layer system allows for easy adjustment on the course with maximum comfort and protection. As in its successful golf shoe and glove categories, FootJoy outerwear built its leadership position in the United States by utilizing premium materials and design know‑how to build a complete offering of specialized products to meet the unique needs of the golfer in all weather extremes.
 FootJoy fully entered the adjacent category of general golf apparel in 2012 with a tightly focused offering for men in the U.S. market. The line was extended to markets in Europe and Asia in the following years and now enjoys wide appeal and a growing share in most markets around the world. We believe it is one of the fastest growing brands in the men’s general golf apparel market. According to Golf Datatech, our share of U.S. net sales of men’s general golf apparel and outerwear from on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers was approximately 11% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The general golf apparel market represents a sizable but highly fragmented opportunity with numerous competitors in each geographical market, including Nike, Adidas and Under Armour.

 
  20

 

 FootJoy more broadly entered the U.S. women’s golf apparel market in early 2016 under the trademark Golfleisure. The styling is appropriate for golf and inspired by the current athleisure segment of women’s apparel in other categories and uses. According to Golf Datatech our share of U.S. net sales of women’s golf apparel and outerwear from on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers was approximately 3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our principal competitors in this category include Nike, EP Pro and Adidas. Plans include expansion of distribution to other markets in Europe and Asia during 2017.
 Product Launch Cycles
 We maintain differentiated and disciplined product launch cycles across our portfolio, which has contributed to stable and resilient growth over the long‑run. This approach gives our R&D teams a period of time we believe is necessary to develop superior performing products versus the prior generation models. As a result, we are able to manage our product transitions and inventory from one generation to the next more efficiently and effectively, both internally and with our trade partners.
 Product introductions generally stimulate net sales as the golf retail channel takes on inventory of new products. Reorders of these new products then depend on the rate of sell‑through. Announcements of new products can often cause our customers to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until our new products are available. The varying product introduction cycles described below may cause our results of operations to fluctuate as each product line has different volumes, prices and margins.
 Titleist Golf Balls Segment
 We launch new Titleist golf ball models on a two‑year cycle, with new product launches of Pro V1 and Pro V1x, our premium performance models, generally occurring in the first quarter of odd‑numbered years and new product launches of NXT Tour, Velocity and DT, our performance models, generally occurring in the first quarter of even‑numbered years. For new golf ball models, sales occur at a higher rate in the year of the initial launch than in the second year. Given the Pro V1 franchise is our highest volume and our highest priced product, we typically have higher net sales in our Titleist golf ball segment in odd‑numbered years. Titleist Golf Clubs Segment
 We generally launch new Titleist golf club models on a two‑year cycle. Since the fall of 2014, we have generally used the following product launch cycle, and at present we anticipate continuing to use this product launch cycle going forward because we believe it aligns our launches with the purchase habits of dedicated golfers. In general, we launch:
· | drivers and fairways in the fourth quarter of even‑numbered years, which typically results in an increase in sales of drivers and fairways during such quarter because retailers take on initial supplies of these products as stock inventory, with increased sales generated by such new products continuing the following spring or summer of odd‑numbered years;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | irons and hybrids in the fourth quarter of odd‑numbered years, with the majority of sales generated by such new products occurring in the following spring or summer of even‑numbered years because a higher percentage of our new irons and hybrids as compared to our drivers and fairways are sold through on a custom fit basis and the spring or summer is when golfers tend to make such custom fit purchases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Vokey Design wedges in the first quarter of even‑numbered years, with the majority of sales generated by such new products occurring in the spring or summer of such even‑numbered years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scotty Cameron putters in the first quarter, with the Select models launched in even‑numbered years and the Futura models launched in odd‑numbered years, with the majority of sales generated by such new products occurring in the spring or summer of the year in which they are launched; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Japan‑specific VG3 drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons in the first quarter of even‑numbered years, with the majority of sales generated by such new products occurring in the spring and summer of such even‑numbered years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  21

 

 As a result of this product launch cycle, we generally expect to have higher net sales in our Titleist golf club segment in even‑numbered years due to the following factors:

· | the majority of sales generated by new irons and hybrids launched in the fourth quarter of odd‑numbered years is expected to occur in the spring and summer of the following even‑numbered years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the majority of sales generated by new Vokey Design wedges launched in the first quarter of even‑numbered years is expected to occur in such even‑numbered years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the majority of sales generated by new Scotty Cameron Select line of putters launched in the first quarter of even‑numbered years is expected to occur in such even‑numbered years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the majority of sales generated by new Japan‑specific VG3 drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons launched in the first quarter of even‑numbered years is expected to occur in such even‑numbered years; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the increase in sales of new drivers and fairways launched in the fourth quarter of even‑numbered years due to the initial sell‑in of these products during such quarter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Titleist Golf Gear and FootJoy Golf Wear Segments
 Our FootJoy golf wear and Titleist golf gear businesses are not subject to the same degree of cyclical fluctuation as our golf ball and golf club businesses as new product offerings and styles are generally introduced each year and at different times during the year.

 Manufacturing Excellence
 Our manufacturing processes and management of supply chain operations ensure consistency of product performance and quality. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. Manufacturing Network

 Our manufacturing network is comprised of our owned facilities and select partners around the globe. Our scale and global reach enable us to maximize cost efficiency, reduce lead time, provide regional customization and gain insights into local markets.
 We are the largest scope and scale golf ball manufacturer in the world with three company‑owned and operated manufacturing facilities, two located in the United States and one in Thailand, encompassing 600,000 total square feet with sufficient production capacity to meet anticipated growth. We also have local custom golf ball imprinting operations in the United States, Japan, Canada, the U.K. (servicing the U.K., Ireland and continental Europe), Korea and China to deliver superior reproduction quality and service. We utilize qualified local vendors for imprinting capabilities in other geographic markets.
 We assemble clubs at six strategic global locations, allowing us to provide custom fitted golf clubs with regional customization with efficient turnaround times. Each of our six custom manufacturing locations is responsible for supply chain execution for golf clubs and wedges, from forecast generation to component procurement to club assembly and distribution, allowing each region to respond to market specific needs or trends. Scotty Cameron putters are assembled solely at our Carlsbad, California manufacturing facility.
 We own and operate the largest golf glove manufacturing operation in the world in Chonburi, Thailand which employs nearly 1,500 workers, where we manufacture both FootJoy and Titleist golf gloves. The factory produces over 10 million FootJoy and Titleist gloves annually.
 All of our FootJoy golf shoes are manufactured in a 525,000 square foot facility in Fuzhou, China, owned by a joint venture in which we have a 40% interest with the remaining 60% owned by our long‑standing Taiwan supply partners. In our consolidated financial statements, we consolidate the accounts of our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture, which is a variable interest entity, or VIE. The joint venture was established in 1995 and has been in its current facility since 2000. The sole purpose of the joint venture is to manufacture our golf shoes and as such we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE as defined by ASC 810. The multi‑floor/multi‑building complex owned by the joint 

 
  23

 
venture is devoted exclusively to FootJoy golf shoes, has production capacity of nearly five million pairs per annum and is staffed by over 2,700 workers. See “Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Components of our Results of Operations—Noncontrolling Interests” for a discussion of our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture and the material terms of the agreement which governs such joint venture arrangement.
 Vertical Integration
 Our vertically integrated approach to manufacturing is at the core of our consistent product quality and resulting high customer satisfaction. Our golf balls, golf gloves and golf shoes operations enjoy significant vertical integration, whereby we design each product, source the raw materials, and then manufacture, finish and package at our owned facilities. We design our golf clubs, golf wear and golf gear products internally and source the components or finished goods from select vendors that develop and manufacture our designs. We structure our manufacturing and sourcing operations based on the availability of best‑in‑class manufacturers and vendors. We choose to maintain a vertically integrated approach in those product categories where we believe there are no third‑party vendors who meet our high standards and where we are able to achieve economies of scale.
 The golf ball supply chain is our most vertically integrated and our golf ball operations team works closely with our R&D teams and key raw material suppliers. We design every Titleist and Pinnacle golf ball, source the raw materials, and then manufacture, finish and package over one million golf balls per production day.
 FootJoy has a long standing history of successful vertically integrated manufacturing in its shoe and glove businesses. We design all facets of the shoe, including upper patterns, insoles, outsoles and traction elements. Raw materials for the uppers and insoles and component parts for the outsoles and traction elements are sourced around the world through independent third party suppliers. All of our golf shoes are then manufactured in our joint venture facility in Fuzhou, China. In our golf glove business, we design each product, source all raw materials and then manufacture substantially all of the finished products.
 Our Titleist golf club operations team works closely with our R&D teams and key component suppliers to design and produce technologically advanced and high quality clubs, wedges and putters. Their collective efforts continue to identify and employ new materials, new processes and new machinery that are used to improve performance and quality, as well as to reduce lead times and product costs. Lastly, each product is inspected prior to shipment at point of origin by the supplier, and in the case of heads, also by our own quality personnel, and all products are audited at the receiving facility.
 A coordinated internal team designs and sources the finished goods for all FootJoy outerwear and apparel products. Over the last twenty years, we have created long‑standing relationships with several independent supply groups that have expertise and quality capabilities consistent with FootJoy’s high standards and specifications. No one source of supply provides more than 50% of our annual needs in these categories.
 Raw Materials, Product Components and Finished Goods Supply and Sourcing
 We have aligned with a select few industry leaders capable of meeting our quality standards and performance requirements with respect to the supply of our raw materials, product components and finished goods.
 For our golf balls business, we carefully select our raw materials as well as our sources based on quality, cost efficiency and risk management. Our highest raw material consumption for golf balls, in order, is polybutadiene, ionomers, zinc diacrylate (ZDA), urethane, and coatings. To mitigate risk of supply disruption of polybutadiene or ionomers, we manage inventory levels and store additional inventory during the traditional hurricane season in the United States because certain significant suppliers have in the past and may in the future be impacted by hurricanes. For polybutadiene, ZDA, urethane and coatings, we use either multiple suppliers or multiple production facilities, some with geographic separation, to reduce the risk of raw material shortages. Additionally, we utilize a cloud‑based global supplier risk monitoring tool which provides alerts in our supply chain in areas such as financial/credit, geographic/climactic, political, organizational changes, transportation and labor/wages.
 We source the raw materials for our golf glove and golf shoe businesses, and certain of the components for our golf shoe business, from a select group of third‑party suppliers.

 
  24

 

 We have excellent long term relationships with our Titleist golf club supplier partners, and they supply the majority of our more than 4,000 component SKUs. These key partnerships have allowed us to reduce lead times by an average of 60% over the past five years, while also reducing component and finished goods inventory, ensuring on‑hand availability, increasing our responsiveness to customer demand and improving supply chain continuity. In addition, the Titleist golf club team employs nine on-site auditors at our Asian suppliers’ production facilities to ensure consistent product quality.
 For our golf gear businesses, we source the finished products from select third‑party vendors that have the necessary quality capabilities.
 FootJoy operates an apparel and accessory commercial office in Hong Kong that is staffed with eight associates. These individuals are highly trained in all aspects of apparel design and development, production, and quality control functions, directing all commercial sourcing activities among contract factories throughout the region. In addition to the eight associates in Hong Kong, FootJoy also employs two quality control inspectors in China and one in Vietnam for careful monitoring of all FootJoy apparel production.
 Sales and Distribution
 Our accounts consist of premium golf shops, which include on‑course golf shops and golf specialty retailers, as well as other qualified retailers that sell golf products to consumers worldwide. We have a selective sales and distribution strategy, differentiated by product line and geography, which focuses on effectively serving those accounts that provide best access to our dedicated golfer target market in each geographic market.
 We operate, and have our own field sales representation, in those countries that represent the substantial majority of golf equipment and wearable sales, including the United States, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Sweden, France, Greater China, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. In other countries in which we sell our products, we rely on select distributors in order to deepen our reach into those markets. Each country administers its own in‑country channel of distribution strategy given the unique characteristics of each market.
 As we see our retail partners as a critical connection to dedicated golfers, we place great emphasis on building strong relationships and trust with them. As a result, our sales and distribution takes a “category management” approach that encompasses all aspects of customer service and fulfillment, including product selection; space and display planning; sales staff training; and inventory control and replenishment. Each sales representative is seen as a trusted partner and skilled consultant, including on topics such as shop layout, merchandise display techniques and effective use of signage and product information and methods of improving inventory turns and sales conversions through merchandising. Our sales force has been recognized worldwide for its professionalism and service excellence.
 We employ over 340 sales representatives worldwide, who are compensated through a combination of salary and a performance bonus. In the United States, members of our Titleist and FootJoy sales team average almost 20 years of experience. We currently service nearly 31,000 direct accounts worldwide. In both our direct sales and distributor markets, our trade partners are subject to our redistribution policy.
 Titleist has developed a global distribution network in which most of the major golf regions have local distribution operations that maintain inventories for exceptional service and fulfillment of stock products. Local custom operations, for both golf balls and golf clubs, provide efficient turnaround time on custom imprinted or custom fitted products. In addition, Titleist promotes its partners as the equipment and fitting experts and encourages golfers to seek their expertise and advice. Together, Titleist and its partners enrich the golfer experience with better products, education, equipment fitting and service.
 FootJoy’s trade partners in every region are provided with regular educational seminars in product features and benefits; inventory control methods; proper merchandising and display techniques; and even training in shoe and glove fitting. The seminars are supplemented by online training modules that extend the content to a much wider audience of floor sales associates in all accounts.
 Supplementing our core field sales partnerships are certain Internet‑based initiatives. In the U.S. in 2016, we launched an eCommerce website for FootJoy and the MyProV1.com online golf shop.

 Marketing
 Throughout our history, a commitment to marketing has helped further elevate our brands and strengthen our reputation for product performance and quality, with a particular focus on the perception of dedicated golfers. Our strategy begins with delivering equipment that is superior in performance and quality, validated by the pyramid of influence. It is best‑in‑class performance and quality products that earn and maintain dedicated golfers’ loyalty and trust. Our marketing strategy, developed and refined over many years, helps reinforce this loyalty and trust, driving connectivity with our brands.
 The key cornerstones to build and strengthen golfer connections with our brands are: pyramid of influence validation; merchandising; advertising; and education and fitting. We believe that a more educated golfer is more likely to be a Titleist and FootJoy golfer. Our efforts contribute to consistent, responsive and rapid sell‑through of Titleist equipment and FootJoy wear for our trade partners.
 Pyramid of Influence Validation
 Broad usage and acceptance by the game’s best players, including tour players, club professionals and competitive amateurs, is fundamental to our mission and purpose. We have a global leadership team dedicated to servicing and supporting these golfers throughout the pyramid of influence. At professional and amateur events, the leadership team provides technical fitting expertise, product support and service to effectively represent, exhibit, recommend and communicate our premium performance and quality story. Our associates are trained product experts, many of whom are product category‑specific, whose goal is to arm players with the equipment that will enable them to perform at their highest level.
 Communicating the strength and depth of Titleist’s and FootJoy’s pyramid of influence usage to the dedicated golfer is another essential part of our leadership strategy. Within our advertising, merchandising, websites and other digital media content, we share the equipment counts, specific products and specifications and the results of our players. Our products enjoy broad usage and acceptance throughout the pyramid of influence. Dedicated golfers are interested in what products most of the world’s best players trust.
 Merchandising
 Excellence in merchandising, the retail format in which our products are presented to the consumer, is another sell‑through competency. The role of merchandising varies by product category. We believe Titleist is the golf ball leader in its in‑shop merchandising, and that Titleist golf balls make the first impression, best impression and longest lasting impression in premium golf shops. We also believe that these premium golf shops are where our dedicated golfer target audience is most likely to shop for their golf equipment needs. We have placed over 20,000 golf ball displays globally in order to effectively merchandise Titleist and Pinnacle golf balls.
 Titleist golf clubs, wedges and putters also maintain a premium merchandising presence in golf shops. Given that our core strategy is focused on selling custom fit golf clubs and wedges, we utilize displays to promote the product offering and offer demo trial sets, in many cases not in an attempt to generate an immediate sale but rather with the ultimate goal of encouraging golfers to schedule a fitting session.
 We are committed to ensuring that Titleist golf gear is prominently merchandised. We continue to invest in both displays and training for each of the golf bag, headwear, glove, travel and head cover product categories.
 FootJoy devotes considerable resources to the appearance of its products and displays at point of sale. This includes an extensive offering of fixed and temporary product displays, brand and product signing and graphics and a wide variety of visual tools to create a “shop in shop” environment that conveys the brand’s market leadership image.
 Advertising
 We drive brand and product awareness with a communication strategy that targets dedicated golfers in all forms of media, including television, print, and a wide variety of digital and social media forums. Our advertising strategy is focused on communicating the launch of new products to generate awareness and highlight our product performance and 

 
  26

 
quality competitive advantage. Our advertising serves as another educational tool to convey the technology and innovation behind our products and the resulting performance benefits for golfers.
 We have developed strong relationships with our media partners in order to secure prominent and effective positioning. We use broader reach golf media vehicles for golf ball, golf shoe and golf glove advertising and a more targeted approach for golf clubs, wedges and putters and apparel.
 Titleist.com and FootJoy.com are vital parts of our communication strategy with rich product, technology and fitting content. Our sites also provide locators for golf shops, advanced fitting centers and certified custom club fitters. We develop a significant amount of digital educational content, featuring tour players, club professionals and our R&D associates, that is distributed to dedicated golfers via our social media platforms. Over the last several years we have cultivated a large and growing following on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as a result of this content. In 2016, Titleist launched the MyProV1.com online golf shop in the United States to develop a stronger link with dedicated Titleist brand fans with plans to expand into additional markets in the future. This microsite allows golfers to create and purchase their own unique, custom imprinted Pro V1 or Pro V1x golf balls with special play numbers, logos or personalization. We believe this tool will increase the likelihood of repurchase and loyalty to Titleist golf balls.
 Team Titleist is a growing online community of avid golfers and Titleist fans that has been instrumental in establishing the direct communication link between us and our most loyal customers. Members of Team Titleist are given exclusive access to interact with Titleist associates as well as other Team Titleist members both in person and online. Team Titleist also provides us the platform for directly communicating new product information, tour news, custom fitting education and referrals and event schedules.
 The FJ Community is an online group of avid golfers who share a passion for the game of golf and FootJoy golf wear. What began 10 years ago as a method of reaching golfers on a direct basis has evolved into an open community of 50,000 committed golfers who connect with the brand and one another. As engagement levels increase, members earn access to new product introductions and opportunities to participate in unique promotions and events.
 Education and Fitting
 One of our core strategies and competencies is golf ball and golf club education and fitting. We also have in place several golf shoe fitting initiatives aimed at educating golfers on the importance of proper shoe fitting. We are committed to educating our trade partners and dedicated golfers on our product performance and technology. Playing with properly fit equipment helps golfers shoot lower scores. When golfers play better, they want to play more. Golf Ball Education and Fitting
 We believe performance and quality differences between golf ball brands and models are game changing. In order for golfers to shoot their lowest scores, it is important that they find the best ball suited to their game, as it is the only piece of equipment that they will use on every shot. As the golf ball category leader and a global leader in golf ball fitting and education, we are committed to help golfers understand and appreciate the differentiating and defining characteristics of Titleist golf balls, as well as the differences between the various Titleist golf ball products.
 Titleist golf ball education and fitting is performance‑based and focuses on improving scores. Our methodology is green‑to‑tee with an emphasis not on shots hit off of the tee but rather on shots hit into the green as that is where the vast majority of shots per round are made. Prioritizing short game spin performance helps golfers hit more shots closer to the pin to enable them to convert more putts. Our education program also reinforces the importance of golf ball to golf ball consistency. Golfers trust that a Titleist golf ball will perform exactly the way they expect it to if they hit their shot properly.
 Our approach to golf ball education and fitting is holistic and includes broad communication messaging in Titleist golf ball advertising, in‑shop merchandising, website and other digital media, trade partner golf ball certification and in‑field golfer education. In‑field golfer education is conducted by dedicated mobile golf ball fitting teams or Titleist tech reps, supplemented by the Titleist sales team. For example, in 2016, we provided over 100,000 golf ball recommendations by connecting in person with golfers at golf courses and golf shops. Over 500,000 additional golfers viewed our ball fitting and education materials through Titleist digital channels.

 Custom Club Fitting and Trial
 We believe that fundamental to achieving maximum performance from any golf club is the need to custom fit the club to the player’s individual needs and preferences. Augmenting excellent design and construction with customized specifications and components such as lie angle, shaft type, length and flex, as well as grip type and size, provides the player with the ability to maximize the performance potential of the club.
 To this end, providing golfers with the ability to try and be expertly fit for their clubs is a core go‑to‑market strategy for Titleist clubs. Over the past 20 years we have developed and improved our comprehensive fitting system and we deploy that system through a global “Good, Better, Best” network of carefully selected, trained, outfitted and certified custom club fitters.
 The global Titleist club fitting network includes over 4,000 trade partners. Each is outfitted with a SureFit interchangeable matrix of clubs in popular shaft types, lengths and flexes, along with a broad selection of Vokey Design wedges, thus providing them with the necessary tools to conduct high level fittings. Combined with annual training and certification, these partners are skilled and equipped to custom fit dedicated golfers.
 For golfers who want a higher level fitting experience, we have also developed a global network of approximately 185 advanced fitting partners. These fitting specialists are outfitted with a larger matrix of fitting tools. They receive priority referrals when golfers conduct an online search for a Titleist fitting location or contact us directly for referrals. In addition to our global network of fitting partners, we also deploy a global associate team of approximately 220 Titleist fitting technicians who conduct advanced level fittings directly with golfers at fitting and trial events. Collectively, our global network of fitting partners conducted approximately 230,000 fittings, over 100,000 of which were at over 10,000 Titleist fitting events.
 Finally, at the peak of the Titleist fitting services network, is the Titleist Performance Institute in Oceanside, California. The mission of the Titleist Performance Institute is to be the world’s most comprehensive and advanced golf performance center. Built in 1997, this approximately 30 acre property comprises three fairways with tour quality greens and bunkers, a state of the art fitness facility and a 3‑dimensional motion capture studio. The facility serves as headquarters for our tour fitting efforts, conducted by a team of elite fitters, and is also our primary club developmental testing site. Golf consumers who want the ultimate, tour‑level custom fitting experience can visit the Titleist Performance Institute for a fee and by appointment only.
 Golf Shoe Fitting
 We believe that a properly fit golf shoe is the most important element to optimizing comfort and product durability. As a global leader in golf shoe fitting, we hold events and seminars in key markets throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Golfer education is handled by dedicated fitting specialists and members of the FootJoy sales team.
 While a shoe that fits a golfer’s foot is essential for comfort, we believe that finding a shoe that fits a golfer’s swing can lead to increased performance and we believe there is a correlation between individual swing biomechanics and golfer performance. We deployed the FootJoy Performance Fitting System in the first quarter of 2017. The FootJoy Performance Fitting System is designed to capture the center‑of‑pressure movement during a golfer’s swing and help recommend the proper shoe construction type that can deliver additional club head speed. The FootJoy Performance Fitting System aims to eliminate the need for visual, anecdotal evidence to determine whether or not a golfer would benefit from a shoe constructed with more flexibility versus more rigidity or structure and instead relies upon a scientific solution. It is expected to be available in every major golf market as a performance supplement to shoe fitting for size and width.
 Seasonality
 Weather conditions in most parts of the world, including our primary geographic markets, generally restrict golf from being played year‑round, with many of our on‑course customers closed during the cold weather months. In general, during the first quarter, we begin selling our products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell‑in generally continues into the second quarter. Our second‑quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of sell‑through, in particular the amount of higher value discretionary purchases made by customers, which drives the level 

 
  28

 
of reorders of the products sold during the first quarter. Our third‑quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business, and are generally lower than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Our fourth‑quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of our key markets, but can also be affected by key product launches, particularly golf clubs. This seasonality, and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as discussed above under “—Our Products—Product Launch Cycles,” as well as weather conditions. This seasonality affects sales in each of our reportable segments differently. In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of our sales and most of our profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year.
 Research and Product Development
 Innovating within a highly regulated environment presents unique challenges and opportunities that require a significant investment in people, facilities and financial resources. We have six R&D facilities and/or test centers supported by over 180 scientists, chemists, engineers and technicians in aggregate. We are committed to continuous improvement and each R&D team is tasked to develop technology that will deliver better quality and performance products in each generation.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we invested $48.8 million, $46.0 million and $44.2 million, respectively, in R&D.
 We have separate dedicated R&D teams for each product category.
 Titleist Golf Balls
 Titleist golf ball R&D has a disciplined product development process. The R&D team consists of over 70 scientists, chemists, engineers and technicians. Their role is to innovate in all areas of golf ball design, materials and constructions by incorporating new technologies to widen our performance and quality competitive advantage. A dedicated team also works specifically on new process technologies for our golf ball manufacturing operations. They work closely with raw material suppliers to create standards and specifications. They establish quality systems, protocols and analysis and support Titleist ball operations in new product implementation.
 The golf ball R&D team is responsible for:

 player research | data analytics 
 product and process research | product development and implementation
 aerodynamics | analytical and competitive research 
 testing | intellectual property 
 test equipment | central quality 

      Titleist has three golf ball dedicated research facilities in the greater New Bedford, Massachusetts area that design, test, implement and support new product development and implementation:

· | the Titleist golf ball R&D team is based in our Fairhaven, Massachusetts headquarters facility;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Titleist Engineering and Technology Center in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts houses our advanced engineering associates as well as precision golf ball cavity manufacturing; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Titleist Manchester Lane in Acushnet, Massachusetts is a state‑of‑the‑art testing facility for R&D to conduct extensive robot and player testing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, we conduct additional golf ball product testing at our Oceanside, California test facility. We have dedicated R&D associates who work closely throughout the pyramid of influence, from PGA Tour players all the way to amateur Team Titleist members, to gather feedback on product performance expectations, conduct prototype testing and validate new products prior to market launch. This is a continuous iterative and collaborative process that impacts next generation golf balls as well as long‑term research and product direction.

 Titleist Golf Clubs, Wedges and Putters
 Our golf club R&D team and processes are structured in a manner that aims to create products which are innovative in design and superior in performance. The performance and quality of our products are a direct result of the commitment to golf clubs, wedges and putters R&D. Significant investment in R&D has led to a team size which has more than doubled since 2007. The department’s technical disciplines include computer‑aided design engineers, industrial designers, product development engineers, research engineers, lab technicians and testing staff. We have 65 associates dedicated to clubs and wedges R&D.
 We have distinct teams working on the concept creation and development for drivers, fairways, hybrids, irons, wedges and putters. These products are initially tested and validated at our state‑of‑the‑art testing facility in Oceanside, California.
 Scotty Cameron works from the Putter Studio in San Marcos, California which allows him to maximize his creativity and develop designs which are rich in craftsmanship as well as performance. This structure is necessary given there are unique expertise and performance requirements for each of the product categories.
 The product category teams all work with the following support teams: advanced research, shaft development, industrial design, lab analysis and mechanical testing, player testing and an Asia‑based support team working with our key suppliers.
 FootJoy
 We have approximately 10 product designers and development engineers in the golf shoe team located in Brockton, Massachusetts, with an additional four product development specialists located in our Taichung, Taiwan office. We have four golf apparel designers located in Fairhaven, Massachusetts and an additional 11 product development specialists in Hong Kong, China and Korea.
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 We consider our patents and trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. We are dedicated to protecting the innovations created by our R&D teams by developing broad and deep patent and trademark portfolios across all product categories.
 As a result, we have strong patent positions across our product categories and innovation spaces that we operate in, and have become the leader in obtaining golf ball and golf club patents worldwide. In addition, we believe we have more combined golf shoe and golf glove utility patents than all competitors combined. We have over 1,250 active U.S. utility patents in golf balls, nearly 350 active U.S. utility patents in golf clubs, wedges and putters and 296 active patents (including ex‑U.S. and design patents) in golf shoes and gloves.

 The following charts show our percentage of golf ball and golf club patents obtained in the last five years compared to our peers.

 We own or license a large portfolio of trademarks, including for Titleist, Pro V1, Pro V1x, Pinnacle, AP1, AP2, Vokey Design, Scotty Cameron, FootJoy, FJ, DryJoys, StaSof and ProDry. We protect our trademarks by obtaining registrations where appropriate and opposing or cancelling material infringements. We also have rights in several common law marks.
 Competition
 There are unique aspects to the competitive dynamic in each of our product categories.
 The golf ball business is highly competitive. There are a number of well‑established and well‑financed competitors, including Callaway, SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands) and Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands).
 The golf club, wedge and putters markets in which we compete are also highly competitive and are served by a number of well‑established and well‑financed companies with recognized brand names, including Callaway, TaylorMade and Ping.
 For golf balls and golf clubs, wedges and putters, we generally compete on the basis of technology, quality, performance and customer service.
 In the golf gear market, there are numerous competitors in each product category and geographical market. Titleist golf gear generally competes on the basis of quality, performance, styling and customer service.
 FootJoy’s significant worldwide competitors in golf shoes include Nike, Adidas and Ecco. FootJoy’s primary worldwide competitors in golf gloves include Callaway, Nike and TaylorMade/Adidas and a significant number of smaller companies with regional offerings and specialized golf glove products. In the golf apparel category, FootJoy has numerous competitors in each geographical market, including Nike, Adidas and Under Armour. FootJoy products generally compete on the basis of quality, performance, styling and price.
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, 

 
  31

 
release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants. In the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes, we use paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generate waste by‑products that are subject to these environmental laws.
 We estimate incurring future costs for past and current environmental issues relating to ongoing closure activities at the following sites: (i) our former Titleist Ball Plant 1 in Acushnet, Massachusetts, which is subject to ongoing remediation of past contamination under the oversight of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection; (ii) our Ball Plant C in New Bedford, Massachusetts, which is subject to an ongoing investigation related to contamination that is evidently migrating from an adjacent third‑party facility; and (iii) investigations and cleanups at four third‑party disposal facilities. We do not expect that any of the future anticipated expenditures at these sites will have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We have also incurred expenses in connection with environmental compliance. Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect upon our business. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws.
 Regulation
 The Rules of Golf
 The Rules of Golf set forth the rules of play and the rules for equipment used in the game of golf. The first documented rules of golf date to 1744 and the modern Rules of Golf have been in place for over 100 years. Dedicated golfers respect the traditions of the game and play by the Rules of Golf. As a result, premium‑positioned products are designed and manufactured to conform to the Rules of Golf.
 The United States Golf Association, or the USGA, is the governing body for golf in the United States and Mexico. The USGA, in conjunction with the Royal and Ancient, or R&A, in St. Andrews, Scotland, writes, interprets and maintains the Rules of Golf. The R&A is the governing body for golf in all jurisdictions outside of the United States and Mexico. The R&A jointly writes, interprets and maintains the Rules of Golf with the USGA.
 In addition to their role as rule makers, both the USGA and R&A conduct national championships and are involved in other efforts to maintain the history of golf and promote the health of the game.
 The Rules of Golf set the standards and establish limitations for the design and performance of all balls and clubs. Many new regulations on golf balls and golf clubs have been introduced in the past 10 to 15 years, which we believe was one of the most active periods for golf equipment regulation in the history of golf.
 Golf Balls
 Historically, the USGA and R&A have regulated the size, weight, spherical symmetry, initial velocity and overall distance performance of golf balls. The overall distance standard was then revised in 2004. Golf Clubs
 The USGA and R&A have also focused on golf club regulations. In 1998, a limitation was placed on the spring‑like effect of driver faces. In 2003, limits were placed on club head dimensions and volume, as well as shaft length. In 2007, club head moment of inertia was limited. A rule change to allow greater adjustability in golf clubs went into effect January 1, 2008. In August 2008, the USGA and R&A adopted a rule change further restricting golf club grooves by reducing the groove volume and limiting the groove edge angle allowable on irons and wedges. This rule change will not apply to most golfers until January 1, 2024. It was implemented on professional tours beginning in 2010 and was implemented in elite amateur competitions beginning in 2014. All products manufactured after December 31, 2010 must comply with the new groove specifications. Our Position
 In response to this regulatory dynamic, our senior management and R&D teams spend significant time and effort in developing and maintaining relationships with the USGA and R&A. We are an active participant in discussions 

 
  32

 
with the ruling bodies regarding potential new rules and the rule making process. More importantly, our R&D teams are driven to innovate and continuously improve product technology and performance within the Rules of Golf. The development and protection of these innovations through aggressive patenting are essential to competing in the current market. As a long‑time industry participant and market leader, we are well‑positioned to continue to outperform the market in a rules constrained environment.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed 5,208 associates worldwide (5,171 full time and 37 part time). The geographic concentration of associates is as follows: 2,453 in the Americas, 438 in EMEA, and 2,317 employed in Asia Pacific. Associates with over ten years of employment with us account for approximately 50% of our total associate count in the United States. The employment of all associates is at will and none of our associates are represented by a union. We believe that relations with our associates are positive.
