ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Information
 
 Franklin Covey is a global company focused on organizational performance improvement.  Our mission is to "enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere," and our global structure is designed to help individuals and organizations achieve sustained superior performance through changes in human behavior.  From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity and time management, we have developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve lasting behavioral change in seven crucial areas: Leadership, Execution, Productivity, Trust, Sales Performance, Customer Loyalty, and Educational Improvement.  We believe that our clients are able to utilize our content and offerings to create cultures whose hallmarks are high-performing, collaborative individuals, led by effective, trust building leaders who execute with excellence and deliver measurably improved results for all of their key stakeholders.
 
The Company was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the state of Utah, and we merged with the Covey Leadership Center in 1997 to form Franklin Covey Co.  Our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 totaled $185.3 million and our shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "FC."
 
Our fiscal year ends on August 31 of each year.  Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years apply to the 12 months ended August 31 of the specified year.
 
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331, and our telephone number is (801) 817‑1776.

 Recent Business Developments
 During fiscal 2016, we introduced the All Access Pass (AAP), which allows our clients unlimited access to our content through an electronic portal.  We believe the All Access Pass is a revolutionary and innovative way to deliver content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations.  Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs.  During fiscal 2017, we invested significant capital to further develop the AAP offering and increase its usefulness to our clients.  We are currently translating AAP materials into 15 additional languages and completing significant upgrades of the AAP portal.  These enhancements to the AAP are expected to be launched in fiscal 2018.
  
While we anticipated that the introduction of the AAP would be disruptive to our current business, especially during the transition to this new business model, we believe that the AAP will provide long-term benefits to our clients and to our financial results.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we decided to allow new AAP agreements to receive updated content throughout the contracted period.  As a result of this decision, we are required to defer substantially all AAP revenue at the inception of the agreement and recognize the revenue over the life of the corresponding contract.  This decision had a significant impact on our fiscal 2017 financial statements, especially reported revenue, as we deferred significant AAP contract revenues.  However, we anticipate that the recognition of deferred AAP sales will benefit future periods and reduce seasonal revenue fluctuations.
 
In addition to the continued development of the All Access Pass, we made a number of changes to our business in fiscal 2017, including the following:
 
 
· | New China Offices –On September 1, 2016 we opened three new sales offices in China. These offices are located in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Subsequent to August 31, 2017, we opened another sales office in Shenzhen, China. Our sales operations in China were previously managed by an independent licensee partner. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquisition of Robert Gregory Partners – In May 2017, we acquired the assets of Robert Gregory Partners, LLC (RGP), a corporate coaching firm with expertise in executive coaching, transition acceleration coaching, leadership development coaching, implementation coaching, and consulting. We anticipate that RGP services and methodologies will become key offerings in our training and consulting business. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquisition of Jhana Education – In July 2017, we acquired the stock of Jhana Education (Jhana), a company that specializes in the creation and dissemination of relevant, bite-sized content and learning tools for leaders and managers. We anticipate that the Jhana content and delivery methodologies acquired will become key features of our AAP offering. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | License Rights for Intellectual Property – During fiscal 2017, we acquired the license rights for certain intellectual property owned by Higher Moment, LLC. The intellectual property is in part based on works authored and developed by Dr. Clayton Christensen, a well-known author and lecturer, who is a member of our Board of Directors. As we seek to expand offerings available on the AAP, we anticipate additional purchases or licenses of intellectual property in future periods.

 Services Overview
 
We operate globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service.  To achieve this level of service we have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.  In foreign

locations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in over 150 other countries and territories around the world.
 
Our mission is to "enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere," and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior.  We seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest distribution capabilities through the most flexible content delivery modalities.  We believe these characteristics distinguish us from our competitors as follows:
 
 
1. | World Class Content – Rather than rely on "flavor of the month" training fads, our content is principle-centered and based on natural laws of human behavior and effectiveness. Our content is designed to build new skillsets, establish new mindsets, and provide enabling toolsets. When our content is applied consistently in an organization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to achieve its own great purposes. Our content is well researched, subjected to numerous field beta tests, and improved through a proven development process. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Breadth and Scalability of Delivery Options – We have a wide range of content delivery options, including: the All Access Pass and other intellectual property licensing arrangements, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, on-line learning, blended learning, and organization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Global Capability – We not only operate domestically with sales personnel in the United States and Canada, but we also deliver content through our directly owned international offices and international licensee partners who deliver our content in over 150 other countries and territories around the world. This capability allows us to deliver content to a wide range of customers, from large, multinational corporations to smaller, local entities. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We hold ourselves responsible for and measure ourselves by our clients' achievement of transformational results.
 
Our content and offerings are designed to help our clients achieve their own great purposes through a variety of resources, including best-selling books and audio, innovative and widely recognized thought leadership, and multiple delivery and teaching methods.  These elements allow us to offer our clients training and consulting solutions that are designed to improve individual and organizational behaviors, deliver content that adapts to an organization's unique needs, and provide meaningful improvements in our clients' business performance.  Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com.  However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.
 
Segment Information
 
 Our sales are primarily comprised of training and content sales and related products.  During fiscal 2017, we managed our business in four segments, which are primarily focused on targeted client markets.  These segments were as follows in fiscal 2017:

· | Direct Offices – This segment consists of our sales force that serves the United States and Canada; our international sales offices located in Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and Australia; and our public programs group.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strategic Markets – This segment includes our government services office, the Sales Performance practice, the Customer Loyalty practice, and the "Global 50" group, which is specifically focused on sales to large, multi-national organizations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Education practice – This segment is comprised of our domestic and international Education practice operations, which are centered on sales to educational institutions such as elementary schools, high schools, and colleges and universities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | International Licensees – This segment is primarily comprised of our international licensees' royalty revenues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
For financial and other information regarding our operating segments, refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements (Note 17).  For risks inherent in our foreign operations, refer to the risk factors identified in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 
As we continue to transition to an AAP-focused business model, subsequent to August 31, 2017, we merged the Strategic Markets segment into the Direct Offices segment since our primary sales focus will be All Access Pass clients, Education clients, and our international licensee partners.


Industry Information
 
According to the Training magazine 2017 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is estimated to be $93.7 billion, which is a significant increase (32%) compared with the prior year.  One of our competitive advantages in this highly fragmented industry stems from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, measurement methodologies, and implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.  This advantage allows us to deliver not only training to both corporations and individuals, but also to implement the training through the use of powerful behavior-changing tools with the capability to then measure the impact of the delivered content and solutions.
Clients
 
We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and individual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned operations.  We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world, which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty.  We are not dependent on a single client or industry group, and during the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues.
 
Over our history, we have provided content, services, and products to 97 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 75 percent of the Fortune 500 companies.  We also provide content and services to a number of U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, as well as numerous educational institutions.  Due to the nature of our business, we do not have a significant backlog of orders.  Nearly all of our deferred revenue is attributable to subscription services for which we recognize revenue over the lives of the corresponding agreements.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services comparable with those that we offer.  The nature of the competition in the performance improvement industry, however, is highly fragmented with few large competitors.  Based upon our fiscal 2017 consolidated sales of $185.3 million, we believe that we are a leading competitor in the performance skills and education market.  Other significant comparative companies in the performance improvement market are Development Dimensions International, CRA International, Inc., Learning Tree International Inc., GP Strategies Corp., FTI Consulting, Inc., American Management Association, Wilson Learning, Forum Corporation, The Hackett Group, and the Center for Creative Leadership.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:
 
 
· | Quality of offerings, services, and solutions
--+----------------------------------------------

· | Skills and capabilities of people
--+----------------------------------


· | Innovative training and consulting services combined with effective products
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to add value to client operations
--+------------------------------------------


· | Reputation and client references
--+---------------------------------


· | Price
--+------


· | Availability of appropriate resources
--+--------------------------------------


· | Global reach and scale
--+-----------------------


· | Branding and name recognition in our marketplace
--+-------------------------------------------------



Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices.  However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry.  We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content, as indicated by our strong gross margins, branded content, and best-selling books; (2) the breadth of delivery options we are able to offer to customers for utilizing our content, including the All Access Pass, live presentations by our own training consultants, live presentations though Company certified client-employed facilitators, intellectual property licensing, web-based presentations, and film-based presentations; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe, through our mix of direct offices and our global licensee network; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients' results.  Moreover, we believe that we are a market leader in the U.S. in leadership, execution, productivity, and individual effectiveness content.
 
Seasonality
 
Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education practice (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter resulting from year-end incentive programs.  Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.
 
We believe that the recognition of deferred revenue from All Access Pass sales over the lives of the underlying arrangements will reduce some of the seasonality in our financial statements as described above.  However, the underlying sales activity as described above will continue to produce some measure of seasonality in our financial statements in future periods.
 
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We do not manufacture any of our products.  We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for these products are readily available.  We currently believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and contractors.  Our materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.
Trademarks, Copyrights, and Intellectual Property
 
Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights.  We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements.  We claim rights for over 580 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits.  We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business.
 
We claim over 200 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media

products, including audio and video media.  We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein.  We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials.  In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees.
 
Employees
 
One of our most important assets is our people.  The diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to serve a variety of clients on a worldwide basis.  We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining quality personnel and actively strive to reinforce our employees' commitment to our clients, and to our mission, vision, culture, and values through the creation of a motivational and rewarding work environment.
 
We currently have approximately 850 associates.  None of our associates are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.  Management believes that its relations with its associates are good and we do not currently foresee a shortage in qualified personnel needed to operate and grow our business.
