Item 1. Business
Business Overview
TravelCenters of America Inc. is a Maryland corporation. Prior to August 1, 2019, we were organized as a Delaware limited liability company. For further discussion of the general development of our business, please see Item 1. "Business" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we operated or franchised 316 travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and standalone restaurants. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants and franchisees.
As of December 31, 2020, our business included 271 travel centers in 44 states in the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada, primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, operated primarily under the "TravelCenters of America," "TA," "TA Express," "Petro Stopping Centers" and "Petro" brand names. Of these travel centers, we owned 51, we leased 181, we operated two for a joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest and 37 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We operated 232 of our travel centers and franchisees operated 39 travel centers, including two we leased to franchisees. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as a wide range of truck repair and maintenance services, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, FSRs, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and various customer amenities.
As of December 31, 2020, our business included three standalone truck service facilities operated under the "TA Truck Service" brand name. Of these standalone truck service facilities, we leased two and owned one. Our standalone truck service facilities offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and roadside services to large trucks.
As of December 31, 2020, our business included 42 standalone restaurants in 12 states in the United States operated primarily under the "Quaker Steak & Lube," or QSL, brand name. Of these standalone restaurants, we operated 14 restaurants (four we owned, eight we leased, one we operated for one of our franchisees and one we operated for a joint venture in which we owned a noncontrolling interest) and 28 were owned or leased from others and operated by our franchisees. We have entered into an agreement to sell our QSL business, which includes 41 of our standalone restaurants, for approximately $5.0 million, excluding costs to sell and certain closing adjustments. This sale is expected to close during the 2021 first quarter; however, it is subject to certain conditions. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will complete this sale, that this sale will not be delayed or that the terms will not change. For more information about the sale of our QSL business, please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report.
We manage our business as one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning fuel and nonfuel products and services because they facilitate our discussion of trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. We have a single travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, that we do not consider material to our operations.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 13,150 people on a full time basis and 4,700 people on a part time basis at our travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and standalone restaurants and we employed an additional 874 people in field management, corporate and other roles to support our locations. Approximately 47 of our employees at two travel centers are represented by unions. For more information regarding our employees, please refer to "Human Capital Resources" below.
Recent Significant Events
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, and, in response to the outbreak, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency in the United States and many states and municipalities declared public health emergencies. Various governmental responses attempting to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and continue to negatively impact, the global economy, including the U.S. economy. 
In varying degrees, states and municipalities across the United States have generally allowed businesses to reopen and have generally eased restrictions they had previously implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, often in stages that are phased in over time. Recently, some states and municipalities have re-imposed certain restrictions in response to increases in COVID-19 infections. Economic data has indicated that the U.S. economy has improved since its lowest periods in March and April 2020, although the U.S. gross domestic product remains below pre-pandemic levels. It is unclear whether the increases in the number of COVID-19 infections will continue to escalate and, if so, what the impact of that would be on human health and safety, the economy and our business.
Our business is focused on travel centers and related trucking and driver services, products and amenities. Our business benefited from increased demand for e-commerce and from being recognized by various governmental authorities as a provider of services to essential businesses which allowed us to continue operating most aspects of our travel centers, except for many of our FSRs and casinos, through the pandemic. Further, we also benefited from increased initial demand by businesses and households to stock up on certain products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increased trucking activity to transport those goods across the United States.
We have taken several actions in an attempt to address the operating and financial impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
•we significantly reduced our planned capital expenditures for 2020 to conserve cash and liquidity;
•we temporarily closed most of our FSRs, more than half of which had reopened as of December 31, 2020. However, as a result of the recent increase in COVID-19 infections in several states, we have closed or plan to re-close certain of our restaurants;
•we have rationalized our hours of operation and employment levels, including furloughing approximately 4,300 field employees, and approximately 120 corporate employees. Many of these employees returned to work between May and December 2020 as we began to reopen some of our FSRs, though some employees may again be subject to furlough if certain of our restaurants are re-closed; 
•we have implemented enhanced sanitizing and cleaning procedures at our travel centers in accordance with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, guidance; and
•we have been actively engaging with government authorities, our industry association, customers, suppliers and other vendors to try to best execute our business during the pandemic.
We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including:
•our trucking customers and their ability to withstand the current economic conditions;
•our operations, liquidity and capital needs and resources; 
•conducting financial modeling and sensitivity analyses;
•actively communicating with our customers, vendors and other key constituents and stakeholders in order to help assess market conditions, opportunities, best practices and mitigate risks and potential adverse impacts; and
•monitoring, with the assistance of counsel and other specialists, possible government relief funding sources and other programs that may be available to us, our franchisees or our tenants to enable us and them to operate through the current economic conditions and enhance our franchisees' ability to pay us royalties and our tenants' ability to pay us rent.
We believe that our current financial resources and our expectations as to the future performance of the trucking industry and our operations will enable us to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. As of February 25, 2021, we had:
•approximately $491.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, which included $80.0 million of net proceeds raised through an underwritten public equity offering of our common stock completed in July 2020 and $190.1 million of net proceeds from our new $200.0 million term loan facility, or our Term Loan Facility, completed in December 2020;
•approximately $70.0 million of availability under our Credit Facility;
•no debt maturities until 2024 when our Credit Facility is scheduled to expire; and
•our ability to request that SVC purchase from us qualified capital improvements we make to the travel centers we lease from SVC in return for increased rent, although SVC is not obligated to agree to make those purchases.
We have taken various measures to protect the health and safety of our customers, employees and other persons who visit our travel centers and restaurants. These measures include, among others: 
•we have supplied masks and gloves to all of our employees;
•we are mandating that masks be worn at all of our sites and at our corporate headquarters;
•we have temporarily closed all self service food stations in the travel stores in most of our travel centers;
•we have increased the frequency of our routine cleaning and sanitizing schedule, as well as implemented enhanced sanitizing and cleaning procedures at our travel centers and at the fuel pumps and pin pads; 
•we are following state and local health department regulations at all of our sites;
•we are encouraging customers and employees to follow CDC recommendations of practicing social distancing;
•we have advised our employees to take care of themselves and to be aware of best practices for preventive safety measures, including frequent hand washing, wearing masks, practicing social distancing when possible and staying home when feeling ill; and
•we temporarily closed all gyms and lounge areas within our travel centers, some of which we began to reopen in September 2020.
There are extensive uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. These uncertainties include, among others: 
•the duration and severity of the current economic downturn;
•the strength and sustainability of any economic recovery;
•the timing and process for how the government and other market participants may continue to oversee and conduct the return of economic activity when the COVID-19 pandemic abates, such as what continuing restrictions and protective measures may remain in place or be added and what restrictions and protective measures may be lifted or reduced in order to foster a return of increased economic activity in the United States; and
•the responses of governments, businesses and the general public to any increased levels of rates of COVID-19 infections.
We have also implemented enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing guidelines at our corporate headquarters, as well as business continuity plans to help our employees remain healthy and able to support us remotely, including providing appropriate information technology such as notebook computers, smart phones, computer applications, information technology security applications and technology support.
As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to determine what the ultimate impact will be on our and our customers', vendors' and other stakeholders' businesses, operations, financial results and financial position. For further information on the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business and risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath on us and our business, please refer to Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
Lease Amendments and Travel Center Purchases
In January 2019, we acquired from SVC 20 travel centers we previously leased from SVC for $309.6 million, including $1.4 million of transaction related costs, and amended our existing leases with SVC such that:
•the 20 purchased travel centers were removed from the applicable leases and our annual minimum rent was reduced by $43.1 million;
•the term of each lease was extended by three years;
•the amount of deferred rent obligation to be paid to SVC was reduced from $150.0 million to $70.5 million, payable in 16 equal quarterly installments, which commenced on April 1, 2019; and
•commencing with the year ended December 31, 2020, we began to pay to SVC an additional amount of percentage rent equal to one-half percent (0.5%) of the excess of the annual nonfuel revenues at leased sites over the nonfuel revenues for each respective site for the year ending December 31, 2019.
The lease amendments are further described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report.
Reorganization Plan
On April 30, 2020, we committed to and initiated the Reorganization Plan to improve the efficiency of our operations. As part of the Reorganization Plan, we reduced our headcount and eliminated certain positions, which we expect to result in approximately $13.1 million of net annual savings in selling, general and administrative expense. In addition, we made certain changes in our leadership and their roles and created both a corporate development team and a procurement team. The non-recurring costs of the Reorganization Plan were $4.3 million, which were comprised primarily of severance, outplacement services, stock based compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of previously granted stock awards for certain employees and fees for recruitment of certain executive positions. These costs were recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report for more information about the Reorganization Plan.
Transformation Plan
During the 2020 second quarter, we commenced a strategic transformation consisting of numerous initiatives across our organization, including the Reorganization Plan, to enhance operations, strengthen our financial position, reduce costs and expand our nationwide network by increasing our franchising business, or the Transformation Plan. These initiatives included significant leadership appointments of qualified candidates who bring new and valuable experiences as well as initiative, critical skills and new visions and approaches to our business. Key among these initiatives was the creation of a centralized procurement group to drive economies of scale in pricing, increased leverage in vendor negotiations and ultimately lead to substantial purchasing savings and a streamlined operation. Other key initiatives are focused in areas of liquidity, identifying opportunities for realizing both costs savings and increased revenues, including merchandising in the convenience stores, internal distribution of merchandise delivery, truck repair training and staffing and information technology, or IT, systems.
Recent Financing Activities
On July 6, 2020, we received net proceeds of $80.0 million, after $0.3 million offering costs and $5.1 million underwriting discounts and commissions, from the sale and issuance of 6.1 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public equity offering. On December 14, 2020, we entered into a $200.0 million Term Loan Facility that is secured by a pledge of all the equity interests of substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries and a pledge of substantially all of our other assets and the assets of such wholly owned subsidiaries. We expect to use the net proceeds from our equity offering and the Term Loan Facility to fund deferred maintenance and other capital expenditures necessary to enhance property conditions and implement updates to key IT infrastructure, growth initiatives consistent with our Transformation Plan and general business purposes. Please refer to Note 7 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report for more information about our Term Loan Facility and underwritten public equity offering, respectively.
Growth and Cost Control Strategies
We have commenced numerous initiatives across our organization under our Transformation Plan for the purpose of expanding our travel center network, improving and enhancing operational efficiencies and profitability and in support of our core mission to "Return every traveler to the road better than they came." We believe these and certain other initiatives will expand our franchise base, increase diesel fuel and gasoline gross margin and fuel sales volume, increase market share in the truck service industry, improve merchandising and gross margin in store and retail services and improve operating effectiveness in our food service offerings while focusing on opportunities to continue to control costs in field operations.
Our growth strategies are focused on both extending our travel center network and on expanding our scope of products and services as well as the customer segments we serve in a way that enhances and compliments our travel center product and service offerings. Our strategies exclude investing in assets and businesses that are beyond or unrelated to our current asset base and product offerings.
We intend to extend our travel center network by adding travel centers to our network through franchising, new build development and acquisitions. 
We also intend to expand our scope of products and services and our customer segments through investments of capital and human resources in our truck service business, particularly our Road Squad®, TechOn-Site® and Commercial Tire Network™ programs. Each of these programs, as further described below under the heading "Operations – TA Truck Service," can service our traditional long haul trucking customers as well as other truck owner customers we historically have not served.
Our recent franchising, development and acquisition activities are summarized as follows:
Travel Centers. Since the beginning of 2019, we entered into franchise agreements covering 33 travel centers to be operated under our travel center brand names, including 21 new agreements in 2020. Four of these franchised travel centers began operations during 2019, 10 began operations during 2020, one began operations thus far in 2021 and we anticipate the remaining 18 franchised travel centers will begin operations by the end of the 2022 first quarter.
Typical improvements we make at recently added travel centers include adding truck repair facilities and nationally branded QSRs, paving parking lots, rebranding gasoline offerings, replacing outdated fuel dispensers, installing DEF dispensing systems, adding biodiesel blending, changing signage, installing point of sale and other IT systems and general building and cosmetic upgrades. The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers' supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. We estimate that the travel centers we acquire generally will reach financial stabilization approximately three years after completion of improvements, but actual results can vary widely from this estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and we cannot be certain that acquired locations will operate profitably.
On October 28, 2019, we entered into a multi unit franchise agreement with IHOP in which we agreed to rebrand and convert up to 94 of our FSRs to IHOP restaurants over five years, or the IHOP Agreement. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we and IHOP agreed to delay the rebranding schedule by one year. Of the 94, we are obligated to convert the initial 20 FSRs to IHOP restaurants, with the remaining conversions at our discretion. We opened one location in January 2020 and are currently proceeding with the conversion of five additional locations. We currently operate these FSRs under our Iron Skillet or Country Pride brand names. The average investment per site to rebrand these restaurants is expected to be approximately $1.4 million. In addition, we are carefully evaluating other opportunities to drive value within our full service restaurants.
Other Acquisitions. During the two years ended December 31, 2020, we acquired one parcel of land on which we or one of our franchisees plans to develop a TA Express branded travel center and opened one standalone truck service facility for a total investment of $1.8 million, including costs of renovations and equipment.
Please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions during 2020 and 2019.
Our Travel Centers
Our typical TA or Petro branded travel center includes:
•over 24 acres of land with parking for approximately 200 tractor trailers and 100 cars;
•a FSR and one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•a truck repair facility and parts shop;
•multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points, including DEF dispensers at the diesel lanes; and
•a travel store, game room, lounge and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Our typical TA Express branded travel center includes:
•approximately 10 acres of land with parking for approximately 60 tractor trailers and 50 cars;
•one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•multiple diesel, gasoline and DEF fueling points; and
•a travel store and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Substantially all of our travel centers are full service sites located on or near an interstate highway exit and offer fuel and nonfuel products and services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
Our travel center locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:
•Fuel. We sell unbranded diesel fuel at separate truck fueling lanes and we sell gasoline and diesel fuel at motorist fuel islands. As of December 31, 2020, we offered branded gasoline at approximately 259 of our locations and unbranded gasoline at eight of our travel centers operated by our franchisees and two of our travel centers operated by us.
•Diesel Exhaust Fluid. DEF is an additive that is required by most truck engines manufactured after 2010. As of December 31, 2020, we offered DEF from dispensers on the diesel fueling island at approximately 263 of our travel centers and plan to have DEF dispensers available in all lanes at our travel centers by the end of 2021.
•Full Service Restaurants and Quick Service Restaurants. Most of our TA and Petro branded travel centers have both FSRs and QSRs, and our TA Express branded travel centers have one or more QSRs that offer customers a wide variety of nationally recognized branded food choices. The substantial majority of our FSRs within our travel centers are operated under our Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brands and offer menu table service. At certain travel centers we have converted the FSR to a franchised brand, such as IHOP®, Black Bear Diner®, Fuddruckers® and Bob Evans®. We are in the process of considering rebranding up to 94 of our FSRs currently operated under the Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brand names to IHOP®. We also operate approximately 51 different brands of QSRs, including Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits®, Subway®, Burger King®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut®, Dunkin' Donuts® and Starbuck's Coffee®. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 193 of our travel centers included a FSR, approximately 180 of our travel centers offered at least one QSR and there were a total of approximately 467 QSRs in our 271 travel centers.
•Truck Service. Most of our travel centers have truck repair and maintenance facilities. Our 246 truck repair and maintenance facilities typically have between two and eight service bays and are staffed by service technicians employed by us or our franchisees. These shops generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and road services, ranging from basic services such as oil changes, wheel alignments and tire repair to specialty services such as diagnostics and repair of air conditioning, brakes and electrical systems and diesel filter cleaning. Our repair and maintenance services are generally covered by our warranty. Most of our truck repair and maintenance facilities provide some warranty work on Daimler Trucks North America, or Daimler, brand trucks through our participation in the Freightliner ServicePoint® and Western Star ServicePoint® programs, as described under the heading "Operations – Daimler Agreement" below. In addition to work we perform at our facilities, we also provide roadside emergency truck repair, call center and off site truck repair and maintenance services, as described under the heading "Operations – TA Truck Service" below.
•Travel Stores. Travel stores located at our travel centers typically have a selection of over 5,500 items, including packaged food and snack items, beverages, non-prescription drug and beauty supplies, batteries, automobile accessories, and music and video products. Each travel store also has a "to go" bar offering fresh brewed coffee, hot dogs, prepared sandwiches and other prepared foods. The travel stores in our travel centers also sell items specifically designed for the truck driver's "on the road" lifestyle, including laundry supplies, clothing, truck accessories and a variety of electronics.
•Parking. Many of our travel centers offer the Reserve-It!® parking program, which allows drivers to reserve for a fee a parking space in advance of arriving at a travel center. As of December 31, 2020, we offered the Reserve-It!® parking program at 228 of our travel centers and we had dedicated a total of approximately 6,500 parking spaces for this program. These reserved parking spaces comprise an average percentage of the total parking spaces per site of approximately 15.9%.
•Additional Driver Services. We believe that trucking fleets can improve the retention and recruitment of truck drivers by directing them to visit large, high quality, full service travel centers with plentiful overnight parking such as ours. We offer commercial trucker and other customer loyalty programs, the principal program being the UltraOne® Program, that are similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Under our loyalty programs, drivers receive points for diesel fuel purchases and for selected nonfuel products and services. These points may be redeemed for discounts on nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In addition, we publish a magazine called RoadKing® which includes articles and advertising of interest to professional truck drivers. Some of our travel centers offer casino gaming. We strive to provide a consistently high level of service and amenities to professional truck drivers at all of our travel centers, which we believe make our travel centers an attractive choice for trucking fleets. Most of our travel centers provide truck drivers the amenities including:
•specialized business services, including an information center where drivers can send and receive faxes, overnight mail and other communications;
•a banking desk where drivers can cash checks and receive funds transfers from fleet operators;
•wi-fi internet access;
•a laundry area with washers and dryers;
•private showers;
•free exercise facilities; and
•areas designated for truck drivers only, including a theater or big screen television room with a video player and comfortable seating.
Operations
Fuel. We sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. For the year ended December 31, 2020, diesel fuel and gasoline revenues represented approximately 86.3% and 13.7%, respectively, of our total fuel revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 89.5% of our diesel fuel sales volume was sold at discounts to posted prices under pricing arrangements with fleet customers. We have numerous sources for our diesel fuel and gasoline supply, including nearly all of the large oil companies operating in the United States. We purchase diesel fuel from various suppliers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily. By establishing diesel fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various diesel fuel suppliers. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple diesel fuel suppliers may help us avoid product outages during times of diesel fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are few suppliers for diesel fuel in that market and we may have only one viable supplier. Generally we have single sources of supply for gasoline at each of our locations. We offer biodiesel at a number of our travel centers and have a limited number of suppliers for this product at those sites.
A large majority of truck drivers use a payment method known as truck "fuel cards" that allow truck drivers to purchase fuel and other products and services, and permits trucking companies to track fuel and other purchases made by their drivers throughout the United States. Most of our trucking customers transact business with us by use of these fuel cards, most of which are issued by third party fuel card companies. Currently, the fuel card industry has only two significant participants, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., the parent of Comdata Inc., or Comdata, and its subsidiaries, or FleetCor, and WEX Inc., and its subsidiaries, or WEX. Also, we have a joint venture with Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores, Inc., or Love's, in which we both own a 50.0% interest in QuikQ LLC, or QuikQ, an independent full-service fuel payment solutions provider, which is currently used by a limited number of our trucking customers. We believe almost all trucking companies use only a single fuel card provider and have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective sole fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing.
Generally, our fuel purchases are delivered directly from suppliers' terminals to our locations and we do not contract to purchase substantial quantities of fuel to hold as inventory; however, we may do so in the future. We generally have only a few days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our travel centers. We believe our exposure to market price increases for diesel fuel and gasoline is partially mitigated by the significant amount of our diesel fuel and gasoline sales that are sold under arrangements that include pricing formulae that reset daily and are indexed to market prices and by us generally not purchasing fuel for delivery other than on the date of purchase. We historically have not engaged in any fixed or hedged price fuel contracts.
Non-Fossil Fuel and Alternative Energy. In anticipation of the possible changes that may eventually affect our industry regarding fuel and energy use, we are evaluating our long term strategies to position ourselves to efficiently and successfully adapt to these changes. These industry changes may include increasing adoption of the use of non-fossil fuel and alternative energy. Among these changes may be the use of electric vehicle technologies, which have been led initially by the automotive and light duty truck industries and more recently followed by leaders in commercial trucking, as well as hydrogen fuel, natural gas and other possible sources. While we believe that we are in the preliminary stages of evaluating these changes, we believe that a defined strategy, with dedicated internal resources, is important as we position ourselves to successfully incorporate these changes into our business. While we are currently increasing our biodiesel blending capabilities, as well as expanding our ability to offer DEF at the pump, we are also preparing for the future. This preparation may include dedicated internal leadership, the possibility of the creation of joint ventures and partnerships, as well as the potential for direct capital investments in infrastructure. One current example is that we are preparing to offer hydrogen fuel for sale at one of our sites, and we continue to actively explore other opportunities regarding alternative fuels and energy.
Nonfuel Products. We have many sources for the large variety of nonfuel products that we sell. We have developed supply relationships with several suppliers of certain nonfuel products, including Daimler for truck parts, Bridgestone Corporation, Continental AG, Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Michelin North America, Inc. and Yokohama Tire Corporation for truck tires, Core-Mark Holding Company Inc. for tobacco and other travel stores products, U.S. Foods for restaurant food products and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation, Equilon Enterprises LLC doing business as Shell Oil Products U.S., or Shell, and Chevron Corporation for lubricants. We maintain two distribution centers to distribute certain nonfuel products to our locations using a combination of contract carriers and our fleet of trucks and trailers. We believe these distribution centers allow us to purchase, maintain and transport inventory and supplies at lower costs.
TA Truck Service. In addition to the truck repair and maintenance services provided at our travel centers, we also provide customers a wide variety of "off site" repair and maintenance services, as described below.
•Road Squad® is a roadside truck service program that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. As of December 31, 2020, this program included a fleet of approximately 627 heavy duty professionally maintained emergency vehicles equipped with GPS technology at our travel centers and other sites and third party roadside service providers in 50 U.S. states and 12 Canadian provinces with a total of approximately 2,550 locations. We centrally dispatch our service trucks and third party service providers from our call center to assist customers with comprehensive repair services when they are unable to bring their trucks to our travel centers due to a break down. We also provide outsourced call center services to trucking fleets and other truck owners in place of their internal call centers, which customers may use on a full time basis or for only a portion of a day, on certain days of the week or for certain designated periods. As of December 31, 2020, we provided outsourced call center services to 107 customers, including 66 on a full time basis.
•TechOn-Site® offers truck and trailer mobile maintenance and repair services performed by certified technicians at customer facilities, with a fleet of approximately 280 trucks in service as of December 31, 2020. TechOn-Site® is designed to be a "bay on wheels" fully stocked with standard and specialty parts and state of the art technology that offers various services such as pre-trip truck inspections, U.S. Department of Transportation required inspections, tire repair and replacement, electric systems checks, brake inspections, truck refurbishings and complete lubrication services.
•TA Commercial Tire Network™ is a commercial tire program we began in late 2016 through which we sell a variety of branded tires at our truck repair and maintenance facilities, on customers' lots, distribution centers, through direct sales and under tire manufacturers' national fleet account programs. The TA Commercial Tire Network™ includes a tire retread facility that is part of the Goodyear Authorized Retread Network, providing a full line of Goodyear commercial tire retread products to fleets, local industries and tire dealers within a 150 mile radius of its location in Bowling Green, Ohio. Many of our truck service facilities have access to the retread tires produced at this plant. We believe the TA Commercial Tire Network™ is the most comprehensive commercial tire purchasing, monitoring and maintenance program in the United States.
Daimler Agreement. We are party to an agreement with Daimler. Daimler is the leading manufacturer of large trucks and truck engines in North America under the Freightliner, Western Star and Detroit Diesel brand names. Except for locations in Texas, our TA and Petro truck repair and maintenance facilities are authorized providers of repair work and specified warranty repairs to Daimler's customers. This is accomplished through the Freightliner ServicePoint® program at TA locations and through the Freightliner and/or Western Star ServicePoint® programs at our Petro locations. Our TA and Petro truck maintenance and repair facilities are also part of Freightliner's 24 hour customer assistance database for emergency and roadside repair referrals and we have access generally to Daimler's parts distribution, service and technical information systems.
Competition
Fuel and nonfuel products and services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional full service travel centers and pumper only truck stops, some of which are owned or franchised by large chains and some of which are independently owned and operated, and some large service stations. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide fuel and services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Some of our competitors may have more resources than we do and vertically integrated fuel and other businesses which may provide them competitive advantages. For all of these reasons and others, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
We believe that although the travel center and truck stop industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 6,300 travel centers and truck stops in the United States, the largest trucking fleets tend to purchase the majority of their fuel from us and our two largest competitors. Based on the number of locations, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, Love's and TA are the three largest companies focused principally on the travel center industry. We believe that in recent years, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love's, added significantly more travel centers to their networks than we added to our network, and in some cases, competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love's has impacted our unit results. Nevertheless, we believe we are able to compete successfully in part because many of our travel centers were originally developed years ago when prime real estate locations along the U.S. interstate highway system were more readily available than they are today, which we believe would make it difficult to fully replicate our travel center business, and also in part because of our full service offerings and larger locations that are not often replicated by our principal competitors. We compete with other travel center and truck stop chains based primarily on diesel fuel prices and the quality, variety and pricing of our nonfuel products, services and amenities. 
Our truck repair and maintenance facilities compete with other providers of truck repair and maintenance facilities, including some at Pilot and Love's locations. These two competitors have increased their respective numbers of truck repair and maintenance facilities and service offerings over the past several years. For truck maintenance and repair services, we also compete with regional full service travel center and smaller truck stop chains, full service independently owned and operated travel centers and truck stops, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. We also compete with other FSRs, QSRs, mass merchandisers, electronics stores, drugstores, gasoline stations and convenience stores. Some truck fleets own their own fuel and repair and maintenance facilities; however, we believe the long term trend has been toward a reduction in these facilities in favor of obtaining fuel and repair and maintenance services from third parties like us. We believe that we are able to compete successfully because we offer consistent, high quality products and services, and our nationwide travel centers provide an advantage to large trucking fleets, particularly long haul trucking fleets, by enabling them to (i) take advantage of efficiencies afforded by the wide array of products and services our travel centers provide for their equipment and their drivers and (ii) reduce the number of their suppliers by routing their trucks through our travel centers nationwide.
An additional source of competition in the future could result from commercialization of state owned interstate highway rest areas. Some state governments have historically requested that the federal government allow these rest areas to offer fuel and nonfuel products and services similar to that offered at a travel center and certain congressional leaders have historically supported such legislation. If commercialized, these rest areas may increase the number of locations competing with us and these rest areas may have significant competitive advantages over existing travel centers, including ours, because they are generally located on restricted (i.e., toll) roads and have dedicated ingress and egress. 
Our Leases with SVC
We have five leases with SVC, four of which we refer to as the TA Leases and one of which we refer to as the Petro Lease, and which we refer to collectively as the SVC Leases.
SVC Leases. Pursuant to the SVC Leases, we lease 144 properties under the TA Leases and 35 properties under the Petro Lease. One of our subsidiaries is the tenant under the leases, and we guarantee the tenant's obligations under the leases.
Term. The TA Leases expire on December 31, 2029, 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Petro Lease expires on June 30, 2035. We may extend each of these leases for up to two additional periods of 15 years.
Annual Minimum Rent. As of December 31, 2020, our aggregate annual minimum rent payable to SVC under the SVC Leases was $243.9 million. We may request that SVC purchase approved renovations, improvements and equipment additions we make at the leased properties, in return for an increase in our annual minimum rent equal to the amount paid by SVC multiplied by the greater of (i) 8.5% or (ii) a benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rate plus 3.5%. SVC is not required to purchase any improvements and we are not required to sell any improvements to SVC. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not sell to SVC any improvements we made to properties leased from SVC.
Percentage Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we incur percentage rent payable to SVC. The percentage rent is 3.5% of the excess of nonfuel revenues for any particular year over the percentage rent base year amount.
Deferred Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we owed deferred rent to SVC in an aggregate amount of $70.5 million, which became payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2019. The total amount of deferred rent outstanding as of December 31, 2020, was $39.6 million. Interest does not accrue on this deferred rent obligation, subject to exceptions. This deferred rent obligation may be accelerated by SVC and become due on an earlier date and interest shall begin to accrue thereon upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control of us.
Other terms of the SVC Leases have not materially changed since December 31, 2019. For more information about the terms of the SVC Leases, please refer to Part I, Item 1. "Business – Our Leases with SVC" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report.

Regulatory Environment
Environmental Regulation
Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the SVC Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify SVC for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from SVC and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. We have entered into certain other arrangements in which we have agreed to indemnify third parties for environmental liabilities and expenses resulting from our operations. 
For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, see the disclosure under the heading "Environmental Contingencies" in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. of this Annual Report. In addition, for more information about these environmental and weather events and climate change matters and about the risks which may arise as a result, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including "Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," Item 1A. "Risk Factors," and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis – Environmental and Climate Change Matters."
Franchise Regulation
Subject to certain exemptions, the Federal Trade Commission regulations require that we make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and some states require state registration and delivery of specified disclosure documentation to potential franchisees. Some state laws also impose restrictions on our ability to terminate or not renew franchises and impose other limitations on the terms of our franchise relationships or the conduct of our franchise business. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act imposes special regulations on franchises where petroleum products are offered for sale. Also, a number of states include, within the scope of their petroleum franchising statutes, prohibitions against price discrimination and other allegedly anticompetitive conduct. These provisions supplement applicable federal and state antitrust laws. We believe that we are in compliance with all franchise laws applicable to our business.
Gaming Regulation
Because we have gaming operations at some of our travel centers, we and our concerned subsidiaries are currently subject to gaming regulations in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Requirements under gaming regulations vary by jurisdiction but include, among other things:
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to, or licensure of, certain of our and our licensed subsidiaries' directors, officers and key employees and certain individuals having a material relationship with us or our licensed subsidiaries;
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to certain of our security holders and restrictions on ownership of certain of our securities;
•prior approval in certain circumstances by the relevant gaming authorities of offerings of our securities;
•prior approval by the relevant gaming authorities of changes in control of us; and
•specified reporting requirements.
Holders of beneficial interests of our voting securities are subject to licensing or suitability investigations by the relevant gaming authorities under various circumstances including, generally, service on our Board of Directors, the attainment of certain levels of ownership of a class of our voting securities, or involvement in the gaming operations of or influence over us or our licensed subsidiaries. Persons or entities seeking to acquire control of us or our operation of the license are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities. Any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required by a relevant gaming authority to file an application and have their suitability reviewed in certain circumstances, including if the gaming authority has reason to believe that such ownership of our voting securities would otherwise be inconsistent with its state's gaming laws. In some jurisdictions, the applicant must pay all costs of investigations incurred in connection with such investigations. Additionally, in the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a person or entity is unsuitable to be an owner of our securities, such person would be prohibited from, among other things, receiving any dividend or interest upon such securities, exercising any voting right conferred through such securities or continuing to hold our securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by such gaming authority, managing the licensed business and, in some cases, the stockholders may be required to divest themselves of our voting securities.
Certain of our and our subsidiaries' directors and officers must also file applications, be investigated and be licensed or found suitable by the relevant gaming authorities in order to hold such positions. In the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a director, officer, key employee or individual with whom we or our licensed subsidiary have a material relationship is unsuitable, we or our licensed subsidiary, as applicable, may be required to sever our relationships with such individual or such individual may be prohibited from serving as our director or officer.
Any violations by us or any of our licensed subsidiaries of the gaming regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties (including the limiting, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any licenses held) and criminal actions. Additionally, certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports regarding those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
We have a Gaming Compliance Plan, or the Compliance Plan, as required by the Nevada Gaming Commission in connection with our gaming operations at certain of our travel center locations. In connection with the Compliance Plan, we have a Gaming Compliance Committee, or the Compliance Committee, on which a member of our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors serves as the Board of Directors' liaison to the Compliance Committee pursuant to the terms of the Compliance Plan. The Compliance Committee assists us in monitoring activities relating to our continuing qualifications under applicable gaming laws.
Seasonality
Our sales volume is generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of each calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, the quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our real estate rent expense and certain other costs do not vary seasonally. The COVID-19 pandemic and current economic conditions have significantly altered, and may in the future impact, the seasonal aspects of our business, including that we did not realize in 2020 the increased business we typically experience in the fourth quarter.
Human Capital Resources
Our core mission is to “Return every traveler to the road better than they came.” Our five values, Welcoming, Empathetic, Integrity, Openness and Team Player, define the behaviors we expect from our employees and we maintain and enforce our Diversity Statement. We have a longstanding history of supporting the professional truck drivers who keep the U.S. economy moving and those who have served our country, including both retired and active-duty military. We are committed to supporting the local communities we serve.
During 2020, we embarked on a company wide Reorganization Plan that included senior leadership appointments, resulting in an experienced and strategic management team tasked with improving our operational efficiency, profitability and diversity. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 18,700 employees with 4.8% employed at our corporate headquarters and 95.2% across 249 locations throughout the United States. Approximately 70.3% of our field employees were classified as full-time employees and the average tenure of our employees was four years. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, marital status, ancestry, sex, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, handicap, military service or veteran status, genetic information or membership in any other category protected by applicable federal, state or local law. Diversity and inclusion are an important part of our hiring, retention and development programs. As of December 31, 2020, 47.2% and 37.0% of our employees were female and non-white, respectively, and 43.0% and 29.0% of our Board of Directors were female and non-white, respectively.
Our employee engagement, immersion and training initiatives center around our Mission Vision & Values. Our recruiting, on-boarding and retention programs and development and on-going training programs currently include the following:
•National Training Center. We maintain a national training center in Lodi, Ohio where we host educational programs to develop employees by teaching new skills and relevant technological changes.
•Manager in Training Program. This training program assists non-management and new management employees in learning the skills and experience to help enable them to advance their career and benefit our business and operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 364 field employees were promoted from non-manager to management level positions.
•Healthy Journeys Wellness Plan. We value the health and well-being of all our employees. For this reason, we offer the Healthy Journeys Wellness Program to help eligible employees and their spouses manage their health while controlling their family's healthcare costs. The program includes many resources to support wellness, including online health courses and a smoking cessation program.
•Educational Assistance Plan. Eligible employees can participate in TA’s Educational Assistance Plan for tuition reimbursement. We pay up to 75.0% of the cost of tuition and certain fees for any approved course taken by a regular full-time employee at an accredited high school, university or college, trade, business or correspondence school. Eligible truck service technicians who graduated from a certified technical school and have education related loan repayment obligations can also earn funds to repay their loan.
