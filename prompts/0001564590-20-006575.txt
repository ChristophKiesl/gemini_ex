Item 1. Business
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Horizon Therapeutics plc (formerly known as Horizon Pharma plc) and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Overview
 We are focused on researching, developing and commercializing medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare and rheumatic diseases.  Our pipeline is purposeful: we apply scientific expertise and courage to bring clinically meaningful therapies to patients.  We believe science and compassion must work together to transform lives.

Our Strategy
 Horizon today is a leading biopharma company focused on rare diseases, delivering innovative therapies to patients and generating value for our shareholders.  We are strongly focused on executing our strategy to maximize the benefit and value of our key growth drivers and expand our pipeline for sustainable growth.
 We have taken a different approach from typical biopharma companies.  Instead of starting with a pipeline and raising capital to finance development opportunities, after our initial public offering in 2011, we developed a successful commercial business.  Our initial portfolio of two medicines generated cash flows and significant growth, establishing a strong foundation for our future.  
 Beginning in 2014, we deployed the cash flows in building out our portfolio of rare disease medicines, including the acquisition of our key growth driver KRYSTEXXA®, and now have seven rare disease medicines.  One of those medicines is TEPEZZA™ (teprotumumab-trbw), our other key growth driver, which we acquired in 2017 as part of our acquisition of River Vision Development Corp., or River Vision. 
 TEPEZZA represents the evolution of our strategy to its third – and current phase – expanding our pipeline and maximizing the value of our medicines, in particular our growth drivers KRYSTEXXA and TEPEZZA and expanding our pipeline for sustainable growth.  To support our pipeline strategy, we expanded our research and development organization, adding an experienced leadership team and augmenting the organization’s capabilities.  It was our new leadership team that drove the successful Phase 3 clinical program and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval of TEPEZZA in early 2020.  
 Today, in addition to reinvesting in our key growth drivers, our priority is to expand our pipeline, concentrating on developing a deeper presence in our four core therapeutic areas of rheumatology, nephrology, ophthalmology and endocrinology.  
 We have significantly transformed Horizon since our beginnings as a public company in 2011, then with two medicines and total net sales of approximately $7.0 million.  In a span of only eight years, we have evolved to a biopharma company with eleven on-market medicines, seven of them for the treatment of rare diseases, total net sales in 2019 of $1.3 billion, and a growing pipeline of development programs.  
 Prior to 2020, our two reportable segments were (i) the orphan and rheumatology segment and (ii) the inflammation segment (previously the primary care segment).  The orphan and rheumatology segment is our strategic growth segment.  Effective in the first quarter of 2020, we (i) reorganized our commercial operations and moved responsibility for RAYOS® to the inflammation segment and (ii) renamed the orphan and rheumatology segment the orphan segment. With the approval of TEPEZZA on January 21, 2020, net sales generated by this medicine will be reported as part of the renamed orphan segment.

Information on our total revenues by product in each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is included in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 ORPHAN AND RHEUMATOLOGY
 During 2019, our orphan and rheumatology segment included the marketed medicines, KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, RAYOS, BUPHENYL and QUINSAIR. In January 2020, the FDA approved TEPEZZA for the treatment of TED.
KRYSTEXXA
 A PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme (uricase), KRYSTEXXA is the first and only FDA approved medicine for the treatment of uncontrolled gout.  Uncontrolled gout occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid, or sUA, and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with conventional therapies, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors, or XOIs, at the maximum medically appropriate dose, or for whom these drugs are contraindicated. 
 KRYSTEXXA has a unique mechanism of action that can rapidly reverse disease progression.  Unlike conventional XOI therapies, which address the over-production or under-excretion of uric acid, KRYSTEXXA converts uric acid into allantoin, a water-soluble molecule, which the body can easily eliminate through the urine.  Renal excretion of allantoin is ten times more efficient than uric acid excretion.  Additionally, many chronic kidney disease, or CKD, patients have gout, and the disease tends to be more prevalent as CKD advances.  While conventional XOI gout therapies can place additional burden on the kidneys and have dosing limitations, KRYSTEXXA has been proven effective and safe for uncontrolled gout patients with CKD without the need to adjust dosing. 
 Gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis and can be assessed by a simple blood test for the amounts of uric acid in the blood (sUA levels).  Typically in gout, when uric acid levels are greater than 6.8 milligrams per deciliter, urate will crystallize and deposit.  These hard deposits are known as tophi and may occur anywhere in the body, including joints, as well as organs, such as the kidney and heart.  When under-treated medically, tophi often lead to bone erosions and loss of functional ability.  Gout flares, a common characteristic of uncontrolled gout, are intensely painful.  They may or may not be accompanied by tophi.  A systemic disease, uncontrolled gout frequently causes crippling disabilities and significant joint damage. Of the 9.5 million gout sufferers in the United States, we estimate that greater than 100,000 patients have uncontrolled gout.   

5

KRYSTEXXA was approved by the FDA in 2010 following the results of two replicate clinical trials six months in duration involving 85 patients treated with KRYSTEXXA.  The mean baseline sUA levels for patients in the trial were greater than 10 mg/dL, and 71 percent of patients had visible tophi.  The primary endpoint for the trials was the ability to maintain a low sUA for 80 percent of the samples taken at months three and six.  As a result of the every-other-week dosing of KRYSTEXXA at 8 mg, 42 percent of KRYSTEXXA patients achieved complete response versus 0 percent for the placebo group; and 45 percent of KRYSTEXXA patients achieved complete resolution of tophi versus 8 percent for the placebo group over six months.
 We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the potential of KRYSTEXXA by expanding our commercialization efforts, as well as investing in education, patient and physician outreach, activities related to label expansion and investigation programs that demonstrate KRYSTEXXA as an effective treatment for uncontrolled gout.  We believe that KRYSTEXXA represents a significant opportunity and potential growth driver for our company. 
 We doubled our KRYSTEXXA commercial team in 2018, we increased our promotional efforts to further penetrate rheumatology and initiate marketing to nephrology and we are growing our customer base from both new and existing prescribers.  In 2019, we added a separate group of sales representatives to call exclusively on nephrologists.  We believe KRYSTEXXA offers a solution to a clinical need experienced by many nephrologists in dealing with uncontrolled gout patients with CKD.    
 
As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, KRYSTEXXA faces limited direct competition.  We believe that the complexity of manufacturing KRYSTEXXA provides a barrier to potential biosimilar competition.  However, a number of competitors have medicines in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials, including Selecta Biosciences, Inc., which has presented Phase 2 clinical data and is conducting a six-month trial comparing their candidate that uses an immunomodulator to KRYSTEXXA alone.
 RAVICTI
 RAVICTI is formed by the catalyzed esterification of glycerol with 4-phenylbutyric acid and the subsequent purification of the glycerol phenylbutyrate formed. The purified glycerol phenylbutyrate drug substance is filled into glass bottles for use as an oral dosage liquid.
 RAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients (beginning at birth) with urea cycle disorders, or UCDs, that cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.  UCDs are rare, life-threatening genetic disorders.  RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (for example, essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline or protein-free calorie supplements). 
 UCDs are inherited metabolic diseases caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes or transporters that constitute the urea cycle.  The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which ammonia, a potent neurotoxin, is converted to urea, which is excreted in the urine.  UCD patients may experience episodes during which the ammonia levels in their blood become excessively high, called hyperammonemic crises, which may result in irreversible brain damage, coma or death.  We estimate that there are approximately 2,600 patients with UCDs living in the United States, including approximately 1,000 diagnosed patients.
 UCD symptoms may first occur at any age depending on the severity of the disorder, with more severe defects presenting earlier in life.  However, a prompt diagnosis and careful management of the disease can lead to good clinical outcomes.
 RAVICTI competes with older-generation nitrogen scavenger medicines.  In the United States, RAVICTI competes with generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, including BUPHENYL.  RAVICTI has advantages over older-generation medicines leading to better patient adherence and compliance rates, such as its better tolerability for patients.  It is ingested by mouth and therefore requires little preparation and it has little taste and lower sodium content than its competitors.  A few competitors have medicine candidates in early-stage development, including a gene-therapy candidate by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., a generic taste-masked formulation option of BUPHENYL by ACER Therapeutics Inc., and an enzyme replacement for a specific UCD subtype (ARG) by Aeglea Bio Therapeutics Inc. If successful, these medicine candidates could compete with RAVICTI.
 6

Our strategy for RAVICTI is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of UCDs; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate based on the medicine’s differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and increase compliance rates.  
 On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.  We previously distributed RAVICTI through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. We have retained rights to RAVICTI in North America and Japan.
 
PROCYSBI
 PROCYSBI is indicated for nephropathic cystinosis, or NC, a rare and life-threatening metabolic disorder.  PROCYSBI capsules contain cysteamine bitartrate in the form of innovative microspheronized beads that are individually coated to create delayed and extended-release properties, allowing patients to maintain consistent therapeutic systemic drug levels over a twelve-hour dosing period.  The enteric-coated beads are pH sensitive and bypass the stomach for dissolution and absorption in the more alkaline environment of the proximal small intestine.  Randomized controlled clinical trials and extended treatment with PROCYSBI therapy demonstrated consistent cystine depletion as monitored by levels of the biomarker (and surrogate marker), white blood cell cystine.
 In February 2020, the FDA approved PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets for adults and children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis.  The PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets product is the same as the currently available PROCYSBI capsules product except in respect of the packaging format.  This new dosage form provides another administration option for patients, in addition to the PROCYSBI capsules.  The PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets are expected to be commercially available in the first half of 2020.
 PROCYSBI is differentiated by its ability to control cystine concentration continuously over twelve hours.  Older therapies require administration of medicine every six hours.  By taking PROCYSBI, patients have to dose only twice a day, providing them greater control over their medication schedule and lifestyle.  Additionally, because PROCYSBI can be administered through a feeding tube or mixed with approved foods and beverages, the patient can choose a more flexible dosing regimen.  PROCYSBI also has fewer known side effects, such as less severe body odor, than older-generation therapies. 
 We estimate that there are approximately 500 patients diagnosed with cystinosis living in the United States.  NC comprises 95 percent of known cases of cystinosis.  In these patients, elevated cystine can lead to cellular dysfunction and death; without treatment, the disease is usually fatal by the end of the first decade of life.  Cystinosis is progressive, eventually causing irreversible tissue damage and multi-organ failure, including kidney failure, blindness, muscle wasting and premature death.  NC is usually diagnosed in infancy after children display symptoms to physicians, including markedly increased urination, thirst, dehydration, gastrointestinal distress, failure to thrive, rickets, photophobia and kidney symptoms specific to Fanconi syndrome.  Management of cystinosis requires lifelong therapy.
 In addition to patients who have already been identified, we believe that a number of patients with atypical phenotypic presentation and end-stage renal disease have their condition as a result of undiagnosed late-onset NC and would benefit from treatment with PROCYSBI.
 Other than PROCYSBI, we are aware of two pharmaceutical products currently approved to treat cystinosis, Cystagon® and Cystaran®.  Cystagon, an immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsule, is an older-generation systemic cystine-depleting therapy for cystinosis in the United States marketed by Mylan N.V., and by Orphan Europe SARL in markets outside of the United States.  Cystagon is PROCYSBI’s primary competitor.  Cystaran, a cysteamine ophthalmic solution, is approved in the United States for treatment of corneal crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis and is marketed by Leadiant Biosciences, Inc.  Additionally, we are also aware that AVROBIO, Inc., has an early-stage gene therapy candidate in development for the treatment of cystinosis.  We believe that PROCYSBI will continue to be well received in the market and continue to expect Cystagon to be the primary competitor for PROCYSBI for the foreseeable future. 
 7

Our strategy for PROCYSBI is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the uptake of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates. 
 ACTIMMUNE
 ACTIMMUNE is indicated for chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD, and severe, malignant osteopetrosis, or SMO.  It is a biologically manufactured protein called interferon gamma-1b that is similar to a protein the human body makes naturally.  Interferon gamma helps prevent infection in CGD patients and enhances osteoclast function in SMO patients.   ACTIMMUNE is the only medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with CGD and for delaying disease progression in patients with SMO.  ACTIMMUNE is believed to work by modifying the cellular function of various cells, including those in the immune system and those that help form bones.
 CGD is a genetic disorder of the immune system.  It is described as a primary immunodeficiency disorder, which means it is not caused by another disease or disorder.  In people who have CGD, a type of white blood cell called a phagocyte is defective.  These defective phagocytes cannot generate superoxide, leading to an inability to kill harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.  As a result, the immune system is weakened.  People with CGD are more likely to have certain problems, such as recurrent severe bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammatory conditions.  These patients are prone to developing masses called granulomas, which can occur repeatedly in organs throughout the body and cause a variety of problems.  We estimate that there are approximately 1,600 patients with CGD in the United States.
 SMO is a form of osteopetrosis and is sometimes referred to as marble bone disease or malignant infantile osteopetrosis because it occurs in very young children.  While exact numbers are not known, it has been estimated that one out of 250,000 children is born with SMO. 
 ACTIMMUNE currently faces limited competition.  There are additional or alternative approaches used to treat patients with CGD and SMO, including the increasing trend towards the use of bone marrow transplants in patients with CGD, however, there are currently no medicines on the market that compete directly with ACTIMMUNE. 
 Our strategy with respect to ACTIMMUNE, our medicine for the treatment of CGD, includes increasing awareness and diagnosis of CGD and increasing compliance rates.
 RAYOS
 RAYOS is indicated for the treatment of multiple conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, or RA; ankylosing spondylitis, or AS; polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR; primary systemic amyloidosis; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE; and a number of other conditions.  We focus our promotion of RAYOS on rheumatology indications, including RA and PMR.
 RAYOS is composed of an active core containing prednisone that is encapsulated by an inactive porous shell, and acts as a barrier between the medicine’s active core and the patient’s gastrointestinal, or GI, fluids.  RAYOS was developed using Vectura’s proprietary GeoClock™ and GeoMatrix™ technologies, for which we hold an exclusive worldwide license for the delivery of glucocorticoid, a class of corticosteroid.  The delivery system enables a delayed release, synchronizing the prednisone delivery time with the patient’s elevated cytokine levels, thereby taking effect at a physiologically optimal point to inhibit cytokine production, and thus significantly reducing the signs and symptoms of RA and PMR.
 RA is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling, primarily in the joints; PMR is an inflammatory disorder that causes significant muscle pain and stiffness; SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects women and causes inflammation and pain in the joints and muscles as well as overall fatigue.
 RAYOS competes with a number of medicines in the market to treat RA, including corticosteroids, such as prednisone; traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, such as methotrexate; and biologic agents, such as Humira and Enbrel.  The majority of RA patients are treated with DMARDs, which are typically used as initial therapy in patients with RA.  Biologic agents are typically added to DMARDs as combination therapy.  It is common for an RA patient to take a combination of a DMARD, an oral corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, and/or a biologic agent. 
 8

Outside the United States, RAYOS is sold and marketed as LODOTRA.  Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura.  Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed.  These transfer activities are ongoing.  We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.  See “Manufacturing, Commercial, Supply and License Agreements” below for further details of the amendments.
 
BUPHENYL
 BUPHENYL tablets and BUPHENYL powder are made from granules that contain sodium phenylbutyrate as the active (chemically synthesized) ingredient and microcrystalline cellulose as a diluent.
 BUPHENYL tablets for oral administration and BUPHENYL powder for oral, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tube administration are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase or argininosuccinic acid synthetase.
 BUPHENYL is indicated in all patients with neonatal-onset deficiency (complete enzymatic deficiency, presenting within the first twenty-eight days of life).  It is also indicated in patients with late-onset disease (partial enzymatic deficiency, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonemic encephalopathy.  It is important that the diagnosis be made early and treatment initiated immediately to improve chances of survival.  BUPHENYL must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation.  We distribute BUPHENYL in the United States. 
 On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.  We previously distributed AMMONAPS through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. We have retained rights to BUPHENYL in North America and Japan. 
 QUINSAIR
 QUINSAIR is a formulation of the antibiotic drug levofloxacin, suitable for inhalation via a nebulizer and indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF.  CF is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 people worldwide, and results in buildup of abnormally thick secretions that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death.   
 QUINSAIR’s route of delivery allows higher concentrations of drug in the lung sputum than can be achieved via systemic (for example, oral) administration.  QUINSAIR, as approved in Canada and Latin America, is administered twice daily in twenty-eight-day cycles, using a hand-held nebulizer with a disposable handset known as the Zirela® device, manufactured by our partner PARI Pharma GmbH, or PARI, and configured specifically for use with QUINSAIR.  QUINSAIR is not approved in the United States.
 Chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are currently treated primarily with inhaled antibiotics, including tobramycin, an aminoglycoside-class antibiotic sold by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation as TOBI® or in dry-powder-inhalation format as TOBI Podhaler® and sold by others in generic form, aztreonam, a monobacter-class antibiotic which is marketed in an inhaled formulation by Gilead Sciences, Inc. under the tradename Cayston®, and colistimethate sodium, a polymixin-class antibiotic which is approved and marketed in inhaled formulations in Europe.  Tobramycin, aztreonam and colistimethane are primarily effective against gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  However, the prevalence of multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is growing.  Thus, we believe there is an unmet need that might be addressed with a new class of inhaled antibiotic such as the fluoruquinolone class that levofloxacin represents.

TEPEZZA
 TEPEZZA is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a targeted inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, or IGF-1R, that is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED.  TED is a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. While TED often occurs in people living with hyperthyroidism or Graves’ disease, it is a distinct disease that is caused by autoantibodies activating an IGF-1R-mediated signaling complex on cells within the retro-orbital space. This leads to a cascade of negative effects, which may cause long-term, irreversible eye damage. As TED progresses, it causes serious damage – including proptosis (eye bulging), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) and diplopia (double vision) – and in some cases can lead to blindness.  Historically, patients have had to live with TED until the inflammation subsides, after which they are often left with permanent and vision-impairing consequences and may require multiple surgeries that do not completely return the patient to their pre-disease state.
 TEPEZZA was approved by the FDA in January 2020 following the positive results from the Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as the Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, OPTIC. The OPTIC trial found that significantly more patients treated with TEPEZZA (82.9%) had a meaningful improvement in proptosis (≥ 2 mm) as compared with placebo patients (9.5%) (p˂0.001) without deterioration in the fellow eye at Week 24. Additional secondary endpoints were also met, including a change from baseline of at least one grade in diplopia (double vision) in 67.9% of patients receiving TEPEZZA compared to 28.6% of patients receiving placebo (p=0.001) at Week 24. In a related analysis of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, there were more patients with complete resolution of diplopia among those treated with TEPEZZA (53%) compared with those treated with placebo (25%). The majority of adverse events experienced with TEPEZZA treatment were graded as mild to moderate and were manageable in the trials, with few discontinuations or therapy interruptions.
 Our commercialization strategy for TEPEZZA is focused on four pillars:  establishing the market structure and simplifying the diagnosis and treatment of TED for patients; educating the multiple stakeholders about TED and TEPEZZA; supporting the commercialization of TEPEZZA with our comprehensive approach and patient-centric model; and facilitating access to TEPEZZA by establishing an infusion site-of-care referral process for treating physicians who may not have infusion capabilities. 
 As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of TED, TEPEZZA has no direct approved competition.  We believe that the results of the TEPEZZA Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials present a significantly high hurdle for potential competitors, given that candidate medicines would be expected to demonstrate similar or greater efficacy in the treatment of TED.  In addition, the complexity of manufacturing TEPEZZA could pose a barrier to potential biosimilar competition. Although TEPEZZA does not face direct competition, other therapies, such as corticosteroids, have been used on an off-label basis to alleviate some of the symptoms of TED.  While these therapies have not proved effective in treating the underlying disease, and carry with them significant side effects, their off-label use could reduce or delay treatment with TEPEZZA in the addressable patient population.  Immunovant Inc. is also conducting clinical studies of a medicine candidate for the treatment of active TED, also referred to as Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
 

INFLAMMATION 
 During 2019, our inflammation segment included PENNSAID 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO.
 PENNSAID 2%
 PENNSAID 2% is indicated for the treatment of pain of osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee(s).  OA is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. 
 An analgesic that is easy-to-apply topically directly to the knee, PENNSAID 2% contains diclofenac sodium, a commonly prescribed NSAID to treat OA pain, and dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO, a penetrating agent that helps ensure that diclofenac sodium is absorbed through the skin to the site of inflammation and pain.  Topical NSAIDs such as PENNSAID 2% are generally viewed as safer alternatives to oral NSAID treatment because they reduce systemic exposure to a fraction of that of an oral NSAID.  PENNSAID 2% is the only topical NSAID offered with the convenience of a metered-dose pump, which ensures that the patient receives the correct amount of PENNSAID 2% solution with each use.  PENNSAID 2% competes primarily with the generic version of Voltaren Gel, a market leader in the topical NSAID category. 
 
10

DUEXIS
 DUEXIS is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of RA and OA and to decrease the risk of developing upper-GI ulcers in patients who are taking ibuprofen for these indications.  RA is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling, primarily in the joints.
 DUEXIS provides a fixed-dose combination in tablet form of ibuprofen, the most widely prescribed NSAID, and famotidine, a well-established GI agent used to treat dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and active ulcers. 
 Fixed-dose combination therapy provides significant advantages over multiple-pill regimens: fixed-dose combinations can reduce the number of pills taken; ensure that the correct dosage of each component is taken at the correct time, improving compliance; and is often associated with better treatment outcomes.
 In general, DUEXIS faces competition from the separate use of NSAIDs for pain relief and GI medications to address the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers.  However, the prescribing information for DUEXIS states that DUEXIS should not be substituted with the single-ingredient products of ibuprofen and famotidine.  DUEXIS competes with other NSAIDs, including Celebrex®, manufactured by Pfizer Inc., and celecoxib, a generic form of the medicine supplied by other pharmaceutical companies.  DUEXIS also competes with TIVORBEX™ (indomethacin) capsules, VIVLODEX® (meloxicam) capsules and ZORVOLEX ® (diclofenac) capsules marketed by Iroko Pharmaceuticals, LLC.
 
VIMOVO
 VIMOVO is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of OA, RA and AS and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.  It is a proprietary, fixed-dose, delayed-release tablet that combines enteric-coated naproxen, an NSAID, surrounded by a layer of immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium.  Naproxen has proven anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and esomeprazole magnesium reduces the stomach acid secretions that can cause upper-GI ulcers.  Both naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium have well-documented and excellent long-term safety profiles, and both medicines have been used by millions of patients worldwide.  VIMOVO has been shown to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID associated gastric ulcers.
 Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., or collectively Dr. Reddy’s, who intends to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book.   The cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy’s advising that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit.  On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court’s invalidity ruling against the 6,926,907 and 8,557,285 patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets.  As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating the ‘907 and ‘285 patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy’s generic version of VIMOVO.  On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy’s generic version of VIMOVO.  We anticipate that Dr. Reddy’s will immediately launch its product at-risk notwithstanding the ongoing patent litigation.  Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Ajanta Pharma LTD, or Ajanta, intending to market a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book.  If we are unsuccessful in any of the VIMOVO cases, we will likely face generic competition with respect to VIMOVO and sales of VIMOVO will be substantially harmed.
 In addition, similar to DUEXIS, VIMOVO faces competition from the separate use of NSAIDs for pain relief and GI medications to address the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers.  However, the prescribing information for VIMOVO states that VIMOVO should not be substituted with the single-ingredient products of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium.  VIMOVO also competes with other NSAIDs, including Celebrex, TIVORBEX, VIVLODEX and ZORVOLEX.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs currently include pre-clinical and clinical development of new medicine candidates and activities related to label expansions for existing medicines.  We devote significant resources to research and development activities associated with our medicines and medicine candidates.  The graphic below summarizes our significant research and development activities in order of the program stage, from post-market to pre-clinical:

KRYSTEXXA MIRROR Randomized Clinical Trial
 KRYSTEXXA is a recombinant protein of uricase, an enzyme not found in humans, and PEGylation.  As with many biologic medicines, some people treated with KRYSTEXXA develop antidrug antibodies as part of an immune response to the medicine and lose response to therapy.
 We are evaluating ways to maximize KRYSTEXXA benefit to patients by improving its response rate.  In the KRYSTEXXA pivotal trials, 42 percent of patients achieved a complete response, defined as the proportion of sUA responders (sUA < 6 mg/dL) at Months 3 and 6.  While this is an impressive result relative to the response rate of biologic medicines used for other types of inflammatory arthritis, we are investigating ways to increase the number of patients who can achieve a complete response by co-administering KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate, an immunomodulator medicine commonly used by rheumatologists.  There is well-documented evidence that the addition of immunomodulators to biological therapies can decrease rates of immunogenicity, as the immunomodulators work to reduce the formation of anti-drug antibodies to the medicine, allowing it to maintain appropriate blood levels over a longer period of time.  MIRROR, our randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, was initiated in June 2019, and is expected to enroll 135 patients.  The trial is designed to support the potential for registration and modification of our KRYSTEXXA FDA label.  
 The MIRROR randomized trial was preceded by a smaller open-label study, which also evaluated the use of the immunomodulator methotrexate with KRYSTEXXA to increase the response rate and was completed in 2019.  Of the 14 patients in the study, 79 percent, or 11 patients, achieved a complete response, defined as the proportion of sUA responders (sUA < 6 mg/dL) at Month 6.  The 79 percent response rate is clinically importantly higher than the 42 percent response rate in the KRYSTEXXA Phase 3 clinical program, which evaluated KRYSTEXXA alone.  No new safety concerns associated with the combination were identified. 
 12

KRYSTEXXA PROTECT Study in Kidney Transplant Patients with Uncontrolled Gout
 PROTECT is an open-label clinical study evaluating the effect of KRYSTEXXA on sUA levels in adults with uncontrolled gout who have undergone a kidney transplant.  The objective of the study is to demonstrate that KRYSTEXXA provides effective disease control in a severe uncontrolled gout population.  Kidney transplant patients have more than a tenfold increase in the prevalence of gout when compared to the general population, and literature suggests that persistently high sUA levels can be associated with organ rejection.  Managing uncontrolled gout is one of the most common and significant unmet needs of kidney transplant patients.  The PROTECT study is expected to enroll 20 adults. 
 KRYSTEXXA Shorter-Infusion Duration Study 
 We expect to begin an initial proof of concept study in mid-2020 to evaluate the impact of administering KRYSTEXXA over a significantly shorter infusion duration.  Currently, KRYSTEXXA is infused over a two-hour long interval.  A shorter infusion duration could meaningfully improve the experience and convenience for patients, physicians and sites of care.  
 TEPEZZA OPTIC-X
 TEPEZZA is a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IGF-1R approved early in 2020 for the treatment of TED after an accelerated Priority Review by the FDA.  TEPEZZA is the first and only approved treatment for this serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition in which the muscles and fatty tissue behind the eye become inflamed and expand.  This can lead to proptosis (eye bulging) and diplopia (double vision) and seriously impact activities of daily living and patients’ quality of life.  In rare instances, it can result in compression of the optic nerve that can lead to blindness.  
 In 2019, we completed OPTIC, the TEPEZZA Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial.  Patients included in the study had a clinical diagnosis of TED.  The results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful:  82.9 percent of TEPEZZA patients achieved the primary endpoint, defined as a reduction of proptosis of at least 2mm (p<0.001), compared to 9.5 percent of placebo patients.  All secondary endpoints were met, and the manageable safety profile was consistent across the Phase 3 and Phase 2 trials. The trial results for both the TEPEZZA Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trial results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, a significant achievement.
OPTIC-X is an extension study of OPTIC and is currently ongoing.  Patients who participated in the OPTIC trial had the option to participate in the extension study and receive an additional eight infusions of TEPEZZA.  The results of OPTIC-X are expected to provide additional data on whether non-responders from the initial twenty-four weeks of treatment during OPTIC would benefit from longer treatment and if patients who lose response off drug after the initial twenty-four weeks of treatment would benefit from retreatment.
 TEPEZZA Diffuse Cutaneous Scleroderma
 We expect to initiate an exploratory TEPEZZA study in 2020 in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, a rare fibrotic disease with no approved treatment options, as part of our approach to evaluate additional indications for TEPEZZA. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma is a subtype of scleroderma in which excess collagen production causes skin thickening and hardening, or fibrosis, over large areas of the skin and internal organs. There can be significant associated organ damage, including to the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, lungs and heart. Literature suggests that the mechanism of action of TEPEZZA, which is to block the IGF-1R, could have an impact on fibrotic processes, such as those that are relevant to diffuse cutaneous scleroderma. The objective of the exploratory study is to evaluate biomarkers and safety, tolerability of TEPEZZA in patients with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and to inform potential subsequent larger and longer duration clinical trials.
HZN-003:  Potential Next-Generation Biologic for Uncontrolled Gout Using Optimized Uricase and Optimized PEGylation Technology 
 A potential biologic for uncontrolled gout, HZN-003 is a pre-clinical, genetically engineered uricase with optimized PEGylation technology that has the potential to improve the half-life and reduce immunogenicity of this molecule.  In addition, it has the potential for subcutaneous dosing.  We licensed HZN-003 from MedImmune LLC, the global biologics research and development arm of the AstraZeneca Group, in late 2017.  HZN-003 is a rheumatology pipeline program with the objective of enhancing our leadership position in the uncontrolled gout market. 

13

HZN-007:  PASylated Uricase for Uncontrolled Gout Using Optimized Uricase and PASylation Technology
 HZN-007 is a PASylated uricase, resulting from a collaboration program to identify uncontrolled gout biologic candidates.  HZN-007 is a pre-clinical medicine candidate, using PASylation technology as a biological alternative to synthetic PEGylation.  PASylation is a new approach for extending the half-life of pharmaceutically active proteins and reducing immunogenicity.  In addition, it has the potential for subcutaneous dosing.  
HemoShear Gout Discovery Collaboration
 We have a collaboration agreement with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC, a biotechnology company, to discover and develop novel therapeutics for gout.  The collaboration provides us an opportunity to address unmet treatment needs for people with gout by evaluating new targets for the control of sUA levels as well as new targets to address the inflammation associated with acute flares of gout.
 With the objective to enhance our leadership position in uncontrolled gout, HZN-003, HZN-007 and the HemoShear programs are all exploring innovative approaches to improve the treatment of this painful, debilitating systemic disease.
 
Distribution
 We use central third-party logistics and FDA-compliant warehouses for storage and distribution of our medicines into the supply chain.  Our third-party logistics providers specialize in integrated operations that include warehousing and transportation services that can be scaled and customized to our needs based on market conditions and the demands and delivery service requirements for our medicines and materials.  Their services eliminate the need to build dedicated internal infrastructures that would be difficult to scale without significant capital investment.  Our third-party logistics providers warehouse all medicines in controlled FDA-registered facilities.  Incoming orders are prepared and shipped through an order entry system to ensure just in time delivery of the medicines.
Sales and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2019, our sales force was composed of approximately 480 sales representatives consisting of approximately 75 orphan disease sales representatives (including approximately 50 TEPEZZA sales representatives), 170 rheumatology sales specialists and 235 inflammation sales representatives. 
 Our orphan and rheumatology sales representatives focus on marketing our orphan and rheumatology medicines to a limited number of healthcare practitioners who specialize in fields such as pediatric immunology, allergy, infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, rheumatology, nephrology, ophthalmology and endocrinology with the approval of TEPEZZA, to help them understand the potential benefits of our medicines.  We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, agreements with third parties for commercialization of our medicines outside the United States.
 We offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription.  In certain circumstances when a patient’s prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription.  Patients are able to fill prescriptions for our inflammation medicines through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, as well as other pharmacies.  In addition, we have business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our inflammation medicines.  The business arrangements with the PBMs generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions.
 We have a comprehensive compliance program in place to address adherence with various laws and regulations relating to our sales, marketing, and manufacturing of our medicines, as well as certain third-party relationships, including pharmacies.  Specifically with respect to pharmacies, the compliance program utilizes a variety of methods and tools to monitor and audit pharmacies, including those that participate in our patient assistance programs, to confirm their activities, adjudication and practices are consistent with our compliance policies and guidance.
 Manufacturing, Commercial, Supply and License Agreements
 We have agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and manufacturing of our medicines, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation, and distribution and logistics services for certain medicines.  In most cases, we retain certain levels of safety stock or maintain alternate supply relationships that we can utilize without undue disruption of our manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations.

KRYSTEXXA
 KRYSTEXXA is produced by fermentation of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacterium containing the DNA which encodes for uricase.  The complementary DNA coding for the uricase is based on mammalian sequences.  Uricase is purified and is then PEGylated with a PEGylation agent to produce the bulk medicine, pegloticase. PEGylation and purification of the active drug substance is achieved by conventional column chromatography.  The resulting highly purified sterile solution is filled in a single-use vial for intravenous infusion following dilution.  In support of its manufacturing process, we store multiple vials of the Escherichia coli bacterium master cell bank and working cell bank at multiple locations in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
NOF Supply Agreement
 In August 2015, Crealta Holdings LLC, or Crealta, and NOF Corporation, or NOF, in Japan, entered into an exclusive supply agreement for the PEGylation agent used in the manufacture of KRYSTEXXA.  We assumed this agreement as part of our acquisition of Crealta in January 2016, or the Crealta acquisition.  Under the terms of this agreement, we are required to issue NOF forecasts of our requirements for the PEGylation agent, a portion of which are binding.  The agreement expires in August 2020 and we expect to extend the agreement beyond this date.  Either we or NOF may also terminate the agreement upon a material breach, if not cured within a specified period of time, or in the event of the other party’s insolvency.  While there are no minimum purchase obligations under the agreement, we are required to use NOF as our exclusive supplier for the PEGylation agent, subject to certain exceptions if NOF is unable to supply the PEGylation agent.
Bio-Technology General (Israel) Supply Agreement
 In March 2007, Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (as predecessor in interest to Crealta), or Savient, entered into a commercial supply agreement with Bio-Technology General (Israel) Ltd, or BTG Israel, which was subsequently amended, for the production of the bulk KRYSTEXXA medicine, or bulk product.  We assumed this agreement as part of the Crealta acquisition and further amended the agreement in September 2016.  Under this agreement, we have agreed to purchase certain minimum annual order quantities and are obligated to purchase at least 80 percent of our annual world-wide bulk product requirements from BTG Israel.  The term of the agreement runs until December 31, 2030, and will automatically renew for successive three-year periods unless earlier terminated by either party upon three years’ prior written notice.  The agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in the event of a force majeure, liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, uncured material breach by the other party or after January 1, 2024, upon three years’ prior written notice.  Under this agreement, if the manufacture of the bulk product is moved out of Israel, we may be required to obtain the approval of the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist, or OCS, because certain KRYSTEXXA intellectual property was initially developed with a grant funded by the OCS and we may be required to pay the OCS additional amounts as a repayment for the OCS grant funding.  We issue eighteen-month forecasts of the volume of KRYSTEXXA that we expect to order.  The first six months of the forecasts are considered binding firm orders. 
Exelead PharmaSource Supply Agreement
 In October 2008, Savient and Exelead, Inc. (formerly known as Sigma Tau PharmaSource, Inc. (as successor in interest to Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)), or Exelead, entered into a commercial supply agreement, which was subsequently amended, for the packaging and supply of the final drug product KRYSTEXXA.  This agreement remains in effect until terminated, and either we or Exelead may terminate the agreement with three years notice, given thirty days prior to the agreement anniversary date.  Either we or Exelead may also terminate the agreement upon a material default, if not cured within a specified period of time, or in the event of the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy.
 15

Duke University and Mountain View Pharmaceutical License Agreement
 In August 1998, Savient entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Duke University, or Duke, and Mountain View Pharmaceuticals Inc., or MVP, which was subsequently amended, and which we acquired as part of the Crealta acquisition.  Duke developed the recombinant uricase enzyme used in KRYSTEXXA and MVP developed the PEGylation technology used in the manufacture of KRYSTEXXA. Duke and MVP may terminate the agreement if we commit fraud or for our willful misconduct or illegal conduct; upon our material breach of the agreement, if not cured within a specified period of time; upon written notice if we have committed two or more material breaches under the agreement; or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.  Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay Duke a mid-single digit percentage royalty on our global net sales of KRYSTEXXA and a royalty of between 5 percent and 15 percent on any global sublicense revenue.  We are also obligated to pay MVP a mid-single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of KRYSTEXXA outside of the United States and royalty of between 5 percent and 15 percent on any sublicense revenue outside of the United States. 
RAVICTI
 We have clinical and commercial supplies of glycerol phenylbutyrate API manufactured for us by two alternate suppliers, Helsinn Advanced Synthesis SA (Switzerland) and Patheon Austria GmbH & Co KG (formerly DSM Fine Chemicals Austria) on a purchase-order basis.  We have manufacturing agreements to manufacture finished RAVICTI drug product with Lyne Laboratories, Inc., Halo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and PCI Pharma Services.
Bausch Health Asset Purchase Agreement
 As a result of our acquisition of Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc., or Hyperion, in May 2015, or the Hyperion acquisition, we became subject to an asset purchase agreement with Bausch Health Companies, Inc. (formerly Ucyclyd Pharma, Inc.), or Bausch, pursuant to which we are obligated to pay to Bausch mid single-digit royalties on our global net sales of RAVICTI.  The asset purchase agreement cannot be terminated for convenience by either party.  We have a license to certain Bausch manufacturing technology, however Bausch is permitted to terminate the license if we fail to comply with any payment obligations relating to the license and do not cure such failure within a defined time period.
Brusilow License Agreement
 As a result of the Hyperion acquisition, we became subject to a license agreement, as amended, with Saul W. Brusilow, M.D. and Brusilow Enterprises, Inc., or Brusilow, pursuant to which we license patented technology related to RAVICTI from Brusilow.  Under such agreement, we are obligated to pay low-single digit royalties to Brusilow on net sales of RAVICTI that are, or were, covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent.  The license agreement may be terminated for any uncured breach as well as bankruptcy.  We may also terminate the agreement at any time by giving Brusilow prior written notice, in which case all rights granted to us would revert to Brusilow.
PROCYSBI
 PROCYSBI drug product is comprised of enteric-coated beads of cysteamine bitartrate encapsulated in gelatin capsules or packaged directly into packets.  PROCYSBI drug product and API, cysteamine bitartrate, are manufactured and packaged on a contract basis by third parties.
Patheon Manufacturing Services Agreement
 As a result of our acquisition of Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp, in October 2016, or the Raptor acquisition, we assumed a manufacturing services agreement, as amended, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Patheon, for the manufacture and supply of PROCYSBI.  Pursuant to the agreement, we must provide a rolling, non-binding forecast of PROCYSBI, with a portion of the forecast being a firm written order.  The agreement has a term that runs until December 31, 2021 and which automatically renews for successive two-year terms if not terminated at least eighteen months in advance. 
Cambrex Profarmaco Milano Supply Agreement
 As a result of the Raptor acquisition, we assumed an API supply agreement, as amended, with Cambrex Profarmaco Milano, or Cambrex. Pursuant to the agreement, we must provide rolling, non-binding forecasts, with a portion of the forecast being the minimum floor of the firm order that must be placed.  The Cambrex supply agreement has an initial term that runs until November 30, 2020, and which automatically renews for successive two-year terms if not terminated at least one year in advance.
 16

UCSD License Agreement
 In May 2017, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, San Diego, or UCSD, which was amended in September 2018.  We must pay UCSD a royalty in the mid-single digits on net sales of PROCYSBI in countries where PROCYSBI is covered by a patent right, and a royalty in the low-single digits on net sales of PROCYSBI in countries where PROCYSBI is not covered by a patent right.  Each such royalty is subject to reduction for sales of PROCYSBI in countries in the event a generic substitute for PROCYSBI is sold in such countries.  We must pay UCSD a minimum annual royalty in an amount less than $0.1 million.  Royalties terminate upon the later of (a) the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights on a country-by-country basis; and (b) twenty years after first commercial sale of PROCYSBI.  We must also pay UCSD a percentage in the mid-teens of any fees we receive from our sublicensees under the agreement that are not earned royalties.  We may also be obligated to pay UCSD aggregate developmental milestone payments of $0.3 million and aggregate regulatory milestone payments of $1.8 million for each orphan indication and aggregate developmental milestone payments of $0.8 million and aggregate regulatory milestone payments of $3.5 million for each non-orphan indication.  We are also subject to certain diligence obligations relating to performing activities for specified indications, including maintaining existing regulatory approvals for PROCYSBI and commercializing PROCYSBI in countries where regulatory approvals have been obtained and using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize certain other licensed medicines in the United States and other countries.  Under the terms of our agreement with Chiesi, royalties due to UCSD on sales of PROCYSBI in EMEA will be paid by Chiesi to us, which we will forward to UCSD unless we instruct Chiesi to make such payments directly to UCSD.
ACTIMMUNE
 ACTIMMUNE is a recombinant protein that is produced by fermentation of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacterium containing the DNA which encodes for the human protein.  Purification of the active drug substance is achieved by conventional column chromatography.  The resulting active drug substance is then formulated as a highly purified sterile solution and filled in a single-use vial for subcutaneous injection, which is the ACTIMMUNE finished drug product.  In support of its manufacturing process, we and Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or Boehringer Ingelheim, store multiple vials of the Escherichia coli bacterium master cell bank and working cell bank in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
Boehringer Ingelheim Supply Agreement
 In June 2017, we entered into an exclusive global supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals, pursuant to which Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals is required to manufacture and supply ACTIMMUNE and IMUKIN active drug substance and commercial quantities of the ACTIMMUNE and IMUKIN finished drug product.  Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals is our sole source supplier for ACTIMMUNE active drug substance and finished drug product.  Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to purchase minimum quantities of finished drug product during the term of the agreement.  Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals manufactures our commercial requirements of ACTIMMUNE based on our forecasts and the annual contractual minimum purchase quantity.  The supply agreement continues for an indefinite period but can be terminated by either party upon three years notice (but, in such case, cannot be terminated sooner than June 30, 2024), for an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, or upon certain changes of control of the other party.  We can terminate the supply agreement in the event we are prevented by regulatory authorities from distributing the product on the market for all indications.
License Agreements
 Under a license agreement, as amended, with Genentech Inc., or Genentech, who was the original developer of ACTIMMUNE, we are obligated to pay a low single-digit royalty to Genentech on our annual net sales of ACTIMMUNE.
 Either Genentech or we may terminate the agreement if the other party becomes bankrupt or defaults, however, in the case of a default, the defaulting party has thirty days to cure the default before the license agreement may be terminated.
 Under the terms of an assignment and option agreement with Connetics Corporation (which was the predecessor parent company to InterMune Pharmaceuticals Inc. and is now part of GlaxoSmithKline), or Connetics, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties to Connetics on our net sales of ACTIMMUNE in the United States.   
 17

RAYOS and LODOTRA
 We purchase the API for RAYOS from Tianjin Tianyao Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. in China and from Sanofi Chimie SA in France.  We have contracted with Jagotec AG, which is an affiliate of Vectura, for the production of RAYOS tablets and we entered into an agreement with Patheon for the packaging and assembling of RAYOS.
 Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which is also an affiliate of Vectura.  Under these amendments, we agreed to transfer all economic benefits of LODOTRA in Europe to Vectura during an initial transition period, with full rights transferring to Vectura when certain transfer activities have been completed.  These transfer activities are ongoing.  In exchange for transferring the LODOTRA economic benefits and rights, the royalty payable by us to Vectura in respect of RAYOS sales in North America was amended whereby, effective January 1, 2019, we were obligated to pay Vectura a mid-teens percentage royalty on our net sales, subject to a minimum royalty of $8.0 million per year, with the minimum royalty requirement expiring on December 31, 2022.  Under the amendments, we ceased recording LODOTRA revenue and we are no longer required to pay a royalty in respect of LODOTRA.  In addition, under the amendments, from January 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to a minimum purchase commitment in respect of the supply agreement with Jagotec AG.
 BUPHENYL
 When Hyperion purchased BUPHENYL, Hyperion assumed all of Bausch’s rights and obligations under its manufacturing agreements for the medicine.  We assumed these agreements when we acquired Hyperion.  We purchase API for BUPHENYL from CU Chemie Uetikon GmbH and final manufacturing, testing and packaging of the medicine is provided by Patheon UK Limited.
QUINSAIR
 QUINSAIR drug product, its API, levofloxacin hemihydrate, and the Zirela nebulizer device are all manufactured on a contract basis by third parties.  The API is exclusively supplied by TEVA API Inc.  QUINSAIR drug product is manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC.  Nebulizers are supplied by PARI in Starnberg, Germany. 
TEPEZZA
 TEPEZZA is produced by culture of a genetically engineered mammalian cell line containing the DNA which encodes for teprotumumab-trbw, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Cell culture broth is harvested and purified through filtration processes and chromatography processes prior to being formulated, frozen and shipped to the site of drug product manufacture.
 AGC Biologics Supply Agreement
 In February 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with AGC Biologics A/S (formerly known as CMC Biologics A/S), or AGC, which was amended in May 2019 and December 2019, for the supply of TEPEZZA drug substance. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to purchase certain minimum annual order quantities of TEPEZZA drug substance.  In addition, we must provide AGC with rolling forecasts of TEPEZZA drug substance requirements, with a portion of the forecast being a firm and binding order.  The agreement has a term that runs indefinitely.  Either party may terminate the agreement by giving notice at least three years in advance, but notice may not be given before February 14, 2022.  Either party may also terminate the agreement for the other party’s failure to pay any undisputed sum payable under the agreement within a specified period of time, for a material breach by the other party if not cured within a specified period of time, upon the other party’s insolvency, or in the event that any material permit or regulatory license is permanently revoked preventing the performance of specified services by the other party.Catalent Indiana Supply Agreement
 In December 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Catalent Indiana, LLC, or Catalent, for the supply of TEPEZZA drug product.  Pursuant to the agreement, we must provide Catalent with rolling forecasts of TEPEZZA drug product requirements, with a portion of the forecast being a firm and binding order.  The agreement has a term that runs until December 18, 2023, and automatically renews for two successive two-year terms unless terminated by either party at least two years in advance.  The agreement may be terminated earlier by either party for a material breach by the other party, if not cured within a specified period of time, or upon the other party’s insolvency.

Roche License Agreement 
 As a result of our acquisition of River Vision, we have a license of intellectual property rights to TEPEZZA under a license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., or Roche, effective as of June 15, 2011, as amended.  Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties between 9 and 12 percent on annual worldwide net sales.  The royalty terminates upon the later of (a) the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights on a country-by-country basis; and (b) ten years after first commercial sale of TEPEZZA.  We have paid development and regulatory milestones totaling CHF5.0 million relating to the United States and will pay an additional milestone payment of CHF5.0 million during the first quarter of 2020.  We may be obligated to pay Roche additional development and regulatory milestones for activities outside the United States or for additional indications.  We may also be obligated to pay Roche aggregate sales milestone payments totaling up to mid-double-digit million Swiss francs.  We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize TEPEZZA.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s breach of the agreement, if not cured within a specified period of time, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.  Roche may also terminate the agreement if we challenge the validity of Roche’s patents.  Upon providing written notice to Roche, we may also terminate the agreement within six-months of such notice before the first commercial sale of TEPEZZA or within nine months of such notice after the first commercial sale of TEPEZZA.  
Lundquist Institute License Agreement
 As a result of our acquisition of River Vision, we have a license of patent rights to TEPEZZA under a license agreement with Lundquist Institute (formerly known as Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center), or Lundquist, dated December 5, 2012.  Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to pay Lundquist a royalty payment of less than 1 percent of TEPEZZA net sales.  The royalty terminates upon the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights.  We may terminate the agreement upon sixty days’ prior written notice to Lundquist.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach of the agreement if not cured within a specified period of time.  Lundquist may also terminate the agreement in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.
Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals License Agreement
 As a result of our acquisition of River Vision, we have a license of certain manufacturing technology for TEPEZZA under a license agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals, effective as of December 21, 2016.  Pursuant to the agreement, we may be obligated to pay Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals milestone payments totaling low-single-digit million euros upon the achievement of certain TEPEZZA sales milestones.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach of the agreement if not cured within a specified period of time.  Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals may also terminate the agreement if we challenge the validity of certain of its patent rights.  
 In addition to the above supply and license agreements, under the agreement for the acquisition of River Vision, we are required to pay up to $325.0 million upon the attainment of various milestones, composed of $100.0 million related to FDA approval and $225.0 million related to net sales thresholds for TEPEZZA.  The agreement also includes a royalty payment of 3 percent of the portion of annual worldwide net sales exceeding $300.0 million (if any).  We will make a milestone payment of $100.0 million related to FDA approval during the first quarter of 2020. 
 PENNSAID 2%
 In October 2014, in connection with the acquisition of the U.S. rights to PENNSAID 2% from Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (formerly known as Nuvo Research Inc.), or Nuvo, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Nuvo, which was amended in February 2016, January 2017 and February 2018, under which Nuvo is obligated to manufacture and supply PENNSAID 2% to us.  The term of our supply agreement is through December 31, 2029, but the agreement may be terminated earlier by either party for any uncured material breach by the other party of its obligations under the supply agreement or upon the bankruptcy or similar proceeding of the other party.
 A key excipient used in PENNSAID 2% as a penetration enhancer is DMSO.  We and Nuvo rely on a sole proprietary form of DMSO for which we maintain a substantial safety stock.  However, should this supply become inadequate, damaged, destroyed or unusable, we and Nuvo may not be able to qualify a second source.
 19

DUEXIS
 We purchase DUEXIS in final, packaged form exclusively from Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, or Sanofi, for our commercial requirements in North America.  The first API in DUEXIS is ibuprofen in a direct compression blend called DC85 and is supplied to Sanofi by BASF Corporation, or BASF, in Bishop, Texas.  The second API in DUEXIS is famotidine, which is available from a number of international suppliers.  Famotidine is currently sourced from two manufacturers.  We currently receive both APIs in powder form and each is blended with a number of U.S. Pharmacopeia inactive ingredients. 
BASF 
 In July 2010, we entered into a contract with BASF for the purchase of DC85, which was subsequently amended effective as of January 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, which expired in December 2018, we were obligated to source a significant majority of our commercial demand for DC85 from BASF. During 2018, BASF notified customers that were being supplied by the Bishop manufacturing facility, including us, that it would not be renewing supply agreements due to a technical issue at the facility that has prevented it from supplying these customers.  During 2019, BASF has supplied us with a limited amount of DC85 and informed us of their intention to return to full supply.  While we consider our DUEXIS inventory on hand to be sufficient to meet current and future commercial requirements, we cannot guarantee that BASF’s manufacturing facility will return to full operations or we will be able to enter into a new supply agreement with BASF for DC85.
 Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi
 In May 2011, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Sanofi, which was amended in September 2013 and May 2018.  Pursuant to the agreement, Sanofi is obligated to manufacture and supply DUEXIS to us in final, packaged form, and we are obligated to purchase DUEXIS exclusively from Sanofi for our commercial requirements in North America and certain countries and territories in Europe, including the EU member states and Scandinavia, and South America.  Sanofi must acquire the components necessary to manufacture DUEXIS, including the APIs, and is obligated to acquire all DC85 under the terms of our agreements with suppliers. In order to allow Sanofi to perform its obligations under the agreement, we granted Sanofi a non-exclusive license to our related intellectual property.  The agreement term extends until September 2021, and automatically extends for successive two-year terms unless terminated by either party upon two years’ prior written notice.  Either party may terminate the agreement upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the other party in the event of breach by the other party that is not cured within thirty days of notice (which notice period may be longer in certain, limited situations) or in the event we lose regulatory approval to market DUEXIS in all countries worldwide, and either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon two years’ prior written notice to the other party at any time after the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of DUEXIS in any country worldwide.
VIMOVO
 We purchase VIMOVO in final, packaged form from Patheon for our commercial requirements in North America.  The first API in VIMOVO is naproxen which is supplied to Patheon by Divis Laboratories Limited in India.  The second API in VIMOVO is esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate, which we source from Minakem Holding SAS in France. 
 
Under a license agreement with Nuvo (formerly Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.), we are required to pay Nuvo a 10 percent royalty based on net sales of VIMOVO sold by us, our affiliates or sublicensees during the royalty term, subject to a minimum annual royalty obligation of $7.5 million, which minimum royalty obligations will continue for each year during which one of Nuvo’s patents covers VIMOVO in the United States and there are no competing medicines in the United States.  The royalty rate may be reduced to a mid-single digit royalty rate as a result of loss of market share to competing medicines.

Intellectual Property
 Our objective is to aggressively patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.  We have a portfolio of patents and applications based on clinical and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling discoveries, and our novel formulations.  We intend to continue filing patent applications seeking intellectual property protection as we generate anticipated formulation refinements, new methods of manufacturing and clinical trial results.
 We will only be able to protect our technologies and medicines from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them.  As such, our commercial success will depend in part on receiving and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our technologies and medicines as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges.
 The patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved.  No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents has emerged to date in the United States.  The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain.  Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.  Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.  For example:
  
• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our issued patents and the issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not be successful in any patent litigation to enforce our patent rights, including our pending patent litigation regarding PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and/or VIMOVO;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or medicine candidates that are patentable; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.

 For a description of our legal proceedings related to intellectual property matters, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our medicines successfully depends in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payers, including, in the United States, government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers.  Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  This is especially true in markets where over-the-counter and generic options exist.  Even if coverage is made available by a third-party payer, the reimbursement rates paid for covered medicines might not be adequate.  For example, third-party payers may use tiered coverage and may adversely affect demand for our medicines by not covering our medicines or by placing them in a more expensive formulary tier relative to competitive medicines (where patients have to pay relatively more out of pocket than for medicines in a lower tier).  We cannot be certain that our medicines will be covered by third-party payers or that such coverage, where available, will be adequate, or that our medicines will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies.  Many states have also created preferred drug lists for use in their Medicaid programs and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate.  The industry competition to be included on such formularies and preferred drug lists often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient assistance to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other therapeutic alternative is available.  In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process.  We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any medicine to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our medicines for formulary coverage and reimbursement.  Even with studies, our medicines may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than competitive medicines, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our medicines or our medicine candidates.  These pricing and reimbursement pressures may create negative perceptions to any medicine price increases, or limit the amount we may be able to increase our medicine prices, which may adversely affect our medicine sales and results of operations.  Where coverage and reimbursement are not adequate, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such medicines, and patients may decline to purchase them.  This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our medicines and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 The U.S. market has seen a trend in which retail pharmacies have become increasingly involved in determining which prescriptions will be filled with the requested medicine or a substitute medicine, based on a number of factors, including potentially perceived medicine costs and benefits, as well as payer medicine substitution policies.  Many states have in place requirements for prescribers to indicate “dispense as written” on their prescriptions if they do not want pharmacies to make medicine substitutions; these requirements are varied and not consistent across states.  We may need to increasingly spend time and resources to ensure the prescriptions written for our medicines are filled as written, where appropriate.
 Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and medicine pricing regulation have been subject to significant change, and may change further at any time, particularly given recent political focus on the pharmaceutical industry.  Even if favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement status is attained for one or more medicines, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 23

Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, promotion, pricing, import, export, storage and distribution of medicines.  These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign regulatory agency requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, additional reporting obligations and/or agency oversight, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of medicines, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a medicine from the market. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and biologics additionally under the Public Health Service Act.  The process required by the FDA before medicine candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests and pre-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicine candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or BLA as appropriate, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the medicine candidate for the indication for use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within sixty days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, regulations for pharmaceuticals; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the medicine in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our medicine candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of pre-clinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular medicine candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.  A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during medicine development.  Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed.  The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.  Similar requirements to the U.S. IND are required in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials.
 Clinical Trials.  For purposes of NDA or BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the medicine candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the medicine for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24

 
• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the medicine is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a medicine candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the medicine after approval under a post-marketing commitment or post- marketing requirement. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a medicine. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of drug development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, as appropriate.  Applications also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information.  Applications must be accompanied by a significant user fee.  Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within twelve months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, eight months from submission.  The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.  The FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer to ensure that the medicine can be reliably produced in compliance with cGMPs and will typically inspect certain clinical trial sites for compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP.  The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.  The FDA may deny approval of an application by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.  A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data.  Approval may occur with boxed warnings on medicine labeling or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a medicine.  Once issued, the FDA may withdraw medicine approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the medicine reaches the market.  In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved medicines which have been commercialized and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a medicine based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Clinical Trials in the EU.  Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the international council for harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP.  Additional GCP guidelines from the EC, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products.  The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee.  The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation.  Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted.  Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is expected to take effect in 2020, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement.  Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP.  Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national medicines regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program.  At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.  A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure.  Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs.
 25

Orphan Medicines.  Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a medicine available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the medicine.  A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition.  If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use.  Orphan drug designation does not shorten the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a medicine with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the medicine generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances.  Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications.  If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.  Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another medicine under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent medicine with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved medicine on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
 In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a medicine can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the EC if its sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment.  For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.  Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this medicine is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.  The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Other Regulatory Requirements.  Medicines manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual medicine quality review, payment of program fees and reporting requirements.  Adverse event experience with the medicine must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA.  Our medicines may be subject to REMS requirements that affect labeling, distribution or post market reporting.  Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.  Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and untitled letters or warning letters that could cause us or our third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities.  A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines.  In addition to Form 483 notices and untitled letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of medicine, injunctive action, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, import alert or possible civil penalties.  The FDA may also require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval for that medicine. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet, including certain social media activities.  Medicines may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  Further, if there are any modifications to the medicine, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental application, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled letters, corrective advertising and potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our medicines or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. 
 Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available pharmaceuticals for uses that are not described in the medicine’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA.  Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties.  Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances.  The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments.  The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.  Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of medicines for off-label uses and other sales practices.  These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of medicines for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.  If our promotional activities, including any promotional activities that a contracted sales force may perform on our behalf, fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities.  In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved medicine from the market, require corrective advertising or a recall or institute fines or civil fines, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.  In addition, the distribution of prescription medicines is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states.  Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription medicine samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.  Further, under the Drug Quality and Security Act, drug manufacturers are subject to a number of requirements, including, medicine identification, tracing and verification, among others, that are designed to detect and remove counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise potentially harmful drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain.
 Outside the United States, the ability of our partners and us to market a medicine is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities.  The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and region to region.

The EU and the EEA consist, at the time of writing, of the twenty-seven Member States of the EU (for details on the impact the United Kingdom leaving the EU will have, see the section entitled ‘The Impact of Brexit’ below), plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein which are Member States of the EEA.  These Member States have all acceded to the single market rules governing the supervision of medicinal products.  Under the prevailing rules, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.  There are three procedures for an MA to be obtained: 
  
• | the Centralized MA, which is issued by the EC through the Centralized Procedure, based on the scientific opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU/EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as (i) biotechnology medicinal products such as genetic engineering, (ii) orphan medicinal products, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU/EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized Procedure MAs are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. An identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS, to lead the evaluation of the regulatory submission. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet as distilled from the preliminary evaluation, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the RMS records the agreement, closes the procedure and informs the applicant accordingly. Each Member State concerned by the procedure is required to adopt a national decision to grant a national MA in conformity with the approved assessment report, SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet as approved. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, the granted national MA can be used for mutual recognition in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure, or MRP, resulting in progressive national approval of the product in the EU/EEA. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by a single competent authority of the Member States of the EEA and only covers their respective territory, are also available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Once a product has been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA through the National Procedure, this National MA can also be recognized in other Member States through the MRP. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authority(ies) of the Member State(s) of the EEA prepare an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product against the scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC (each as amended), the EU has adopted a harmonized approach to data and market protection or exclusivity (known as the 8 + 2 + 1 formula).  The data exclusivity period begins to run on the date when the first MA is granted in the EU.  It confers on the MA holder of the reference medicinal product eight years of data protection and ten years of market protection.  A reference medicinal product is defined to mean a medicinal product authorized based on a full dossier consisting of pharmaceutical and pre-clinical testing results and clinical trial data, such as a medicinal product containing a new active substance.  The ten-year market protection can be extended cumulatively to a maximum period of eleven years if during the first eight years of those ten years of protection period, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. 
 The protection period means that an applicant for a generic medicinal product is not permitted to rely on pre-clinical pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical data contained in the file of the reference medicinal product of the originator until the first eight years of data protection have expired.  Thereafter, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the reference medicinal product to support approval of the generic product.  However, a generic cannot market until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product or eleven years if the protection period is extended, based on the formula of 8+2+1.
 28

In addition to the above, where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, a non-cumulative period of one year of data exclusivity shall be granted, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication.  Finally, where a change of classification of a medicinal product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-clinical tests or clinical trials, the competent authority shall not refer to the results of those tests or trials when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of marketing authorization for a change of classification of the same substance for one year after the initial change was authorized.
 The 8 + 2 + 1 exclusivity scheme applies to products that have been authorized in the EU by either the EMA through the Centralized Procedure or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA nationally, including through the Decentralized and Mutual Recognition procedures. 
 For a medicinal product which has received orphan designation under Regulation 141/2000, it will, as set out in further detail in the section entitled ‘Orphan Medicines’ above, benefit from a period of ten years of orphan market exclusivity which essentially constitutes a period of market monopoly.  During this period of orphan market exclusivity, no EU regulatory authority is permitted to accept or approve an application for marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product or an extension application for the same therapeutic indication.  This period can be extended cumulatively to a total of twelve years if the marketing authorization holder or applicant complies with the requirements for an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006.  
 The holder of a Centralized MA or National MA is subject to various obligations under the applicable EU laws, such as pharmacovigilance obligations, requiring it to, among other things, report and maintain detailed records of adverse reactions, and to submit periodic safety update reports, or PSURs, to the competent authorities.  All new marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited.  Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. The holder must also ensure that the manufacturing and batch release of its product is in compliance with the applicable requirements.  The MA holder is further obligated to ensure that the advertising and promotion of its products complies with applicable EU laws and industry code of practice as implemented in the domestic laws of the Member States of the EU/EEA.  The advertising and promotional rules are enforced nationally by the EU/EEA Member States.
 The Impact of Brexit.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) took effect on January 31, 2020.  Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom applicable to our business and our products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products in the United Kingdom and/or the EU.  
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws.  As a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business.  We may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.  For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations.  Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.  These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. 
 29

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The term “remuneration” is defined as any remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute may have been violated, and enforcement will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to state that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.  In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or to have offered improper inducements to federal health care program beneficiaries to select a particular provider or supplier.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.  Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.  In addition, where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our activities with physician customers, pharmacies, and patients, as well as our activities pursuant to partnerships with other companies and pursuant to contracts with contract research organizations, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.  In addition, the ACA specified that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.  The federal False Claims Act has been the basis for numerous enforcement actions and settlements by pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies in connection with various alleged financial relationships with customers.  In addition, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached substantial financial settlements in connection with allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws, as might violations of the federal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark laws, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to certain designated health services with which the physician or the physician’s family member has a financial interest and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to the prohibited referral.  The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery.  In addition, various states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including, without limitation, false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and laws analogous to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer, and there are also federal criminal false claims laws. 
 Separately, there are a number of other fraud and abuse laws that pharmaceutical manufacturers must be mindful of, particularly after a medicine candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States.  For example, a federal criminal law enacted as part of, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers.  The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.  There are also federal civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, as well as federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 30

Privacy and Security Laws.  We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.  Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity.  In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.  
 In the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, went into effect in 2018 and replaced Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Privacy Directive).  The GDPR applies to identified or identifiable personal data processed by automated means (for example, a computer database of customers) and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA.  Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.  The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects. Additionally, Brexit took effect in January 2020, which is also expected to lead to further legislative and regulatory changes.  While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that “implements” and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households (including health information).  The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. It is unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
 “Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws.  There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information.  Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, and make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices.  In addition, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report to the federal government the following: certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, teaching hospitals and, in 2021, other healthcare professionals including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives; and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  The federal government began disclosing the reported information on a publicly available website in 2014.  Certain states, such as Massachusetts, also make the reported information publicly available.  In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations.  These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our medicines in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.  If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.  In the EU/EEA, declaration of transfers of value to healthcare professionals is subject to the requirements under the voluntary industry code of practice.  France however has a statutory regime similar to the U.S. Sunshine Act.
 31

Government Price Reporting.  For those marketed medicines which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require medicines be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program).  We are also required to discount such medicines to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply.  These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear.  Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.  One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the extent that a branded drug’s price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers).  This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer.  This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increase have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny.  Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the EU through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers.  Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed.  To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies.  Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits.  The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense.  As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
 In General.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities in the United States could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.  Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements.  If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the state or federal laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  To the extent that any medicine we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.  Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.  Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign privacy, security, sunshine, government price reporting, and fraud laws may prove costly.
Impact of Healthcare Reform and Recent Public Scrutiny of Drug Pricing on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing.  In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our medicines, federal and state lawmakers and regulatory authorities as well as third-party payers are increasingly attempting to regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative medicines and therapies, which has resulted in delays of coverage decisions, barriers for product access including higher patient copays and in certain cases, leads to lower average net selling prices.  Further, there is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities.  In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country-specific and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU, both of which will put additional pressure on medicine pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future medicine sales and results of operations.  These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 32

The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our medicines profitably.  Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs (including a number of proposals pertaining to prescription drugs, specifically), improving quality and/or expanding access.  In the United States, some of the additional proposals to reduce the cost of prescription drug prices considered at the federal level include directing Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers for the costliest drugs; various Medicare Part D and Medicaid reforms; price reporting transparency; importation rulemaking; an international pricing index proposal to require additional discounts to Medicare, as well as a proposal requiring manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if the price of a Medicare Part B or Part D drug increases more than the rate of inflation.  Also at the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2020 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients.  For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final regulation that would require Part D plans to include drug pricing information and lower cost therapeutic alternatives as well as allow “step therapy” in Medicare Advantage for Part B drugs.  While these final measures will require additional rulemaking and action by Congress to pass legislation to become effective, these provisions reinforce the administration’s focus on controlling drug prices.  At the state level, in Massachusetts, the MassHealth program has requested permission from the federal government to use commercial tools, such as a closed formulary, to negotiate more favorable rebate agreements from drug manufacturers.  There also has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices in recent years, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods.  There have been several recent state and federal lawmaker inquiries, proposed legislation and enacted legislation as was the case in California designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, by requiring drug companies to notify insurers and government regulators of price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for the increase.  There have also been actions to review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the ACA.  The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.  It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business.  Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA.  These challenges include Executive Orders directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA, to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices as well as legislation passed by the House of Representatives and Senate, but not yet signed into law, to repeal certain aspects of the ACA.  On October 12, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed another Executive Order directing certain federal agencies (including HHS) to propose regulations or guidelines, such regulations that HHS finalized by HHS in 2019 to permit small businesses to form association health plans, expand the availability of short-term, limited duration insurance, and expand the use of health reimbursement arrangements, which may circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA.  In addition, citing legal guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until such appropriations are made.  The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA.  Finally, while Congress has not passed comprehensive ACA repeal or replace legislation, the federal income tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”.  We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and additional actions by Congress to possibly repeal and replace it has on our business.

Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted.  For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.  Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.  In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of medicines, including our medicine candidates.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans (also known as the Medicare “Donut Hole”), and also increases in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent under current law to 70 percent.  The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our medicines.
Irish Law Matters
 As we are an Irish-incorporated company, the following matters of Irish law are relevant to the holders of our ordinary shares. 
 Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital.  Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions imposed specifically on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies.  Dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.  The Financial Transfers Act 1992 gives power to the Minister for Finance of Ireland to restrict financial transfers between Ireland and other countries and persons.  Financial transfers are broadly defined and include all transfers that would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the member states of the EU.  The acquisition or disposal of interests in shares issued by an Irish incorporated company and associated payments falls within this definition.  In addition, dividends or payments on redemption or purchase of shares and payments on a liquidation of an Irish incorporated company would fall within this definition.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) also gives the Minister of Finance of Ireland the power to take various measures, including the freezing or seizure of assets, in order to combat terrorism.  At present the Financial Transfers Act 1992, certain EU regulations (as implemented into Irish law) and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) prohibit financial transfers involving certain persons and entities associated with the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida organizations, the late Slobodan Milosevic and associated persons, Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Myanmar/Burma, Belarus, certain persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the late Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida, the Taliban of Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iran, Iraq, Côte d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Liberia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Republic of Guinea, Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ukraine, Yemen, Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain known terrorists and terrorist groups, and countries that harbor certain terrorist groups, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland or the Minister of Finance (as applicable). 
 Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or EU sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law. 
 Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders 
 Withholding Tax on Dividends.  While we have no current plans to pay dividends, dividends on our ordinary shares would generally be subject to Irish Dividend Withholding Tax, or DWT, at the rate of 25 percent, unless an exemption applies. 
 Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held beneficially through the Depositary Trust Company, or DTC, will not be subject to DWT provided that the address of the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares in the records of the broker is in the United States. 
 34

Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held directly (outside of DTC) will not be subject to DWT provided that the shareholder has completed the appropriate Irish DWT form and this form remains valid.  Such shareholders must provide the appropriate Irish DWT form to our transfer agent at least seven business days before the record date for the first dividend payment to which they are entitled. 
 If any shareholder who is resident in the United States receives a dividend subject to DWT, he or she should generally be able to make an application for a refund from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on the prescribed form (DWT Claim Form 1).
 While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding tax, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions. 
   Income Tax on Dividends.  A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us unless that shareholder holds our ordinary shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on. 
 A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is not entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us.  The DWT deducted by us discharges the liability to Irish income tax and to the universal social charge.  This however is not the case where the shareholder holds the ordinary shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on. 
 Irish Tax on Capital Gains.  A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and does not hold our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholder in Ireland through a branch or agency should not be within the charge to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of our ordinary shares. 
 Capital Acquisitions Tax.  Irish capital acquisitions tax, or CAT, is composed principally of gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties.  This is because our ordinary shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland as our share register must be held in Ireland.  The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. 
 CAT is levied at a rate of 33 percent above certain tax-free thresholds.  The appropriate tax-free threshold is dependent upon (i) the relationship between the donor and the donee and (ii) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same category of relationship for CAT purposes.  Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT.  Our shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to whether CAT is creditable or deductible in computing any domestic tax liabilities. 
 Stamp Duty.  Irish stamp duty (if any) may become payable in respect of ordinary share transfers.  However, a transfer of our ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired shares through DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.  A transfer of our ordinary shares (i) by a seller who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC to any buyer, or (ii) by a seller who holds the ordinary shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired ordinary shares outside of DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1 percent of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares acquired, if greater).  The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the buyer or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or for less than market value, all parties to the transfer. 
 35

A shareholder who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC may transfer those ordinary shares into DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer into DTC there is no sale of those book-entry interests to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  Similarly, a shareholder who holds ordinary shares through DTC may transfer those ordinary shares out of DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer, and at the time of the transfer out of DTC there is no sale of those ordinary shares to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  In order for the share registrar to be satisfied as to the application of this Irish stamp duty treatment where relevant, the shareholder must confirm to us that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) (or vice-versa) as a result of the transfer and there is no agreement for the sale of the related book-entry interest or the ordinary shares or an interest in the ordinary shares, as the case may be, by the shareholder to a third party being contemplated.
