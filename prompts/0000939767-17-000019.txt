ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Exelixis, Inc. (“Exelixis,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer. Since its founding in 1994, three products discovered at Exelixis have progressed through clinical development, received regulatory approval, and entered the commercial marketplace. Two are derived from cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL, and VEGF receptors: CABOMETYX™ tablets approved for previously treated advanced kidney cancer and COMETRIQ® capsules approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. The third product, Cotellic®, is a formulation of cobimetinib, a selective inhibitor of MEK, marketed under a collaboration with Genentech (a member of the Roche Group), and is approved as part of a combination regimen to treat advanced melanoma. Both cabozantinib and cobimetinib have shown potential in a variety of forms of cancer and are the subjects of broad clinical development programs. 
The following is a summary of important information about our internally-discovered, marketed products:

• | CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 25, 2016, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The European Commission, or EC, approved CABOMETYX on September 9, 2016 similarly for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, targeted therapy. Outside the U.S. and Japan, CABOMETYX is being marketed by our collaboration partner Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen. Should CABOMETYX be approved in Japan, it will be marketed by our collaboration partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. In 2016, we generated $93.5 million in net product revenue from sales of CABOMETYX in the United States.


• | COMETRIQ (cabozantinib), our first marketed product, was approved by the FDA on November 29, 2012 for the treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma, or MTC. In March 2014, the EC granted COMETRIQ a similar, conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. COMETRIQ is now commercialized in the European Union by Ipsen. In 2016, we generated $39.4 million in net product revenue from sales of COMETRIQ in the United States and received $2.5 million in product revenue from sales of COMETRIQ by our former distribution partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, or Sobi. Cabozantinib has shown clinical anti-tumor activity in more than 20 forms of

cancer, so we are focused on advancing the broad cabozantinib clinical development program in order to advance commercial opportunities beyond advanced RCC and MTC. For additional information, see “Cabozantinib Development Program.”

• | Cotellic (cobimetinib) was approved by the FDA on November 10, 2015, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the United States. It has also been approved in combination with vemurafenib in multiple other territories including the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Brazil. In 2016, we recognized $2.8 million in collaboration revenue as a result of royalties on ex-U.S. sales of Cotellic and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we also recognized a small net profit for our share of U.S. activities under the collaboration agreement. Genentech has an extensive clinical development program for this compound. For additional information on the cobimetinib development program, see “Cobimetinib Development Program.”

 Our immediate business objective is to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of CABOMETYX, COMETRIQ and Cotellic. Over the course of 2016, the revenue generated from the sale of these products and from our collaboration agreements, coupled with disciplined expense management and reduced debt on our balance sheet, has created a capital structure upon which we believe Exelixis can grow in a sustainable manner. As a result, we believe we are increasingly well positioned to drive the expansion and depth of our product offerings through the continued development of cabozantinib, the measured resumption of internal drug discovery activities and the evaluation of in-licensing and acquisition opportunities that align with our oncology drug development expertise.
Recent Developments
Commercialization of CABOMETYX for Advanced RCC
The American Cancer Society’s 2016 statistics cite kidney cancer as among the ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the United States. The second and later-line RCC market is large and growing; published studies suggest that the drug-eligible patient population encompasses approximately 17,000 individuals in the United States and 37,000 globally. 
When the FDA approved our novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, CABOMETYX, in April 2016, we were prepared to engage with the advanced RCC treating community and bring CABOMETYX to market for the benefit of patients. Experienced and professional oncology sales, marketing, market access, and medical affairs teams were in place and our supply chain and distribution arrangements were substantially complete. Our educational efforts began to familiarize physicians with CABOMETYX’s unique product profile, although physicians were already largely familiar with the TKI class. 
CABOMETYX is distinct from other approved treatment options for previously treated patients with advanced RCC because it is the first single agent therapy to demonstrate robust and clinically meaningful improvements in all three key efficacy parameters - overall survival, or OS, progression-free survival, or PFS, and objective response rate, or ORR - in that indication. The FDA recognized this during its regulatory review, when it granted CABOMETYX Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations. For additional information about METEOR (Metastatic RCC Phase 3 Study Evaluating Cabozantinib vs. Everolimus), the phase 3 pivotal trial upon which the approval of CABOMETYX was based, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Exelixis Sponsored Trials - RCC - METEOR.”
A review of the launch to date shows that physicians are rapidly adopting CABOMETYX, demonstrated by increasing demand and patients initiating therapy, despite the large number of competing products approved to treat advanced RCC. The clinical profile and initial success of CABOMETYX in the United States has enabled us to continue to attract top talent and further build commercial and medical affairs organizations of considerable size and experience. As a result, we believe that we are well positioned to support the growth of our development pipeline.
In Europe, Ipsen has made significant progress since September 2016, when the EC approved CABOMETYX tablets for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior VEGF targeted therapy. By the end of 2016, Ipsen recorded its first commercial sales in Europe and is now preparing to potentially market CABOMETYX in all 28 member states of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and elsewhere.

Establishment and Expansion of Global Partnerships for Cabozantinib
On February 29, 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen, a specialty pharmaceutical company already engaged in the global distribution of oncology medicines. Our collaboration focuses on the further development of cabozantinib and provides Ipsen exclusive rights to commercialize current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. On December 20, 2016, we agreed to add Canada to the Ipsen territories because Ipsen also has substantial business resources in that country. The upfront payments and regulatory milestones we received from Ipsen during 2016 were essential to our commercial success because they provided us with the financial resources to successfully commercialize CABOMETYX in the United States without having to access alternative sources of capital. For additional information on our collaboration with Ipsen, see “Collaborations - Cabozantinib Collaborations - Ipsen Collaboration.”
On January 30, 2017, we continued to advance the global development and commercialization of cabozantinib by entering into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for currently developed and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan. The parties have also agreed to collaborate on the future clinical development of cabozantinib. For additional information on our collaboration with Takeda, see “Collaborations - Cabozantinib Collaborations - Takeda Collaboration.”
Submission Planning for Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for Cabozantinib as a Treatment for First-Line Advanced RCC
On May 23, 2016, we announced that CABOSUN, a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC being conducted by The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, or The Alliance, as part of our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or NCI-CTEP, met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with sunitinib in patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. Based on these results, we are working towards the submission of a sNDA in 2017 for cabozantinib as a treatment for first-line advanced RCC. For additional information on the results of CABOSUN, see “Cabozantinib Development Program - Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program - RCC - CABOSUN.”
Expanded Development and Commercialization of Cotellic
During 2016, our collaboration partner, Genentech, received additional approvals for Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E mutation in multiple countries, including Australia and Brazil. Genentech also advanced the development program for cobimetinib during 2016, through the initiation and announcement of multiple phase 3 pivotal trials exploring the combination of cobimetinib with other targeted and immuno-oncology agents for the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer, or CRC. Cobimetinib has the potential to provide us with a meaningful second significant source of revenue. For additional information on the cobimetinib development program, see “Cobimetinib Development Program.”
Extinguishment of Convertible Debt
During 2016, we retired our 4.25% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes. This was accomplished by first entering into privately negotiated exchange transactions pursuant to which $239.4 million of the 2019 Notes were exchanged for an aggregate of approximately 45 million shares of our common stock and an aggregate cash payment of approximately $2.4 million. Following completion of these exchange transactions, we issued a redemption notice for the remaining $48.1 million of the outstanding 2019 Notes. As a result of the redemption, $47.5 million of the 2019 Notes were converted into shares of our common stock and the remaining $0.6 million of the 2019 Notes were redeemed in cash for 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the end of the redemption period. As a result of the successful completion of the exchange transactions and redemption of the 2019 Notes, we significantly reduced our outstanding debt and strengthened our capital structure to support potential future growth. For additional information on the exchange transactions and redemption of the 2019 Notes, see “Note 7, Debt,” to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Evaluation of Cabozantinib in Combination with Immune-oncology Agents in Various Indications, Including a Phase 3 Trial in First Line Advanced RCC
Cabozantinib has demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent in advanced RCC, and we are interested in further examining its potential in combination with immunotherapies to treat this serious disease. Building on the available preclinical and clinical observations that suggest treatment with cabozantinib results in a more immune-permissive tumor environment potentially resulting in cooperative activity of cabozantinib in combination with immune check point inhibitors, in collaboration with Bristol Meyers Squibb Company, or BMS, we intend to evaluate the combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab in various tumor types, including bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, and a phase 3 trial in first-line advanced RCC. The combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab is being evaluated in a phase 1b trial that has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and clinical activity in patients with heavily pre-treated genitourinary malignancies, as reported at the European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2016 Congress and, more recently at the 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Additionally, we are planning to initiate a phase 1b trial with various expansion cohorts evaluating cabozantinib and atezolizumab, Roche’s PD-L1 targeting antibody, in patients with advanced genitorurinary malignancies, including RCC and bladder cancer. For additional information on our clinical collaboration agreements with BMS and Roche, see “Cabozantinib Development Program.”
Resumption of Discovery Activities
We have recently resumed internal drug discovery efforts with the goal of identifying novel and promising therapeutic candidates to advance into clinical trials. From 2000 until 2012, we had an active Discovery group that advanced 22 compounds to Investigational New Drug, or IND stage, either independently or with collaboration partners, including cabozantinib and cobimetinib. We built a significant infrastructure, including a library of 4.6 million compounds, and gained extensive experience in the identification and optimization of drug candidates against multiple target classes for oncology, inflammation and metabolic diseases.
Our new discovery organization will leverage that history, but will be more focused and measured. We intend to concentrate our in-house work on the most sensitive and demanding aspects of lead optimization and use contract research organizations, or CROs, to support more routine activities, thereby minimizing our internal footprint while still maintaining an agile, competitive approach. We intend to be judicious in the selection of targets and focus on those with the most robust preclinical validation datasets. We anticipate that our experience and ability to identify high quality lead compounds through use of our propriety compound library will permit us to prosecute competitive and productive discovery programs in areas of high potential.
Cabozantinib Development Program
Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Objective tumor responses have been observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in more than 20 individual tumor types investigated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to date, reflecting the medicine’s broad clinical potential. We are currently evaluating cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 ongoing or planned clinical trials across multiple indications. We are the sponsor of some of those trials, including CELESTIAL (Cabozantinib Phase 3 Controlled Study In Hepatocellular Carcinoma), our phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with advanced HCC who had received previous treatment with sorafenib, with the remaining trials being conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP or our investigator sponsored trial, or IST program. Beginning in February 2017, we also entered into individual clinical collaboration agreements with BMS and Roche, for the purpose of conducting clinical studies combining cabozantinib with BMS’s PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors and Roche’s anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy compound.

Exelixis Sponsored Trials
MTC - EXAM
COMETRIQ’s safety and efficacy were assessed in an international, multi-center, randomized double-blinded controlled trial of 330 patients with progressive, metastatic MTC, known as EXAM (Efficacy of XL184 (Cabozantinib) in Advanced Medullary Thyroid Cancer). Patients were required to have evidence of progressive disease within 14 months prior to study entry. This assessment was performed by an independent radiology review committee, or IRRC, in 89% of patients and by the treating physicians in 11% of patients. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive COMETRIQ 140 mg (n = 219) or placebo (n = 111) orally, once daily until disease progression determined by the treating physician or until intolerable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years) and prior use of a TKI. No cross-over was allowed at the time of progression. The primary endpoint was to compare PFS in patients receiving COMETRIQ versus patients receiving placebo. Secondary endpoints included ORR and OS. The main efficacy outcome measures of PFS, ORR and response duration were based on IRRC-confirmed events using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, which is a widely used set of rules that defines when cancer patients improve (“respond”), stay the same (“stabilize”) or worsen (“progress”) during treatments.
EXAM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of COMETRIQ in the United States and European Union. A statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated among COMETRIQ-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo [HR 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19-0.40); p<0.0001], with median PFS of 11.2 months in the COMETRIQ arm and 4.0 months in the placebo arm. Partial responses, or PRs, were observed only among patients in the COMETRIQ arm (27% vs. 0%; p<0.0001). The median duration of objective response was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1-19.3) for patients treated with COMETRIQ. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 25% of patients were diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, or PPES, decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation. In November 2014, we announced completion of the OS analysis, the secondary endpoint of the study. Consistent with an earlier interim analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the treatment arms. The median OS was 26.6 months for the COMETRIQ arm and 21.1 months for the placebo arm (HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.64-1.12; p = 0.2409). The subgroup analysis by RET M918T mutation status, a known negative prognostic factor in MTC, revealed a large improvement in OS of 25.4 months for COMETRIQ-treated patients positive for the RET M918T mutation; the median OS was 44.3 months for the COMETRIQ arm and 18.9 months for the placebo arm (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.95; p = 0.026, not adjusted for multiple subgroup testing). We presented the final results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2015 Annual Meeting and submitted the results to regulatory authorities to satisfy post-marketing commitments.
In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, all of which have been satisfied, other than a requirement to conduct a clinical study comparing a lower dose of COMETRIQ with the labeled dose of 140 mg. This study is evaluating safety and PFS in progressive, metastatic MTC patients and is ongoing.
RCC - METEOR
In July 2015, we announced positive results of METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing CABOMETYX to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor inhibitor. METEOR was initiated in May 2013. The trial was designed to enroll 650 patients at approximately 200 sites. Patients were stratified based on the number of prior VEGF receptor inhibitors received, and on commonly applied RCC risk criteria. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg of CABOMETYX daily or 10 mg of everolimus daily and no cross-over was allowed between the study arms. The METEOR trial was designed to provide adequate power to assess both the primary endpoint of PFS, and the secondary endpoint of OS. The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis of PFS would be conducted among the first 375 patients randomized while the secondary endpoint of OS would be conducted among all 650 patients randomized. This design was employed to ensure sufficient follow-up and a PFS profile that would not be primarily weighted toward early events. Such disproportionate weighting of events was a potential risk if the entire study population required for the secondary endpoint analysis of OS had also served as the population for the primary analysis of PFS. On September 26, 2015, The New England Journal of Medicine published the complete, detailed positive results from the primary analysis of METEOR, and these results were also presented during the Presidential Session I at the European Cancer Congress 2015. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in PFS for CABOMETYX, as determined by an IRRC among the first 375 patients enrolled. The median PFS was 7.4 months for the CABOMETYX arm versus 3.8 months for the everolimus arm, and the hazard ratio [HR] was 
7

0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.75, p<001), corresponding to a 42% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death for CABOMETYX compared to everolimus. The trial also showed that CABOMETYX significantly improved the ORR. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 25% of patients were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, PPES, hypertension, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation.
A review of adverse events, or AEs, demonstrated that the frequency of AEs of any grade regardless of causality was approximately balanced between study arms, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 9% and 10% for CABOMETYX and everolimus, respectively. With additional follow-up for OS, the study also met its secondary endpoint of OS as presented in June 2016 at the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting and published in Lancet Oncology. Compared with everolimus, CABOMETYX was associated with a 34% reduction in the rate of death and median OS was 21.4 months for patients receiving CABOMETYX versus 16.5 months for those receiving everolimus (HR=0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.83, P=0.0003). 
In January 2016, an analysis of PFS among all 658 patients enrolled was presented at the 2016 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, and revealed consistent results with the primary analysis showing a median PFS of 7.4 months for the CABOMETYX arm versus 3.9 months for the everolimus arm, and a HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.43-0.64, p<0.001), corresponding to a 48% reduction in the rate of disease progression or death for CABOMETYX as compared to everolimus. In addition, subgroup analyses for PFS showed consistent beneficial effect of CABOMETYX versus everolimus; subgroups included: ECOG performance status; commonly applied RCC risk groups as described by Motzer et al.; organ involvement, including bone and visceral metastases and overall tumor burden; extent and type of prior VEGF receptor inhibitor therapy; and prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. For patients without prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, median PFS was 7.4 months for CABOMETYX and 3.9 months for everolimus (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.44-0.66). For patients who had received prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, the median PFS for CABOMETYX was not reached, and the median PFS for everolimus was 4.1 months (HR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.65). Subgroup analyses for ORR also showed consistent benefit for CABOMETYX as compared to everolimus.
On the basis of the data from the METEOR trial, CABOMETYX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC following prior antiangiogenic therapy, and by the EC for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior VEGF targeted therapy.
HCC - CELESTIAL
Published studies indicate that an estimated 700,000 new cases of HCC present each year worldwide, with 39,000 of these cases in the United States. While patients with localized disease may be candidates for surgery or other therapies such as embolization, treatment options for advanced disease are limited. Currently, sorafenib is the only approved agent for the first line treatment of advanced, unresectable HCC. However, patients typically progress despite sorafenib treatment, at which point there is no approved therapy available to them. While a number of VEGF receptor targeting agents have been tested in phase 2/3 trials in the post-sorafenib setting, only one phase 3 trial has shown positive results. In 2016 results from a study comparing regorafenib and placebo in the second line treatment of HCC has reported positive results and data are currently under review by regulatory agencies. Thus, second-line advanced HCC still represents an area of substantial unmet medical need.
MET is the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, and plays a crucial role in liver development and regeneration. Expression of MET is elevated in HCC, particularly in metastatic HCC, and high MET levels are associated with reduced OS and resistance to sorafenib treatment. In preclinical models, upregulation of MET has been shown to drive escape from VEGF receptor inhibition, and to promote an increase in invasion and metastasis. Consistent with this, treatment of HCC patients with sorafenib can result in increases in tumor MET expression. These findings provide a strong parallel with the RCC setting, where high levels of MET expression and activation are also associated with poor prognosis and resistance to and escape from first-line treatment with VEGF receptor inhibitors.
We believe that targeting both MET and VEGF receptors with cabozantinib in HCC may provide benefit in second-line HCC by maintaining VEGF receptor inhibition while also inhibiting MET-driven oncogenic and resistance pathways. In an initial test of this hypothesis, a cohort of HCC patients, including a subset whose disease had progressed despite prior sorafenib treatment, was enrolled in our phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial. Based on the encouraging data that emerged from this trial, we launched CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with advanced HCC who had received previous treatment with sorafenib. The trial is designed to enroll 760 patients at up to 200 sites. Patients are being randomized 2:1 to receive 60 mg of cabozantinib daily or placebo. The primary endpoint for CELESTIAL is OS, and the secondary endpoints include ORR and PFS. In September 2016, following the first planned 
8

interim analysis for CELESTIAL, the trial’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, determined that the study should continue without modifications per the study protocol. We anticipate top-line results from CELESTIAL in 2017.
Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements
Bladder Cancer, HCC and First-Line Advanced RCC - Combination Studies with BMS
Building on the available preclinical and clinical observations that cabozantinib results in a more immune-permissive tumor environment potentially resulting in cooperative activity of cabozantinib in combination with immune check point inhibitors, in February 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab or cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab in various tumor types, including, in a planned phase 3 trial in first-line advanced RCC, and in potential additional trials in bladder cancer and HCC. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, each party will grant to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (within the collaboration territory as defined in the collaboration agreement), non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other party’s compounds in the conduct of each clinical trial. The parties’ efforts will be governed through a joint development committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation. Each trial will be conducted under a combination IND application, unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority. Each party will be responsible for supplying drug product for the applicable clinical trial and costs for each such trial will be shared equally between the parties, unless two BMS compounds will be utilized in such trial, in which case BMS will bear two-thirds of the costs for such study treatment arms and we will bear one-third of the costs. Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement shall remain in effect until the completion of all clinical trials under the collaboration, all related trial data has been delivered to both parties and the completion of any then agreed upon analysis. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. Upon termination by either party, the licenses granted to each party to conduct a combined therapy trial will terminate.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors - Combination Study with Roche
We are also planning to initiate a phase 1b dose escalation study that will evaluate the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with Roche’s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Based on the dose-escalation results, the trial has the potential to enroll up to four expansion cohorts, including a cohort of patients with previously untreated advanced clear cell RCC and three cohorts of urothelial carcinoma, namely platinum eligible first-line patients, first or second-line platinum ineligible patients and patients previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Enrollment for this trial is scheduled to begin mid-year 2017. We will be the sponsor of the trial, and Roche will provide atezolizumab.
Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program
In October 2011, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-CTEP for the clinical development of cabozantinib. Through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program we have been able to expand the cabozantinib development program dramatically while avoiding over-burdening our internal development resources. Our CRADA reflects a major commitment by NCI-CTEP to support the broad exploration of cabozantinib’s potential in a wide variety of cancers, each representing a substantial unmet medical need. Through this mechanism, NCI-CTEP provides funding for as many as 20 active clinical trials of cabozantinib each year for a five-year period. The term of the CRADA was extended in October 2016 for an additional five-year period through October 2021, provided, that both parties maintain the right to terminate the CRADA for any reason upon sixty days’ notice, an uncured material breach upon thirty days’ notice and immediately for safety concerns. IND applications for trials under the CRADA are held by NCI-CTEP. NCI-CTEP also retains rights to any inventions made in whole or in part by NCI-CTEP investigators. However, for inventions that claim the use and/or the composition of cabozantinib, we have an automatic option to elect a worldwide, non-exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions for commercial purposes, with the right to sublicense to affiliates or collaborators working on our behalf, as well as an additional, separate option to negotiate an exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions. Further, before any trial proposed under the CRADA may commence, the protocol is subject to our review and approval, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. We believe our CRADA with NCI-CTEP has and will enable us to continue to expand the cabozantinib development program broadly in a cost-efficient manner.

RCC - CABOSUN
In October 2016, we announced detailed results from CABOSUN, a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease conducted by The Alliance under our CRADA with NCI-CTEP. CABOSUN was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial that enrolled 157 patients with advanced RCC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive cabozantinib (60 mg once daily) or sunitinib (50 mg once daily, 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off). The primary endpoint was PFS. Secondary endpoints included OS and ORR. Eligible patients were required to have locally advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC, ECOG performance status 0-2, and had to be intermediate or poor risk per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or IMDC, criteria (Heng, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2009). 
CABOSUN met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with sunitinib. With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, cabozantinib demonstrated a 34 percent reduction in the rate of disease progression or death [HR 0.66, 95% CI (0.46-0.95), one-sided P=0.012]. The median PFS for cabozantinib was 8.2 months versus 5.6 months for sunitinib, corresponding to a 2.6 months (46 percent) improvement favoring cabozantinib over sunitinib. PFS benefits were independent of the IMDC risk group (intermediate or poor risk) and presence or absence of bone metastases at baseline. The results for sunitinib were in line with a previously published retrospective analysis of 1,174 intermediate- and poor-risk RCC patients from the IMDC database, which documented a median PFS of 5.6 months with a first-line targeted therapy, mainly sunitinib, in this patient population. ORR was also significantly improved, at 46 percent (95% CI 34% - 57%) for cabozantinib versus 18 percent (95% CI 10% to 28%) for sunitinib. With a median follow-up of 22.8 months, median OS was 30.3 months for cabozantinib versus 21.8 months for sunitinib [HR 0.80, 95% CI (0.50 - 1.26)]. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events with cabozantinib were hypertension (28%), diarrhea (10%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (8%), and fatigue (6%); with sunitinib, they were hypertension (22%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (11%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Grade 5 adverse events occurred in four patients (5%) in the cabozantinib group and five patients (7%) in the sunitinib group. Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in three patients in the cabozantinib group (acute kidney injury, sepsis, and jejunal perforation) and three patients in the sunitinib group (sepsis, respiratory failure, and vascular disorders). The rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was 20% (n = 16) and 21% (n = 16) in the cabozantinib and sunitinib groups, respectively. 
Based on these results, we plan to submit a sNDA for cabozantinib as a treatment of first-line advanced RCC, and are working with The Alliance so that we can develop the appropriate regulatory filings.
Advanced Genitourinary Tumors
Results from a phase 1 trial of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors being conducted under our CRADA with NCI-CTEP were first presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress in October 2016 and recently updated at the 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2017. 
Between July 22, 2015 and December 31, 2016, 48 patients were accrued with previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, or mUC, (n=19), urachal adenocarcinoma (n=4), squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder or urethra (n=2), germ cell tumor (n=4), castration-resistant prostate cancer (n=9), RCC (n=4), trophoblastic tumor (n=1), sertoli cell tumor (n=1) or penile squamous cell carcinoma (n=4) and treated in two parts. In Part I, 30 patients were treated with the doublet combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab at four dose levels. In Part II, 18 patients were treated with the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab at three dose levels.
Among the 43 patients who were evaluable for response, the ORR for all tumor types was 30% (38% for the doublet dosing schedule and 18% for the triplet dosing schedule) with a 7% complete response, or CR, rate and a 23% PR rate. Stable disease, or SD, was reported in 56% of patients. The ORR for patients with mUC was 38%, and 2 of 16 patients achieved a CR, while 2 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder had objective responses (1 CR and 1 PR). In the mUC cohort, 15 of 16 patients had a CR, PR or SD as their best response.
Grade 3 adverse events (>5% of patients) observed in the doublet combination included neutropenia (17%), hypophosphatemia (13%), hypertension (10%), lipase increase (7%), fatigue (7%), diarrhea (7%) and dehydration (7%). Grade 3 adverse events (>5% of patients) observed in the triplet combination included hypertension (17%), hypophosphatemia (17%), fatigue (13%), hyponatremia (13%), lipase increase (13%), nausea (13%) and rash (6%). There were limited numbers of grade 4 adverse events (10% including thrombocytopenia and lipase increase in the doublet combination, and 6% (lipase increase) in the triplet combination), and no grade 5 adverse events observed in either part of the trial.
10

The recommended doses for the ongoing expansion cohorts were determined to be cabozantinib 40 mg daily plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for the doublet and cabozantinib 40 mg daily, nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the triplet.
We believe these promising early stage clinical findings support further investigation of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors in a number of genitourinary tumors.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
In November 2014, we announced positive top-line results from a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib and erlotinib alone or in combination as second- or third-line therapy in patients with stage IV EGFR wild-type NSCLC. This trial (Study E1512) was sponsored through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and was conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. It enrolled 125 patients with EGFR wild-type metastatic NSCLC who had received at least one or two prior chemotherapy regimens; of these, 111 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 118 patients were evaluable for safety. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive erlotinib (150 mg daily), cabozantinib (60 mg daily), or the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib (150 mg plus 40 mg daily).
The positive results from this trial were reported at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting on May 31, 2015, and subsequently published online in Lancet Oncology on November 4, 2016. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating significant increases in PFS for cabozantinib and the combination of cabozantinib plus erlotinib when individually compared to the erlotinib arm. The median PFS for the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib was 4.7 months versus 1.8 months for erlotinib alone, a more than two-fold increase. The HR was 0.37 (80% CI 0.25-0.53, p=0.0003), which corresponds to a 63% reduction in the rate of disease worsening. The median PFS for cabozantinib monotherapy was 4.3 months versus 1.8 months for erlotinib alone, and the HR was 0.39 (80% CI 0.27-0.55, p=0.0003), corresponding to a 61% reduction in the rate of disease worsening. OS was a secondary endpoint of the trial. Median OS was 13.3 months for the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib, and 9.2 months for cabozantinib alone, as compared to 5.1 months for erlotinib alone. When individually compared to the erlotinib arm, HR for OS was 0.51 (p=0.011), corresponding to a 49% reduction in the rate of death for the combination of cabozantinib plus erlotinib, and 0.68 (p=0.071), corresponding to a 32% reduction in the rate of death for the cabozantinib monotherapy arm. ORR, another secondary endpoint, was 3% for the combination arm (1 PR), 11% (4 PRs) for the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, and 3% (1 PR) for the erlotinib arm. SD as a best response was observed in 46% of patients in the combination arm and 50% in the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, compared with 16% in the erlotinib arm. One hundred and nineteen patients were evaluable for safety. The most common treatment-related adverse events, or AEs, grade 3 or higher, for the combination arm (n=39) were: diarrhea (28%), fatigue (15%), and anorexia (8%). For the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, the most common AEs, grade 3 or higher, were: hypertension (25%), fatigue (15%), mucositis (10%), diarrhea (8%), and thromboembolic events (8%). The most common AEs, grade 3 or higher, for the erlotinib arm were fatigue (13%) and diarrhea (8%). Overall, the rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 72% in the combination arm, 70% in the cabozantinib monotherapy arm, and 33% in the erlotinib arm.
Informed by these clinical results, we are working with clinical collaborators to explore cabozantinib’s further development in NSCLC, including potential combination approaches with immuno-oncology agents.
Other Cancer Indications
Other clinical trials approved to date under the CRADA include the following:

• | Phase 2 or phase 1/2 clinical trials to help prioritize future pivotal trials of cabozantinib in disease settings where there is substantial unmet medical need and in which cabozantinib has previously demonstrated clinical activity, consisting of randomized phase 2 clinical trials in ocular melanoma, prostate cancer and second/third line EGFR-wt NSCLC;


• | Additional phase 2 or phase 1/2 clinical trials to explore cabozantinib’s potential utility in other tumor types, including endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, sarcomas, NSCLC (EGFR-activating mutation positive), differentiated thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, cutaneous melanoma (molecularly selected patients), pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors. Positive results in these indications could lead to further study in randomized phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials; and


• | Additional phase 1 clinical trials to further evaluate cabozantinib, consisting of a combination trial of cabozantinib and immuno-oncology agents (nivolumab with or without ipilumumab) in genitourinary tumors,

11

a trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in pediatric patients, and a trial of cabozantinib in patients with advanced solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus.
In addition to supporting the further development of cabozantinib, our medical affairs department receives and responds to unsolicited physician inquiries with appropriate scientific and medical information, supports scientific presentations and publications, and oversees the IST process. Like our CRADA with NCI-CTEP, our IST program helps us to continue to evaluate cabozantinib across a broad range of tumor types, including NSCLC, bladder cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer and others, to support further prioritization of our clinical and commercial options. Currently there are 25 active IST or CTEP trials and 16 trials are in advanced planning stage.
Cobimetinib Development Program
In addition to the advances made under our cabozantinib development program, significant progress continues to be made with respect to the clinical development, regulatory status and commercial potential of cobimetinib. Cobimetinib is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of MEK, a kinase that is a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This pathway mediates signaling downstream of growth factor receptors, and is prominently activated in a wide variety of human tumors.  Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program by Genentech.
A select summary of Genentech’s ongoing cobimetinib development activities, all of which are sponsored by Roche/Genentech, is provided below:

Indication | Combination Regimen | Status Update 
Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Melanoma
BRAF mutation-positive | + vemurafenib | Approved in US, EU and other territories
First-line BRAF mutation-positive | + atezolizumab + vemurafenib | Phase 3 (IMspire150 TRILOGY) 
First-line BRAF wild-type | + atezolizumab | Phase 3 (IMspire170) planned for 2017 
Colorectal Cancer 
Third-line advanced or metastatic disease | + atezolizumab | Phase 3 (IMblaze370) 
Second/third-line metastatic disease | + atezolizumab + bevacizumab | Phase 1 
Breast Cancer 
First-line metastatic triple negative disease | + taxane +/- atezolizumab | Phase 1/2 (COLET) 

Melanoma - coBRIM
In July 2014, we announced positive top-line results from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial conducted by Genentech evaluating cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Data were subsequently presented at European Society for Medical Oncology in September 2014. The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in investigator-determined PFS. The median PFS was 9.9 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 6.2 months for vemurafenib alone (HR=0.51, 95 percent CI 0.39-0.68; p<0.0001), demonstrating the combination reduced the risk of the disease worsening by half (49 percent). The median PFS as established by an IRRC, a secondary endpoint, was 11.3 months for the combination arm compared to 6.0 months for the control arm (HR=0.60, 95 percent CI 0.45-0.79; p=0.0003). ORR, another secondary endpoint, was 68% for the combination versus 45% for vemurafenib alone (p<0.0001). Updated results for PFS and ORR from coBRIM were presented at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting and showed a median PFS of 12.3 months for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus 7.2 months for vemurafenib alone (HR=0.58, 95 percent CI 0.46-0.72) and an ORR of 70% for the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus 50% for vemurafenib alone. In November 2015, we announced that the coBRIM trial also met its OS secondary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in OS for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib compared to vemurafenib monotherapy. The median OS was 22.3 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 17.4 months for vemurafenib alone, corresponding to a 30% reduction in the rate of death for the combination as compared to vemurafenib alone (HR=0.70, 95 percent CI 0.55-0.90, p= 0.005). The safety profile of the 
12

combination was consistent with that observed in a previous study. The most common adverse drug reactions for COTELLIC occurring in at least 20% of patients were diarrhea, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.
CoBRIM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of Cotellic in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the United States, Switzerland, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries.
CRC - IMblaze370
In June 2016, Genentech initiated IMblaze370, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, or atezolizumab alone versus regorafenib, in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC patients who have received at least two lines of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. IMblaze370 was informed by results from Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial of the same combination in advanced CRC.
The trial is designed to enroll 360 patients who have received at least two prior chemotherapies in the metastatic disease setting. The primary endpoint of the trial is OS.
Melanoma - IMspire150 TRILOGY and IMspire170
In January 2017, Genentech initiated IMspire150 TRILOGY, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib, vemurafenib and atezolizumab vs. cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation positive patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. This trial was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. The trial is designed to enroll 500 patients, and the primary endpoint is PFS. 
Genentech has also plans to initiate IMspire170, a phase 3 trial comparing cobimetinib plus atezolizumab to pembrolizumab in previously untreated BRAF WT patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma in the second quarter of 2017. IMspire170 was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. The trial is designed to enroll 500 patients with primary endpoints of PFS and OS. 
Other Cancer Indications
In addition to coBRIM, IMblaze370 and TRILOGY, additional clinical trials are ongoing studying the combination of cobimetinib with a variety of agents in multiple tumor types. These include:

• | The combination of cobimetinib and vemuarfenib in additional melanoma patient populations and settings;


• | A phase 2 trial of cobimetinib in combination with taxanes, with or without atezolizumab in first line triple negative breast cancer (COLET);


• | Phase 1 studies of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in melanoma and NSCLC, in combination with vemurafenib and atezolizumab in melanoma, and in combination with venetoclax in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia; and


• | A phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic CRC.

A complete listing of all ongoing cobimetinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
XL888
XL888 is an Exelixis-discovered highly potent small molecule oral inhibitor of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone protein that affects the activity and stability of a range of key regulatory proteins, including kinases such as BRAF, MET and VEGFR2, which are implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival. After completing phase 1 testing of the compound, we deprioritized XL888 and our other pipeline assets to focus our limited resources on our lead compound, cabozantinib. Investigators at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center went on to conduct additional preclinical work showing activity of XL888 in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, the results of which provided the rationale for the initiation of an investigator-sponsored phase 1 trial conducted by investigators at the Moffitt Cancer Center.
In November 2014, we announced positive preliminary results from this phase 1 trial, which evaluated the safety and activity of XL888 in combination with vemurafenib in patients with unresectable stage III/IV BRAF V600 mutation-
13

positive melanoma. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination, including determination of a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for XL888. Secondary endpoints included ORR (RECIST-1 criteria), estimates of PFS and OS, and analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The trial had enrolled fifteen subjects, and at the time of data cut-off, objective tumor regression was observed in 11 of 12 response-evaluable patients (two CRs and nine PRs), for an ORR of 92%. Safety data for the combination identified tolerable dose levels of XL888 with full dose vemurafenib.
Based on these results, as well as findings from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial of cobimetinib, an Exelixis-discovered MEK inhibitor, and vemurafenib in previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, investigators at the Moffitt Cancer Center initiated a phase 1b IST of the triple combination of vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and XL888 in a similar patient population during the second quarter of 2016.
Collaborations
We have established collaborations with Ipsen and Takeda for cabozantinib, Genentech for cobimetinib, and other collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies including, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada), BMS, and Sanofi for compounds and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our collaborations, we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or, in the case of cobimetinib, a share of profits (or losses) from commercialization.
Cabozantinib Collaborations
Ipsen Collaboration
In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the United States, Canada and Japan. The collaboration agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016 to include commercialization rights in Canada. We have also agreed to collaborate with Ipsen on the development of cabozantinib for current and potential future indications. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint steering committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction; provided, however, that we retain final decision-making authority with respect to cabozantinib’s ongoing development. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, Ipsen paid us an upfront payment of $200.0 million in March 2016. Additionally, as a result of the amendment to the collaboration agreement, we received a $10.0 million upfront payment from Ipsen in December 2016. As a result of the approval of cabozantinib in second-line RCC by the EC in September 2016, we received a $60.0 million milestone payment in November 2016. We are also eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments, totaling up to $254.0 million, including, milestone payments of $10.0 million and $40.0 million upon the filing and the approval of cabozantinib in second-line HCC with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and additional milestone payments for other future indications and/or jurisdictions. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we earned two $10.0 million milestone payments for the first commercial sales of CABOMETYX in Germany and the United Kingdom. The collaboration agreement also provides that we will be eligible to receive contingent payments of up to $544.7 million associated with the achievement of specified levels of Ipsen sales to end users. We will also receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib outside of the United States and Japan. We will receive a 2% royalty on the initial $50.0 million of net sales, and a 12% royalty on the next $100.0 million of net sales. After the initial $150.0 million of sales, we will receive a tiered royalty of 22% to 26% on annual net sales; these tiers will reset each calendar year. We are primarily responsible for funding cabozantinib related development costs for existing trials; global development costs for potential future trials are shared between the parties, provided Ipsen opts in to participate in such trials, with Ipsen to reimburse us for 35% of such costs. Ipsen has opted to participate in and co-fund in accordance with our collaboration agreement the future first line RCC phase 3 study evaluating cabozantinib in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and ipilimumab that we are planning in collaboration with BMS, as well as the phase 1b trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in genitorurinary malignancies that we are planning to initiate mid-year. We remain responsible for the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. As part of the collaboration agreement, we entered into a supply agreement that provides that through the end of the second quarter of 2018, we will supply finished, labeled product to Ipsen for distribution in the territories outside of the United States and Japan. From the end of the second quarter of 2018 forward, we will continue to manufacture cabozantinib tablets and capsules while Ipsen will be responsible for packaging and labeling the products in territories where they have been approved outside of the United States and Japan, as applicable.
14

Unless terminated earlier, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latter of (i) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib or (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib, other than COMETRIQ. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Ipsen challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. Ipsen may terminate the collaboration agreement if the FDA or EMA orders or requires substantially all cabozantinib clinical trials to be terminated or if the EMA refuses to approve our marketing authorization application, or MAA, for cabozantinib in advanced RCC in such region. Ipsen also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on a region-by-region basis after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in advanced RCC in the given region. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Ipsen will automatically terminate, and, except in the event of a termination by Ipsen for our material breach, the licenses granted by Ipsen to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide, or, if Ipsen terminated only for a particular region, then for the terminated region. Following termination by us for Ipsen’s material breach, or termination by Ipsen without cause or because we undergo a change of control by a party engaged in a competing program, Ipsen is prohibited from competing with us for a period of time.
Takeda Collaboration
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda for the commercialization and further clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for currently developed and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan. The parties have also agreed to collaborate on the future clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint executive committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction.
In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront payment from Takeda in February 2017. We are eligible to receive development, regulatory and first-sales milestone payments of up to $95.0 million related to second-line RCC, first-line RCC and second-line HCC, as well as additional development, regulatory and first-sales milestones payments for potential future indications. The collaboration agreement also provides that we are eligible to receive pre-specified payments of up to $83.0 million associated with potential sales milestones. We will also receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan at an initial tiered rate of 15% to 24% on net sales for the first $300.0 million of cumulative net sales. Thereafter, the royalty rate will be adjusted to 20% to 30% on annual net sales.
Takeda is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with the global cabozantinib development plan, provided Takeda opts in to participate in such trials, and 100% of costs associated with the cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, we remain responsible for the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration. As part of the collaboration, the parties intend to enter into a supply agreement covering the manufacture and supply of cabozantinib to Takeda and a quality agreement setting forth in detail the quality assurance arrangements and procedures for our manufacture of cabozantinib.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the earlier of (i) two years after first generic entry with respect to such product in Japan or (ii) the later of (A) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib and (B) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib in Japan. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. For clarity, Takeda’s failure to achieve specified levels of commercial performance, based upon sales volume and/or promotional effort, during the first six years of the collaboration shall constitute a material breach of the collaboration agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Takeda challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. At any time prior to August 1, 2023, the parties may mutually agree to terminate the collaboration agreement if Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency is unlikely to grant approval of the MAA in any cancer indication in Japan. After the commercial launch of cabozantinib in Japan, Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement upon twelve months’ prior written notice following the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in Japan. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Takeda will automatically terminate, and the licenses granted by Takeda to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide.

Cobimetinib Collaboration 
In December 2006, we out-licensed the development and commercialization of cobimetinib to Genentech pursuant to a worldwide collaboration agreement. Genentech paid upfront and milestone payments of $25.0 million in December 2006 and $15.0 million in January 2007 upon signing of the collaboration agreement and with the submission of the IND application for cobimetinib. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we were responsible for developing cobimetinib through the determination of the maximum-tolerated dose, or MTD in a phase 1 clinical trial, and Genentech had the option to co-develop cobimetinib, which Genentech could exercise after receipt of certain phase 1 data from us. In March 2008, Genentech exercised its option to co-develop cobimetinib, triggering a payment to us of $3.0 million. In March 2009, we granted to Genentech an exclusive worldwide revenue-bearing license to cobimetinib, at which point Genentech became responsible for completing the phase 1 clinical trial and subsequent clinical development. We received an additional $7.0 million payment in March 2010 and are not eligible for any additional milestone payments.
Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Genentech for cobimetinib, we are entitled to a share of U.S. profits and losses received in connection with commercialization of cobimetinib. The profit share has multiple tiers: we are entitled to 50% of profits and losses from the first $200.0 million of U.S. actual sales, decreasing to 30% of profits and losses from U.S. actual sales in excess of $400.0 million. In addition, we are entitled to low double-digit royalties on ex-U.S. net sales. In November 2013, we exercised an option under the collaboration agreement to co-promote in the U.S. The FDA approved cobimetinib in the U.S. under the brand name Cotellic on November 10, 2015. Cotellic is indicated in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma. Following FDA approval of Cotellic in November 2015, we began fielding 25% of that product sales force. Cotellic in combination with Zelboraf has also been approved in Switzerland, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Brazil and multiple additional countries for use in the same indication. 
We believe that cobimetinib has the potential to provide us with a second significant source of revenue. Our objective, therefore, is and has been to work with Genentech on the execution of the U.S. Cotellic commercial plan in order to maximize the product’s revenue potential. However, we believe Genentech’s pricing of, and cost and revenue allocations for, Cotellic, as determined exclusively by Genentech, have been contrary to the applicable terms of the collaboration agreement. We raised this concern with Genentech, along with other material concerns regarding Genentech’s performance under the collaboration agreement, but were unable to come to resolution on any of these issues. Accordingly, on June 3, 2016, following a 30 day dispute resolution period, we filed a demand for arbitration asserting claims against Genentech related to its clinical development, pricing and commercialization of Cotellic, and cost and revenue allocations in connection with Cotellic’s commercialization in the United States. On July 13, 2016, Genentech asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking monetary damages and interest related to the cost allocations under the collaboration agreement. On December 29, 2016, Genentech withdrew its counterclaim against us and stated that it would unilaterally change its approach to allocation of promotional expenses arising from commercialization of the Cotellic plus Zelboraf combination therapy, both retrospectively and prospectively. We believe this revised allocation approach substantially reduced our exposure to costs associated with promotion of the Cotellic plus Zelboraf combination in the United States. Notwithstanding Genentech’s change of approach, other significant issues remain in dispute between the parties. Genentech’s action does not address the claims in our demand for arbitration related to Genentech’s clinical development of cobimetinib, or pricing and promotional costs for Cotellic in the United States, nor does it fully resolve claims over revenue allocation. And, Genentech has not clarified how it intends to allocate promotional costs incurred with respect to the promotion of other combination therapies that include cobimetinib for other indications that will be developed or are in development and may be approved. As a result, we will continue to press our position for the arbitral panel to obtain a just resolution of these claims. The ultimate outcome of the arbitration is difficult to predict.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues until the expiration of the last payment obligation with respect to the licensed products under the collaboration. Genentech has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement without cause at any time. If Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, all licenses that were granted to Genentech under the agreement terminate and revert to us. Additionally, if Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, or we terminate the collaboration agreement for cause, we would receive, subject to certain conditions, licenses from Genentech to research, develop and commercialize reverted product candidates. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party.
Other Collaborations
Prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, our primary business strategy was focused on the development and out-license of compounds to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaboration agreements 
16

that allowed us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products. Our collaboration agreements with Daiichi Sankyo, Merck, BMS and Sanofi are representative of this historical strategy. We have since evolved and are now a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on maximizing the clinical and commercial potential of CABOMETYX, COMETRIQ and Cotellic. While our historical collaboration agreements described below have the potential to provide meaningful future revenue in the aggregate, we do not expect to receive substantial revenues from these historical collaboration agreements unless and until our partnered compounds enter late-stage clinical development and/or receive marketing approval from the FDA, if ever, when the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits under our historical collaboration agreements become more substantial and material to our business.
With respect to our partnered compounds, other than cabozantinib and cobimetinib, we are eligible to receive potential contingent payments totaling approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate on a non-risk adjusted basis, of which 9% are related to clinical development milestones, 42% are related to regulatory milestones and 49% are related to commercial milestones, all to be achieved by the various collaborators, which may not be paid, if at all, until certain conditions are met. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of our other partnered compounds that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. In addition, most of the collaborations for our other partnered compounds are at early stages of development. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator’s business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of a partnered compound. As such, the remaining potential contingent payments associated with our historical collaboration agreements involve a substantial degree of risk to achieve and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential contingent payments described above and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant milestone or other payments under these historical collaboration agreements.
Daiichi Sankyo
In March 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against the mineralocorticoid receptor, or MR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate MR, including CS-3150/esaxerenone (a specific rotational isomer of XL550). Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for all further preclinical and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the compounds and we do not have rights to reacquire such compounds, except as described below.
During the research term, which concluded in November 2007, we jointly identified drug candidates with Daiichi Sankyo for further development. For each product from the collaboration, we are entitled to receive payments upon attainment of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. To date, we have received an aggregate of $25.5 million in development milestone payments related to CS-3150, an oral, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, including a $15.0 million milestone payment in October 2016 in connection with the initiation of a phase 3 pivotal trial to evaluate CS-3150 as a treatment for essential hypertension in Japanese patients. We are eligible to receive additional development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments of up to $130.0 million. In addition, we are also entitled to receive royalties on any sales of certain products commercialized under the collaboration. Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement upon ninety days’ written notice in which case Daiichi Sankyo’s payment obligations would cease, its license relating to compounds that modulate MR would terminate and revert to us and we would receive, subject to certain terms and conditions, licenses from Daiichi Sankyo to research, develop and commercialize compounds that were discovered under the collaboration.
Merck
In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Merck pursuant to which we granted Merck an exclusive worldwide license to our phosphoinositide-3 kinase-delta, or PI3K-d, program, including XL499 and other related compounds. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Merck has sole responsibility to research, develop, and commercialize compounds from our PI3K-d program. In July 2015 we received a $3.0 million milestone payment from Merck in connection with Merck’s selection of a compound from our PI3K-d program to advance into clinical trials and in April 2016, we received a milestone payment of $5.0 million in connection with the initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial for the compound. We will be eligible to receive additional payments associated with the successful achievement of potential development and regulatory 
17

milestones for multiple indications of up to $231.0 million. We will also be eligible to receive payments for combined sales performance milestones of up to $375.0 million and royalties on net-sales of products emerging from the agreement. 
Merck may at any time, upon specified prior notice to us, terminate the license. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination by Merck at will or by us for Merck’s uncured material breach, the license granted to Merck would terminate. In the event of a termination by us for Merck’s uncured material breach, we would receive a royalty-free license from Merck to develop and commercialize certain joint products. In the event of termination by Merck for our uncured material breach, Merck would retain the licenses from us, and we would receive reduced royalties from Merck on commercial sales of products.
Bristol-Myers Squibb - ROR Collaboration Agreement
In October 2010, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with BMS pursuant to which each party granted to the other certain intellectual property licenses to enable the parties to discover, optimize and characterize ROR antagonists that may subsequently be developed and commercialized by BMS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we were responsible for activities related to the discovery, optimization and characterization of the ROR antagonists during the collaborative research period which began on October 8, 2010 and ended on July 8, 2013. Since the end of the collaborative research period, BMS has and will continue to have sole responsibility for any further research, development, manufacture and commercialization of products developed under the collaboration and will bear all costs and expenses associated with those activities. 
For each product developed by BMS under the collaboration, we will be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement by BMS of development and regulatory milestones. In February 2017, we received a $2.5 million development milestone payment in connection with the achievement of certain preclinical milestones set forth in the collaboration agreement. We are eligible for additional development and regulatory milestone payment of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate and commercialization milestones of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate, as well as royalties on commercial sales of any such products.
The collaboration agreement was amended and restated in April 2011 in connection with an assignment of patents to a wholly-owned subsidiary. BMS may, at any time, terminate the collaboration agreement upon certain prior notice to us on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination by BMS at will or by us for BMS’s uncured material breach, the license granted to BMS would terminate, the right to such product would revert to us and we would receive a royalty-bearing license for late-stage reverted compounds and a royalty-free license for early-stage reverted compounds from BMS to develop and commercialize such product in the related country. In the event of termination by BMS for our uncured material breach, BMS would retain the right to such product, subject to continued payment of milestones and royalties.
Bristol-Myers Squibb - LXR Collaboration
In December 2005, we entered into a collaboration agreement with BMS for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against LXR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The collaboration agreement became effective in January 2006, at which time we granted BMS an exclusive worldwide license with respect to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate LXR, including BMS-852927 (XL041). During the research term, we jointly identified drug candidates with BMS that were ready for IND-enabling studies. After the selection of a drug candidate for further clinical development by BMS, BMS agreed to be solely responsible for further preclinical development as well as clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and sales/marketing activities for the selected drug candidate. We do not have rights to reacquire the drug candidates selected by BMS. The research term expired in January 2010 and we transferred the technology to BMS in 2011 to enable it to continue the LXR program. BMS has terminated development of XL041 and we have been advised that BMS is continuing additional preclinical research on the program. The collaboration agreement was amended and restated in April 2011 in connection with an assignment of patents to a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Under the collaboration agreement, BMS is required to pay us contingent amounts associated with development and regulatory milestones of up to $53.0 million per product for up to two products from the collaboration. In addition, we are also entitled to receive payments associated with sales milestones of up to $310.0 million and royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the collaboration.
18

Sanofi
In May 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with Sanofi for SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765), leading inhibitors of phosphoinositide-3 kinase, or PI3K, and a broad collaboration for the discovery of inhibitors of PI3K for the treatment of cancer. The license agreement and collaboration agreement became effective on July 7, 2009. Under the license agreement, Sanofi received a worldwide exclusive license to SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765), which entered into a series of phase 1, phase 1b/2 or phase 2 clinical trials, and has sole responsibility, including funding, for all subsequent clinical, regulatory, commercial and manufacturing activities. We were notified by Sanofi that the initial clinical trials involving XL147 or XL765 have been terminated or are in the process of concluding, and that Sanofi is still considering whether to initiate any further trials. We will be eligible to receive contingent payments associated with development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the license agreement of $745.0 million in the aggregate, as well as royalties on sales of any products commercialized under the license. Sanofi may, upon certain prior notice to us, terminate the license as to products containing SAR245408 (XL147) and SAR245409 (XL765). In the event of such termination election, Sanofi’s license relating to such product would terminate and revert to us, and we would receive, subject to certain terms, conditions and potential payment obligations, licenses from Sanofi to research, develop and commercialize such products.
In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi pursuant to which the parties terminated the discovery collaboration agreement and released each other from any potential liabilities arising under the collaboration agreement prior to effectiveness of the termination in December 2011. Each party retains ownership of the intellectual property that it generated under the collaboration agreement, and we granted Sanofi covenants not-to-enforce with respect to certain of our intellectual property rights. If either party or its affiliate or licensee develops and commercializes a therapeutic product containing an isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor that arose from such party’s work (or was derived from such work) under the collaboration agreement, then such party will be obligated to pay royalties to the other party based upon the net sales of such products. The termination agreement provides that Sanofi will make a one-time payment to us upon the first receipt by Sanofi or its affiliate or licensee of marketing approval for the first therapeutic product containing an isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor that arose from Sanofi’s work (or was derived from such work) under the collaboration agreement.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, who, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We have selected well-established and reputable global CMOs for our drug substance and drug product manufacturing that have good regulatory standing, large manufacturing capacities, and multiple manufacturing sites within their business footprint. We also have contracted with a third party logistics provider, with two distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the United States. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our CMOs. Our quality department audits these suppliers on a periodic basis. Our commercial suppliers are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. We work closely with our third party manufacturers to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies in other territories, as applicable. 
We source raw materials that are used to manufacture our drug substance from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe. We stock sufficient quantities of these materials and provide them to our third party drug substance contract manufacturers to ensure they can manufacture adequate drug substance quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We store drug substance at third party facilities, and provide appropriate amounts to our third party drug product contract manufacturers who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for COMETRIQ and CABOMETYX, respectively. Our third-party contract manufacturers also need to obtain materials such as excipients, components and reagents to manufacture our drug substance and finished drug products. 
Within our supply chain, we have established safety stock amounts for both our drug substance and drug products, and store these quantities in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for market demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our drug substance and drug products. In parallel, for business continuity reasons, we are in the process of evaluating and expect to establish additional suppliers for our drug substance and drug product manufacturers in the near future. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of CABOMETYX to 
19

support the current approved indication of advanced RCC, as well as potential indications of first-line RCC and second line HCC, if those indications prove to be successful and gain regulatory approval in the future. 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the United States, and we co-promote Cotellic in association with Genentech. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products and concentrate our efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists. While we have expanded our U.S. distribution and pharmacy channels in connection with the approval of CABOMETYX by the FDA, we still rely on a relatively limited distribution network to dispense COMETRIQ in fulfillment of prescriptions in the United States. Furthermore, we rely on Ipsen and Takeda for the commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in territories outside of the United States, as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under our named patient use, or NPU, program. We also rely on Genentech, as our collaboration partner for Cotellic, for all commercialization and marketing activities, with the exception of the limited co-promotion activities highlighted above.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the United States have appropriate access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and support program called Exelixis Access Services, or EASE. Through EASE, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, EASE is designed to provide comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support, benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support. 
Seasonal Operations and Backlog
Sales of our marketed products do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs. We do not believe that backlog information is material to our business as a whole.
Environment, Health and Safety
In support of the development and expansion of our product pipeline, we have resumed discovery activities. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. While we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations, we do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, export, import, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products.
20

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;


• | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;


• | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to FDA for commercial marketing, or of a sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;


• | if FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and


• | FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and provide its informed consent form before the trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1 - Studies, which involve the initial introduction of an IND into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or patients.


• | Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to run what is referred to as a “phase 2b” evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory phase 2 trial that could, if positive, serve as a pivotal trial in the approval of a product candidate.


• | Phase 3 - When phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, phase 3 trials are performed to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide replicate statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s adverse drug reaction reporting system. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or as part of an sNDA. The submission of an NDA or sNDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee, the agency usually does so. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or sNDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or sNDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. An NDA may be approved with significant restrictions on its labeling, marketing and 
21

distribution under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, including restricting the promotion of uses for which a drug is not approved by the agency. Not only must a company have appropriate substantiation to support claims made about a drug, under the FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications for which FDA has approved the drug and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.
In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, is intended to incentivize the development of drugs and biological products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. (or that affects more than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.). If a drug is being developed for a rare disease of condition, to be eligible for designation as an orphan drug, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug” for the same orphan indication. If the FDA has previously approved another same drug for the same indication, to obtain orphan drug designation, the sponsor of the subsequent drug would be required to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug to obtain an orphan designation. Upon FDA receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 50% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for grant funding, and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for the approved orphan-designated indication. Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break a previously approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
22

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that treat serious conditions and that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of NDA filing as compared to a standard review time of 10 months from NDA filing. Certain other types of drug applications are also eligible for priority review. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs, the FDA also designates Breakthrough Therapy status to drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.
Additional programs intended to expedite the development of drug products were included in the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. Signed into law on December 13, 2016, the Cures Act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments, such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may bring to the FDA to support drug approval, to encourage patient-centered drug development, to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information, or HCEI, to payers, and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs, including provisions that:

• | require the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements;


• | provide that the FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug;


• | require FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs; and


• | require FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for or investigational use of a drug.

As to dissemination of HCEI, the Cures Act amends Section 114 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to help clarify and facilitate the dissemination of HCEI, including by broadening the definition of HCEI, expressly extending the dissemination of HCEI to payors, and clarifying that HCEI must only “relate” to an FDA-approved indication rather than “directly” relate to the indication.
The Hatch-Waxman Act 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, established two approval pathways for drug products in which potential competitors may rely upon the FDA’s prior approval of the same or similar drug product.
ANDA. An abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, may be approved by the FDA if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved drug, which is referred to as the “reference listed drug,” or RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are 
23

intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. Furthermore, conducting bioequivalence testing is generally less time consuming and costly than conducting a full set of clinical trials in humans.
505(b)(2) NDAs. A 505(b)(2) application is one for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, an applicant may rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. If the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies. The FDA may require additional studies or measurements, including comparability studies.
Unlike a full NDA for which the sponsor has conducted or obtained a right of reference to all the data essential to approval, the filing of both an ANDA application and a 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for the first approval of a new chemical entity, and three years of data exclusivity for supplemental applications containing clinical studies essential to the approval of the sNDA.
Orange Book Listing. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. Filing such a lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired.
Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit MAAs either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use reviews the application and issues an opinion on it. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for deciding applications. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, or the EEA. The national authorization procedures, the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national applications, are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the European Union member states selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another member state, referred to as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any member state. Under this procedure the applicant can select the member state that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the member states where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States or CMS. Within 
24

90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each CMS must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment. If a member state does not agree with the assessment, and the disputed points cannot be resolved the matter is eventually referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states. If the application is successful national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the member states chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in European Union law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, such as the completion of ongoing or new studies and obligations relating to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be amongst the conditions stipulated in the marketing authorization. 
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an Orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the European Union orphan designation is available for products in development which are either: (a) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or (b) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the Community and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for orphan drug designation must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
Orphan drugs in the European Union enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Healthcare Regulation 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third‑party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and between countries in the European Union and countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy 
25

protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. Subject to the application in the European Union of the Transparency Directive 89/105/EEC, which aims to ensure the transparency of measures adopted to control pricing and reimbursement, pricing and reimbursement in the EU/EEA is governed by national rules and policy and may vary from Member State to Member State.
Reimbursement 
Sales of our approved products and any future products of ours will depend, in part, on the extent to which their costs will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients may be less likely to use our products if coverage is not provided and reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, a third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our products, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country-specific and national pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing coverage and/or reimbursement controls and measures, could have a material adverse impact on our net product revenues and results of operations.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering proposals or have enacted legislative and regulatory changes the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. There has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. There have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the PPACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a 
26

budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of PPACA that are repealed. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could have a negative impact on our revenue or sales of any products or future approved products.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products, including our approved products and any future approved products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare system. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, European Union member states may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in countries in the European Union do not follow the price structures of the United States and they generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
Competition 
There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer. Our competitors and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may allow them to have a competitive advantage.
 Competition for Cabozantinib
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:

• | efficacy, safety and reliability of cabozantinib;


• | timing and scope of regulatory approval;


• | the speed at which we develop cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types beyond its approved indications;


• | our ability to complete preclinical testing and clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib;


• | our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of cabozantinib product to the market;


• | our ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement in approved indications;


• | product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;

27


• | the level of our collaboration partners’ investments in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize cabozantinib in territories where it is approved outside of the United States;


• | skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;


• | protection of our intellectual property; and


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.

We believe that the quality and breadth of activity observed with cabozantinib, the skill of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and drug development are competitive strengths. However, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do, more substantial capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
The markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib are highly competitive. We are aware of products in research or development by our competitors that are intended to treat all of the tumor types we are targeting, and should they demonstrate suitable clinical evidence, any of these products may compete with cabozantinib. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances and the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy. Our products may become less marketable if we are unable to successfully adapt our development strategy to address the likelihood that this new approach to treating cancer with immuno-oncoloy agents will become prevalent in indications for which our products are approved, most notably advanced RCC, and in additional indications where we may seek regulatory approval.
CABOMETYX: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC includes: BMS’s nivolumab and ipilimumab; Pfizer’s axitinib, sunitinib and temsirolimus; Novartis’ everolimus and pazopanib; Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) sorafenib; Genentech’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. The competition we currently face from BMS’s nivolumab is particularly significant. Nivolumab was approved for the treatment of advanced RCC on November 23, 2015, following a rapid review by the FDA. That approval was based in large part on the results of BMS’s phase 3 trial comparing nivolumab to everolimus in patients who had received previous antiangiogenic therapy for advanced RCC (Checkmate 025), in which nivolumab met its primary endpoint of showing a statistically-significant improvement in OS over everolimus, a current standard of care for the treatment of second line RCC patients. Nivolumab failed to demonstrate a statistically-significant PFS benefit over everolimus. Nivolumab also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Additionally, there are a variety of combination therapies being developed for RCC, including, Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab, BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib, Pfizer’s avelumab and axitinib, and Merck’s pembrolizumab and Roche’s bevacizumab.
COMETRIQ: We believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is Genzyme’s RET, VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EC for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. In addition, we believe that COMETRIQ also faces competition as a treatment for progressive, metastatic MTC from off-label use of Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, Pfizer’s multikinase inhibitor sunitinib, Ariad Pharmaceutical’s multikinase inhibitor ponatinib, Novartis’ multikinase inhibitor pazopanib, and Eisai’s multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib.
Potential Cabozantinib Indications Beyond RCC and MTC: Should cabozantinib be approved for the treatment of HCC, we believe its principal competition may include Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ sorafenib, Bayer’s regorafenib, Eisai’s lenvatinib, BMS’s nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Lilly’s ramucirumab. In particular, Bayer recently announced positive results from a Phase 3 trial that compared regorafenib to placebo in the same HCC patient population that is being enrolled in our Phase 3 trial. Examples of potential competition for cabozantinib in other cancer indications include: other VEGF pathway inhibitors, including Genentech’s bevacizumab; other RET inhibitors including Eisai’s lenvatinib and Ariad’s ponatinib; and other MET inhibitors, including Amgen’s AMG 208, Pfizer’s crizotinib, ArQule’s tivantinib, and Mirati’s glesatinib; and immunotherapies such as BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Roche’s atezolizumab.
Competition for Cobimetinib
We believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition amongst targeted agents includes Novartis’ trametinib and dabrafenib, and Array’s encorafenib and binimetinib; and within the class of immunotherapies, BMS’s ipilimumab and 
28

nivolumab and Merck’s pembrolizumab. The second category, immunotherapies, are of particular competitive importance vis-a-vis cobimetinib in advanced melanoma as they are already FDA approved in melanoma patient populations that overlap with those that may be eligible for cobimetinib, they have been rapidly incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines, and they are viewed with a high degree of enthusiasm by physicians and key opinion leaders. Ongoing and future trials incorporating immuno-oncology agents, including combination trials, may further impact usage of cobimetinib in melanoma and potentially in additional tumor types in which cobimetinib may ultimately gain approval.
Financial Information and Significant Customers
We operate as a single business segment and have operations solely in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 33% of our revenues from Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy, which is located in the United States and 17% of our revenues in connection with our collaboration with Ipsen which is located in the European Union. Information regarding total revenues, including geographic regions in which they are earned, net loss and total assets for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in “Note 14. Concentrations of Credit Risk” in our “Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Research and development expenses were $96.0 million or the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additional information about our research and development expenses in each of the last three fiscal years is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek patent protection in the United States, the European Union, and selected other foreign countries to cover our drug candidates and related technologies. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have numerous patents and pending patent applications that relate to methods of screening drug targets, compounds that modulate drug targets, as well as methods of making and using such compounds.
While many patent applications have been filed relating to the drug candidates that we have developed, the majority of these are not yet issued or allowed.
Cabozantinib is covered by six issued patents in the United States, including U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,473, for the composition-of-matter of cabozantinib and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,473 would normally expire in September 2024, but we have been granted a patent term extension to extend the term to August 2026. The additional issued U.S. patents will expire between 2024 and 2032. We own the rights to the six issued U.S. patents. Cabozantinib is also covered by an issued patent in Europe (covering cabozantinib’s composition-of-matter and certain methods of use) and an issued patent in Japan (covering cabozantinib composition-of-matter). These issued patents would normally expire in September 2024, but we have applied for Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe to extend the term to 2029. We intend to apply for patent term extension in Japan to extend the term to 2029. Foreign counterparts of the issued United States and European patents are issued in Australia and Canada, which are anticipated to expire in 2024. We have patent applications pending in the United States, the European Union, Australia, Japan and Canada covering certain synthetic methods related to making cabozantinib, which, if issued, are anticipated to expire in 2024. We have filed patent applications in the United States and other selected countries covering certain salts, polymorphs and formulations of cabozantinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2030. We have filed several patent applications in the United States and other selected countries relating to combinations of cabozantinib with certain other anti-cancer agents that, if issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2030.
Cobimetinib is covered by three issued patents in the United States, including U.S. Pat. No 7,803,839 for the composition of matter of cobimetinib and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. U.S. Pat. No 7,803,839 would normally expire in February 2027, but we have applied for a patent term extension to extend the term to November 2029. We own the rights to the three issued patents. Cobimetinib is also covered an issued patent in Europe (covering cobimetinib’s composition-of-matter and certain methods of use), which would normally expire in October 2026, but we have applied for Supplementary Protection Certificates to extend the term to November 2030. Foreign counterparts of the issued United States and European patents are issued or pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Georgia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Ukraine. We have filed patent applications in the United States and other selected countries covering 
29

certain salts and polymorphs of cobimetinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2036. We have filed patent applications in the United States and other selected countries covering certain synthetic methods related to making cobimetinib, which if, issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2033. Cobimetinib is licensed to Genentech in the United States and to Roche outside of the United States.
We have pending patent applications in the United States and European Union covering the composition-of-matter of our other drug candidates in clinical or preclinical development that, if issued, are anticipated to expire between 2023 and 2030.
We have obtained licenses from various parties that give us rights to technologies that we deem to be necessary or desirable for our research and development. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) may require us to pay royalties as well as upfront and milestone payments.
