Item 1. Business
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Horizon Therapeutics plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Overview
 We are a global biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. Our pipeline is purposeful: we apply scientific expertise and courage to bring clinically meaningful therapies to patients. We believe science and compassion must work together to transform lives.
 We substantially completed the previously announced wind down of our former inflammation business in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, management realigned our reportable segments to reflect changes in the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses financial information for decision-making purposes. We transitioned our two reportable segments, the inflammation segment and the orphan segment, to one reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to our current reporting structure. Refer to Note 11, Segment and Other Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details.
 On December 12, 2022, we announced that we had entered into a transaction agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, and Pillartree Limited, or Pillartree, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. The transaction agreement provides for the acquisition of Horizon by Pillartree subject to the terms and conditions of the transaction agreement. We have agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the transaction agreement and the effective time of the transaction. Outside of certain limited exceptions, we may not take, authorize, commit, resolve, or agree to do certain actions without Amgen’s consent, including: (i) acquiring businesses and disposing of significant assets; (ii) incurring capital expenditures above specified thresholds; (iii) issuing equity; (iv) incurring indebtedness; and (v) repurchasing outstanding ordinary shares. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from being able to fund our operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements. The following discussions assume that the transaction is not consummated and we continue to operate as an independent entity. For further information, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Strategy
 Horizon is a leading high-growth, innovation-driven, profitable global biotechnology company. We are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of medicines that address critical needs for people impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. Our three strategic goals are to: (i) maximize the value of our on-market rare disease medicines through commercial execution and clinical investment; (ii) expand our research and development, or R&D, pipeline through significant internal investment and external business development; and (iii) build a global presence in targeted international markets. Our vision is to build healthier communities, urgently and responsibly, supported by our philosophy to make a meaningful difference for patients and communities in need. We believe this generates value for our multiple stakeholders, including our shareholders.
 We have made tremendous progress since our beginnings as a public company in 2011, when we had two on-market medicines and total net sales of $6.9 million. With 2022 total net sales of $3.6 billion, we now have a portfolio of 12 on-market medicines with three key growth drivers, a growing pipeline of more than 20 programs and a strong financial position that gives us the capacity to support future pipeline expansion opportunities.
 We have achieved our transformation into an innovation-driven global biotechnology company through our strong strategic execution and by leveraging the three elements we believe set Horizon apart: (i) our excellence in commercial execution; (ii) our proven and disciplined business development strategy; and (iii) our strong clinical development capability. Our excellence in commercial execution has accelerated our growth trajectory and allowed us to pursue maximizing the potential of our medicines. Through our strong in-house business development capability, we acquire and license medicines focused on opportunities for which we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive value. We leverage our deep collective drug development experience and agile approach to continually explore new ways for patients to benefit from our existing medicines and develop new medicines.

 Impact of COVID-19
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our operations and net sales during 2022, including due to the emergence of new variants of the virus and resulting disruptions in healthcare operations and employee absences among our commercial team. During the first half of 2022, the omicron variant resulted in significant employee absences in our commercial organization due to illness and also impacted operations at sites of care that infuse our medicines and patient access to and willingness to visit healthcare providers. These events resulted in lower new patient enrollment forms, delays in new patients starting infusions and disruptions in therapy. In addition, our clinical trials have been and may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the world are continuing to change because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 is a global issue that has altered business and consumer activity, the biopharmaceutical industry is considered a critical and essential industry in the United States and many other countries and, therefore, we do not currently expect any government-imposed extended shutdowns of suppliers or distribution channels, although our suppliers and other third parties on which we rely could be impacted by employee absences due to COVID-19 illnesses. While certain of our contract manufacturers are involved in manufacturing vaccines for COVID-19, we do not currently expect these activities to impact the future supply of our medicines. In respect of our medicines, we believe we have sufficient inventory of raw materials and finished goods and we expect patients to be able to continue to receive their medicines at a site of care, for our infused medicines, and from their current pharmacies, alternative pharmacies or, if necessary, by direct shipment from our third-party providers that have such capability, for our other medicines.
 

We are continuing to actively monitor the possible impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new variants of the virus such as omicron subvariants, and may take further actions to alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of patients, healthcare providers and our employees. There is significant uncertainty about the duration and potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that our results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business results and outlook represents our estimate based on the information available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 For further information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Risk Factors”, included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 TEPEZZA
 TEPEZZA (teprotumumab-trbw) is a fully human monoclonal antibody and a targeted inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, or IGF-1R, that is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED. TED is a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. While TED often occurs in people living with hyperthyroidism or Graves’ disease, it is a distinct disease that is caused by autoantibodies activating an IGF-1R-mediated signaling complex on cells within the retro-orbital space. This leads to a cascade of negative effects, which may cause long-term, irreversible eye damage. As TED progresses, it causes serious damage – including proptosis (eye bulging), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) and diplopia (double vision) – and in some cases can lead to blindness. Historically, patients have had to live with TED until the inflammation subsides, after which they are often left with permanent and vision-impairing consequences and may require multiple surgeries that do not completely return the patient to their pre-disease state.
 Our comprehensive commercial strategy for TEPEZZA aims to enable more TED patients to benefit from TEPEZZA. We are doing this by: (i) facilitating continued TEPEZZA uptake in the treatment of TED through continued promotion of TEPEZZA to treating physicians; (ii) continuing to develop the TED market by increasing physician awareness of the disease severity and the urgency to diagnose and treat it, as well as the benefits of treatment with TEPEZZA, including through the expansion of our TEPEZZA commercial team and targeting ophthalmologists and endocrinologists; (iii) driving accelerated disease identification and time to treatment through our digital and broadcast marketing campaigns; (iv) enhancing the patient journey with our high-touch, patient-centric model as well as support for the patient and site-of-care referral processes; (v) pursuing more timely access to TEPEZZA for TED patients; (vi) conducting our Phase 4 clinical trial to inform the use TEPEZZA in chronic/low clinical activity score, or CAS, TED; and (vii) pursuing a global expansion strategy to build a global presence in targeted international markets to support the applications for potential approvals and full-scale commercial launches of TEPEZZA in Japan, Brazil, Europe and other international markets over the next several years.
 To advance the continued strong growth and adoption of TEPEZZA, we are continuing to invest in significant expansion efforts in multiple areas: our commercial and field-based organization for TEPEZZA; our marketing initiatives; our long-term supply capacity; and our efforts to expand outside the United States. Due to the wind down of our former inflammation business during 2022, we redeployed a portion of our inflammation commercial team to support our TEPEZZA expansion.
 With the U.S. launch of TEPEZZA in 2020 and the demonstrated benefit to U.S. patients with TED, we are pursuing a global expansion strategy to bring TEPEZZA to patients with TED in other parts of the world. Japan is one of the countries in which we are expanding and, in November 2022, we completed enrollment of a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active TED patients in Japan. We initiated our build-out of infrastructure in Brazil to support potential approvals and commercial launches of TEPEZZA for TED. In October 2022, we announced that we submitted a regulatory filing to the Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) for teprotumumab. In addition, since 2020, we have initiated commercial sales of teprotumumab via the Named Patient Program in other countries within Europe and Asia.
 

As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of TED, TEPEZZA has no direct approved competition. We believe that the results of the TEPEZZA Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials present a significantly high hurdle for potential competitors, given that potentially competitive medicines would be expected to demonstrate similar or greater efficacy and safety in the treatment of TED. In addition, we have biologic reference product exclusivity in the United States covering TEPEZZA that will expire in 2032. Further, the complexity of manufacturing TEPEZZA could pose a barrier to potential biosimilar competition.
 Although TEPEZZA does not face direct competition, other therapies, such as corticosteroids, have been used on an off-label basis to alleviate some of the symptoms of TED. While these therapies have not proved effective in treating the underlying disease, and carry with them potential significant side effects, their off-label use could reduce or delay treatment with TEPEZZA among the addressable patient population. Viridian Therapeutics, Inc., or Viridian, is pursuing development of three anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies for TED (VRDN-001, VRDN-002 and VRDN-003). In August 2022, Viridian announced positive initial clinical data from the first cohort, 10mg/kg, of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for an IGF-1R monoclonal antibody VRDN-001, in patients with TED. On November 14, 2022 and January 8, 2023, Viridian announced positive data for their second and third cohorts, 20mg/kg and 3mg/kg, respectively, of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial showing improvements in signs and symptoms of TED after two infusions. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, Viridian enrolled the first patient in its THRIVE Phase 3 trial of VRDN-001 with active TED. Viridian has also initiated a Phase 2 trial with a subcutaneous version of VRDN-002 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Viridian announced plans to file an investigational new drug, or IND, application for VRDN-003 in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently begin a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers. In addition, Sling Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a Phase 2b study of an oral IGF-1R for the treatment of moderate-to-severe TED and Novartis AG is conducting a Phase 3 trial of Cosentyx®(secukinumab, interleukin-17A inhibitor) in moderate-to-severe TED. Immunovant Inc., or Immunovant, initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials of a fully human anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody candidate for the treatment of active TED, also referred to as Graves’ ophthalmopathy, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Immunovant also began patient recruitment in the Phase 3 trial of batoclimab (FcRni). On January 5, 2023, Acelyrin, Inc., or Acelyrin, announced the acquisition of ValenzaBio Inc, or ValenzaBio. Previously, ValenzaBio received IND clearance and subsequently had begun a Phase 1 trial in the first half of 2022 with VB421, an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody designed for subcutaneous use. In January 2023, Acelyrin also initiated a Phase 1/2 trial in active TED. Argenx SE announced a registrational trial of efgartigimod for the treatment of TED.
 KRYSTEXXA
 A PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme (uricase), KRYSTEXXA (pegloticase injection) is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of uncontrolled gout. Uncontrolled gout occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid, or sUA, and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with conventional therapies, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors, or XOIs, at the maximum medically appropriate dose, or for whom these drugs are contraindicated.
KRYSTEXXA has a unique mechanism of action that can rapidly reverse disease progression. Unlike conventional XOI therapies, which address the over-production or under-excretion of uric acid, KRYSTEXXA converts uric acid into allantoin, a water-soluble molecule, which the body can easily eliminate through the urine. Renal excretion of allantoin is ten times more efficient than uric acid excretion. Additionally, many chronic kidney disease, or CKD, patients have gout, and the disease tends to be more prevalent as CKD advances. While conventional XOI gout therapies can place additional burden on the kidneys and have dosing limitations, KRYSTEXXA has been proven effective and safe for uncontrolled gout patients with CKD without the need to adjust dosing.
Gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis and can be assessed by a simple blood test for the amounts of uric acid in the blood (sUA levels). Typically in gout, when uric acid levels are greater than 6.8 milligrams per deciliter, urate will crystallize and deposit. These hard deposits are known as tophi and may occur anywhere in the body, including joints, as well as organs, such as the kidney and heart. When under-treated medically, tophi often lead to bone erosions and loss of functional ability. Gout flares, a common characteristic of uncontrolled gout, are intensely painful. They may or may not be accompanied by tophi. A systemic disease, uncontrolled gout frequently causes crippling disabilities and significant joint damage. Of the 9.5 million gout sufferers in the United States, we estimate that greater than 100,000 patients have uncontrolled gout.


We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the benefit the medicine offers for patients as well as driving toward its peak U.S. net sales potential. Our growth strategy for KRYSTEXXA includes: (i) supporting the use of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate following the approval of our supplemental biologics license application, or sBLA, in July 2022, which expanded KRYSTEXXA’s labeling to include co-administration with methotrexate; (ii) increasing uptake by rheumatologists; and (iii) accelerating uptake of the medicine by nephrologists.
In 2019, we added a separate group of sales representatives to call exclusively on nephrologists. Due to the wind down of our former inflammation business during 2022, we redeployed a portion of our inflammation commercial team to support our KRYSTEXXA expansion. We believe KRYSTEXXA offers a solution to a clinical need experienced by many nephrologists in dealing with uncontrolled gout patients with CKD.
As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, KRYSTEXXA faces limited direct competition. We believe that the complexity of manufacturing KRYSTEXXA provides a barrier to potential biosimilar competition. However, a number of competitors have medicines in clinical trials, including Selecta Biosciences Inc., or Selecta, which has initiated a Phase 3 clinical program of a candidate for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. In September 2020, Selecta announced topline clinical data that did not meet the primary endpoint or demonstrate statistical superiority for its Phase 2 trial that compared its candidate, which includes an immunomodulator, to KRYSTEXXA alone. In July 2020, Selecta and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, entered into a strategic licensing agreement under which Sobi will assume responsibility for certain development, regulatory, and commercial activities for this candidate. In August 2022, Selecta announced the completion of enrollment for both DISSOLVE trials, the two clinical studies of the Phase 3 DISSOLVE development program of SEL-212 for chronic refractory gout. Selecta has announced that the topline Phase 3 DISSOLVE results will be available in the first quarter of 2023. SEL-212 is a combination of Selecta’s ImmTOR immune tolerance platform and a therapeutic uricase enzyme (pegadricase).
 RAVICTI
 RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients (beginning at birth) with urea cycle disorders, or UCDs, that cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. UCDs are rare, life-threatening genetic disorders. RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (for example, essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline or protein-free calorie supplements).
UCDs are inherited metabolic diseases caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes or transporters that constitute the urea cycle. The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which ammonia, a potent neurotoxin, is converted to urea, which is excreted in the urine. UCD patients may experience episodes during which the ammonia levels in their blood become excessively high, called hyperammonemic crises, which may result in irreversible brain damage, coma or death. We estimate that there are approximately 2,600 patients with UCDs living in the United States, including approximately 1,000 diagnosed patients. RAVICTI is not indicated for treatment of acute hyperammonemia or for N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency.
 UCD symptoms may first occur at any age depending on the severity of the disorder, with more severe defects presenting earlier in life. However, a prompt diagnosis and careful management of the disease can lead to good clinical outcomes.
 RAVICTI competes with older-generation nitrogen scavenger medicines. In the United States, RAVICTI competes with all forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, including BUPHENYL. RAVICTI has advantages over older-generation medicines leading to better patient adherence and compliance rates, such as its better tolerability for patients. It is ingested by mouth, requires little preparation and has little taste and lower sodium content than other nitrogen scavenger medications. RAVICTI could face competition from a few alternative medicine and treatment options that have been recently approved or are in development, including Pheburane®, a taste-masked formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate for which Medunik USA received approval from the FDA in June 2022, a gene-therapy candidate by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., OlpruvaTM, a taste-masked formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate for which ACER Therapeutics Inc. received approval from the FDA in December 2022, an enzyme replacement for a specific UCD subtype (ARG) by Aeglea Bio Therapeutics Inc. and a mRNA-based therapeutic for a specific UCD subtype (OTC) by Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc.
 

Our strategy for RAVICTI is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of UCDs; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, based on the medicine’s differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.
In December 2018 and October 2020, we sold our rights to develop and commercialize RAVICTI outside of North America to Immedica. We previously distributed RAVICTI through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. We have retained rights to RAVICTI in North America.
 PROCYSBI
 PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) is indicated for nephropathic cystinosis, or NC, a rare lysosomal storage disorder that results in the amino acid cystine accumulating inside the lysosomes of nearly every cell. Cystine accumulation results in the formation of crystals that lead to cell damage and death in tissues and organs throughout the body. PROCYSBI delayed-release capsules and delayed-release oral granules is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for NC with 12-hour dosing. PROCYSBI uses proprietary technology that releases cysteamine gradually, providing 12-hour continuous cystine control in adults and children 1 year of age and older. PROCYSBI granules, also called “microbeads,” are composed of cysteamine bitartrate surrounded by an acid-resistant enteric coating. To work properly, PROCYSBI microbeads must dissolve and release cysteamine bitartrate in the small intestine. The coating on the microbeads helps to control where and how medicine is released by allowing the cysteamine bitartrate to pass through the acidic stomach to the alkaline environment of the small intestine. Once in the small intestine, the coating begins to dissolve and the microbeads release cysteamine bitartrate gradually. This allows PROCYSBI to control cystine levels continuously over the dosing interval. Randomized controlled clinical trials and extended treatment with PROCYSBI therapy demonstrated consistent cystine depletion as monitored by levels of the biomarker (and surrogate marker), white blood cell cystine concentration.
 In NC patients, elevated cystine can lead to cellular dysfunction and death; without treatment, the disease is usually fatal by the end of the first decade of life. Cystinosis is progressive, eventually causing irreversible tissue damage and multi-organ failure, including kidney failure, blindness, muscle wasting and premature death. NC is usually diagnosed in infancy after children display symptoms to physicians, including markedly increased urination, thirst, dehydration, gastrointestinal distress, failure to thrive, rickets, photophobia and kidney symptoms specific to Fanconi syndrome. Management of cystinosis requires lifelong therapy.
 In February 2020, the FDA approved PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets for adults and children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis. The PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets product is the same as the PROCYSBI capsules product except in respect of the packaging format. This granules in packets dosage form provides another administration option for patients, in addition to the PROCYSBI capsules. PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets were made commercially available in April 2020.
 PROCYSBI is differentiated by its ability to control cystine concentration continuously over twelve hours. Older therapies require administration of medicine every six hours. By taking PROCYSBI, patients have to dose only twice a day, providing them greater control over their medication schedule and lifestyle. Additionally, because PROCYSBI can be administered through a feeding tube or mixed with approved foods and liquids, the patient can choose a more flexible dosing regimen. PROCYSBI may also have fewer known side effects, such as less severe bad breath (halitosis) and body odor, than older-generation therapies.
 We estimate that there are approximately 500-550 patients diagnosed with NC living in the United States. In addition to patients who have already been identified, we believe that a number of patients with atypical phenotypic presentation and end-stage renal disease have their condition as a result of undiagnosed late-onset NC and would benefit from treatment with PROCYSBI.
 PROCYSBI faces competition from Cystagon® for the treatment of cystinosis. Cystagon, an immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsule, is an older-generation systemic cystine-depleting therapy for cystinosis in the United States marketed by Mylan N.V., and by Orphan Europe SARL in markets outside of the United States. Additionally, we are also aware that AVROBIO, Inc. has a gene therapy candidate in development for the treatment of cystinosis. We believe that PROCYSBI will continue to be well received in the market and continue to expect Cystagon to be the primary competitor for PROCYSBI for the foreseeable future.
 Our strategy for PROCYSBI is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the uptake of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.


UPLIZNA
 UPLIZNA (inebilizumab-cdon) is an anti-CD19 humanized monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, including the pathogenic cells that produce autoantibodies. In some autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies secreted by plasmablasts and plasma cells attack native tissues as opposed to foreign pathogens. UPLIZNA depletes these plasmablasts that may produce pathogenic autoantibodies. UPLIZNA was approved for the treatment of adults with AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD by the FDA in June 2020, by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in March 2021, by China’s National Medical Products Administration in March 2022, by the European Commission in April 2022 and by the Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) in December 2022.
NMOSD is a rare, severe autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies produced by B cells attack the optic nerve, spinal cord and brain/brainstem, often causing permanent blindness, weakness, and/or paralysis. NMOSD is characterized by unpredictable attacks and severe disability that often occurs following the first attack, accumulating with each subsequent relapse. Thus, preventing these attacks is the primary goal for disease management. NMOSD is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, or MS, which can be problematic since some MS treatments may exacerbate NMOSD. UPLIZNA is an infused medicine that works by depleting B-cells in a targeted manner and is proven to reduce NMOSD attacks.
 In Japan, our strategic partner, MTPC has the rights to develop and commercialize UPLIZNA. In March 2021, MTPC received manufacturing and marketing approval for UPLIZNA in Japan. UPLIZNA was launched in Japan during the second quarter of 2021. Furthermore, in April 2022, the European Commission issued a legally binding decision based on the favorable recommendation of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to grant a Marketing Authorization for UPLIZNA for the treatment of adult patients with NMOSD in the European Union, or EU. We are continuing to invest in our European infrastructure to support the European launch of UPLIZNA for NMOSD, which began in Germany and Austria; and in France under an early access program, in the third quarter of 2022. We are also preparing for the planned commercial launch of UPLIZNA in Italy and Spain in 2023. Hansoh has rights to develop and commercialize UPLIZNA for NMOSD as well as other potential future indications in China. In March 2022, Hansoh received notice that UPLIZNA was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of adults with NMOSD. The launch of UPLIZNA in China began in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to build-out our infrastructure in Brazil to support the planned commercial launch of UPLIZNA for NMOSD in 2023.
 UPLIZNA is the only approved NMOSD therapy in the United States that has demonstrated a clinically relevant and durable effect on delaying worsening of disability, with a significant reduction in hospitalization. Long-term UPLIZNA treatment has been shown to be well tolerated and provide a sustained reduction in NMOSD attack risk for four or more years. UPLIZNA faces competition from eculizumab, marketed as Soliris® by AstraZeneca plc, and satralizumab, marketed as EnspryngTM by Genentech/Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., each for the treatment of patients with NMOSD. In addition, AstraZeneca announced positive primary endpoint results from its Phase 3 trial with Ultomiris® (ravulizumab) in NMOSD and, if approved for this indication, UPLIZNA could face additional competition. Ultomiris is currently under regulatory review in both the United States and EU with potential approval in the first half of 2023. UPLIZNA also faces competition from rituximab, an off-label treatment that has been used for years to treat NMOSD given the lack of an approved medicine for this disease prior to 2019. Other novel treatments are under development for NMOSD, including Phase 3 candidates being developed by Beijing Mabworks Biotech Co. Ltd. and RemeGen Co. Ltd., and Phase 2 candidates, including a candidate being developed by Chord Therapeutics SA/Merck KGaA.
 With respect to our strategy for UPLIZNA, which leverages the successful strategies we have employed with TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA, our aim is to (i) increase physician awareness of the benefits of UPLIZNA for the treatment of NMOSD, and what differentiates UPLIZNA from other medicines by generating additional trial data analyses and clinical evidence; (ii) drive patient initiation and adherence, and cultivate a positive patient experience; and (iii) maximize the potential of UPLIZNA through additional indications and global expansion, including potential approvals and commercial launches of UPLIZNA in additional markets in the coming years.
 

ACTIMMUNE
 ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) is indicated for chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD, and severe, malignant osteopetrosis, or SMO. It is a biologically manufactured protein called interferon gamma-1b that is similar to a protein the human body makes naturally. Interferon gamma helps prevent infection in CGD patients and enhances osteoclast function in SMO patients. ACTIMMUNE is the only medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with CGD and for delaying disease progression in patients with SMO. ACTIMMUNE is believed to work by modifying the cellular function of various cells, including those in the immune system and those that help form bones.
 CGD is a genetic disorder of the immune system. It is described as a primary immunodeficiency disorder, which means it is not caused by another disease or disorder. In people who have CGD, a type of white blood cell called a phagocyte is defective. These defective phagocytes cannot generate superoxide, leading to an inability to kill harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. As a result, the immune system is weakened. People with CGD are more likely to have certain problems, such as recurrent severe and potentially life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. These patients are prone to developing masses called granulomas, which can occur repeatedly in organs throughout the body and cause a variety of problems. We estimate that there are approximately 1,200 patients with CGD in the United States, based on an estimated incidence of 1:200,000 live births.
 SMO is a form of osteopetrosis and is sometimes referred to as marble bone disease or malignant infantile osteopetrosis because it occurs in very young children. While exact numbers are not known, it has been estimated that one out of 250,000 children are born with SMO.
ACTIMMUNE currently faces limited competition. There are additional or alternative approaches used to treat patients with CGD and SMO, including the increasing trend towards the potentially curative treatment of bone marrow transplants in patients with CGD, however, there are currently no FDA approved medicines indicated for CGD and SMO on the market that compete directly with ACTIMMUNE.
 Our strategy for ACTIMMUNE is to increase awareness and diagnosis of CGD; to drive utilization of ACTIMMUNE prophylaxis in newly diagnosed CGD patients as recommended in current treatment guidelines; encourage use of ACTIMMUNE in CGD patients prior to bone marrow transplant and in symptomatic carriers of x-linked CGD; and increase compliance rates overall.
 BUPHENYL
 BUPHENYL (sodium phenylbutyrate) tablets and BUPHENYL powder are made from granules that contain sodium phenylbutyrate as the active (chemically synthesized) ingredient and microcrystalline cellulose as a diluent.
BUPHENYL tablets for oral administration and BUPHENYL powder for oral, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tube administration are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase or argininosuccinic acid synthetase.
BUPHENYL is indicated for treatment of all patients with neonatal-onset deficiency (complete enzymatic deficiency, presenting within the first twenty-eight days of life). It is also indicated for treatment of patients with late-onset disease (partial enzymatic deficiency, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. It is important that the diagnosis be made early and treatment initiated immediately to improve clinical outcomes. BUPHENYL must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation. We distribute BUPHENYL in the United States.
QUINSAIR
 QUINSAIR (levofloxacin) is a formulation of the antibiotic drug levofloxacin, suitable for inhalation via a nebulizer and indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF. CF is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 people worldwide, and results in build-up of abnormally thick secretions that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death.
INFLAMMATION MEDICINES
 Our portfolio also includes medicines that treat inflammatory diseases. PENNSAID 2% (diclofenac sodium topical solution) is indicated for the treatment of pain of osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee(s). OA is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. RAYOS (prednisone) is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of multiple conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, or RA; ankylosing spondylitis, or AS; polymyalgia rheumatica; systemic lupus erythematosus; and a number of other conditions. DUEXIS (ibuprofen/famotidine) is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of RA and OA and to decrease the risk of developing upper-gastrointestinal ulcers in patients who are taking ibuprofen for these indications. RA is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling, primarily in the joints. VIMOVO (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium) is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of OA, RA and AS, and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastric ulcers. At present, PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO face generic competition in the United States and we are expecting a generic version of RAYOS to enter the market in 2023.
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, we substantially completed our planned wind down of our former inflammation business, including active promotion efforts and associated HorizonCares support. As a result, we expect sales of our inflammation medicines to be immaterial on a go-forward basis.
 Research and Development
 Our R&D programs include preclinical and clinical development of new medicine candidates, as well as development programs intended to maximize the benefit and value of our existing medicines. We devote significant resources to R&D activities that address critical unmet medical needs for people impacted by rare, autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases. Our pipeline includes more than 20 programs. We announced the initiation of five clinical trials in 2022 and expect to initiate several more in 2023, including a planned Phase 3 program for dazodalibep in Sjögren’s syndrome. In January 2023, we announced the initiation of our daxdilimab discoid lupus erythematosus, or DLE, Phase 2 trial. The graphic below summarizes our R&D programs ranging from preclinical to Phase 3 as of March 1, 2023.

(1) Planned programs; not yet initiated. (2) External collaboration.

 We also have three Phase 4 programs: TEPEZZA chronic/low CAS TED, KRYSTEXXA shorter infusion duration and KRYSTEXXA monthly dosing.
 

UPLIZNA Clinical Programs
 UPLIZNA is an anti-CD19 humanized monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, including the pathogenic cells that produce autoantibodies. UPLIZNA is approved by the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of NMOSD. We are currently evaluating UPLIZNA in two additional indications: myasthenia gravis (a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial) and IgG4-related disease (a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial).
Daxdilimab Clinical Programs
 Daxdilimab is an anti-ILT7 human monoclonal antibody that depletes certain dendritic cells. Depleting these cells may interrupt the cycle of inflammation that causes tissue damage in diseases such as lupus and a variety of other autoimmune conditions. We are currently evaluating daxdilimab in two Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in systemic lupus erythematosus and DLE. We also have a Phase 2 open-label trial underway to evaluate daxdilimab in patients with alopecia areata. We expect to initiate two Phase 2 clinical trials in additional potential indications, lupus nephritis and dermatomyositis/anti-synthetase inflammatory myositis, in 2023.
Dazodalibep Clinical Programs
 Dazodalibep is a CD40 ligand antagonist that blocks T-cell interaction with CD40-expressing B cells, disrupting the overactivation of the CD40 ligand co-stimulatory pathway. We are evaluating dazodalibep in several autoimmune diseases associated with the overactivation of this pathway. In September 2022 and January 2023, we announced positive top-line results of our Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Sjögren’s syndrome: both study populations met the primary endpoints and dazodalibep was well-tolerated. Based on the positive outcome of this trial, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program in 2023. We also completed a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that established proof of concept in rheumatoid arthritis in May 2022. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating dazodalibep in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 2023.
HZN-825 Clinical Programs
 HZN-825 is an oral selective LPAR1 antagonist that prevents gene activation and has demonstrated antifibrotic activity. HZN-825 is in Phase 2 development for diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 ADX-914 Clinical Programs (collaboration with Q32 Bio Inc.)
ADX-914 is a fully human anti-IL-7Rα antibody that re-regulates adaptive immune function by blocking signaling mediated by both IL-7 and TSLP. ADX-914 is part of our global collaboration and option agreement with Q32 Bio Inc. for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which we entered into in August 2022. We announced the initiation of a Phase 2 trial to evaluate ADX-914 in atopic dermatitis in October 2022, and we expect an additional Phase 2 trial in a second autoimmune disease to be initiated in 2023. We have an option to acquire ADX-914 exercisable through a period following completion of the Phase 2 trials; until then, Q32 is operationally responsible for the conduct of all program-related activities.
TEPEZZA Clinical Programs
 TEPEZZA is an IGF-1R antagonist monoclonal antibody. It is the first and only medicine approved by the FDA for the treatment of TED. Two TEPEZZA clinical programs are underway: OPTIC-J, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active TED patients in Japan and a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic clinical trial for subcutaneous administration of TEPEZZA. Enrollment in OPTIC-J was completed in November 2022. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in chronic/low CAS TED in Japan in 2023.
HZN-1116 Autoimmune Disease Program
HZN-1116 is a human monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize the FLT3-ligand, thereby reducing both conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells that play a key role in driving inflammatory processes. We are currently evaluating HZN-1116 in a Phase 1 clinical trial for autoimmune diseases.
 HZN-457 Gout Program (collaboration with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
HZN-457 is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) candidate designed to treat gout by silencing liver xanthine dehydrogenase. The development of HZN-457 is part of our global collaboration and license agreement with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. HZN-457 is aimed at addressing the unmet need for the more than 500,000 gout patients who do not respond to the current standard of conventional care and are not good candidates for KRYSTEXXA. We initiated a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in December 2022 to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457.
Preclinical Programs
 Our preclinical program with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC is exploring the potential for a novel therapeutic to address the unmet need of gout patients unresponsive to conventional treatments or KRYSTEXXA. Our preclinical program with Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. is focused on developing novel protein-based therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are leveraging external collaborations for these programs, using the specialized technologies of our collaboration partners in combination with our internal expertise.
Phase 4 TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA Programs
 Our ongoing TEPEZZA Phase 4 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in chronic/low CAS TED is designed to better inform physicians and payers on the safety and efficacy of TEPEZZA in TED patients with a low CAS. We completed enrollment in this trial in September 2022 and expect topline results to be available in the second quarter of 2023.
 We are exploring the potential to improve the patient experience with two Phase 4 KRYSTEXXA open-label clinical trials currently underway. Both involve the co-administration of KRYSTEXXA plus the immunomodulator methotrexate. One trial is evaluating a shorter-infusion duration, and the other, our monthly dosing trial, is evaluating less frequent infusions.
An important development in 2022 was the approval by the FDA of our sBLA to expand the KRYSTEXXA label to include co-administration with methotrexate. The approval was based on six- and twelve-month results from our MIRROR randomized controlled trial completed in 2021, which demonstrated significant improvements in response rate and sustained patient response of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate compared to KRYSTEXXA with placebo, as well as a significant reduction in infusion reactions.


Distribution
 We use a regulatory compliant third-party logistics organization for storage and distribution of our medicines into the supply chain. Our third-party logistics provider specializes in the healthcare industry with operations that include warehousing and transportation services that can be scaled and customized to our needs based on market conditions and the demands and delivery service requirements for our medicines and materials. Their services eliminate the need to build dedicated internal infrastructures that would be difficult to scale without significant capital investment. Our third-party logistics provider warehouses all medicines in controlled regulatory compliant facilities. Incoming orders are prepared and shipped through an order entry system to ensure adequate supply and delivery of our medicines.
Sales and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2022, our sales force was composed of approximately 380 sales representatives. Due to the impact of the at-risk launch of generic PENNSAID 2% and the wind down of our former inflammation business during 2022, we redeployed a portion of our inflammation commercial team to support our TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA expansions.
 Our sales representatives focus on marketing our rare disease medicines to a limited number of healthcare practitioners who specialize in fields such as pediatric immunology, allergy, infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, rheumatology, nephrology, ophthalmology and endocrinology, to help them understand the potential benefits of our medicines. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, agreements with third parties to commercialize our medicines outside the United States.
 We have a comprehensive compliance program in place to address adherence with various laws and regulations relating to our sales, marketing, and manufacturing of our medicines, as well as certain third-party relationships, including pharmacies. Specifically with respect to pharmacies, the compliance program utilizes a variety of methods and tools to monitor and audit pharmacies, including those that participate in our patient assistance programs, to confirm their activities, adjudication and practices are consistent with our compliance policies and guidance.
 

Manufacturing, Commercial, Supply and License Agreements
 We have agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, biological drug substance and drug product, manufacture of our medicines, formulation and development services. We also have agreements for fill, finish and packaging services, transportation, and distribution and logistics services for certain medicines. In all cases, we retain certain levels of safety stock or maintain alternate supply relationships that we can utilize without undue disruption of our manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations.
 In July 2021, we purchased a drug product biologics manufacturing facility in Waterford, Ireland, which is intended to be an additional source of manufacturing to supplement the capabilities of our third-party drug product manufacturers. We are in the process of completing the build-out and validation of this facility and assuming timely receipt of regulatory approvals, we expect the first medicine manufactured for commercial use at the facility to be approved for release in the second half of 2023. In August 2022, we submitted a planning application to build a drug substance biologics manufacturing facility adjacent to our existing drug product biologics manufacturing facility in Waterford, Ireland. Based on our current operating plan, we do not anticipate making significant investments in building a drug substance biologics manufacturing facility during 2023.
 TEPEZZA
 TEPEZZA is produced by culture of a genetically engineered mammalian cell line containing the DNA which encodes for teprotumumab-trbw, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Cell culture broth is harvested and purified through filtration processes and chromatography processes prior to being formulated, frozen and shipped to the site of drug product manufacture. In support of its manufacturing process, we store multiple vials of teprotumumab-trbw master cell bank and working cell bank at multiple locations in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
AGC Biologics Supply Agreement

Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals may also terminate the agreement if we challenge the validity of certain of its patent rights.
Other Agreements
 In addition to the above supply and license agreements, under the agreement for the acquisition of River Vision in May 2017, we were required to pay up to $325.0 million upon the attainment of various milestones, composed of $100.0 million related to FDA approval and $225.0 million related to net sales thresholds for TEPEZZA. We made a $100.0 million milestone payment related to FDA approval during the first quarter of 2020. The agreement also included a royalty payment of 3 percent of the portion of annual worldwide net sales exceeding $300.0 million.
In April 2020, we entered into an agreement with S.R. One, Limited, or S.R. One, and an agreement with Lundbeckfond Invest A/S, or Lundbeckfond, pursuant to which we acquired all of S.R. One’s and Lundbeckfond’s beneficial rights to proceeds from certain contingent future TEPEZZA milestone and royalty payments in exchange for a one-time payment of $55.0 million to each of the respective parties. As a result of our agreements with S.R. One and Lundbeckfond in April 2020, our remaining net obligations to make TEPEZZA payments to the former stockholders of River Vision was reduced by approximately 70.25%, after including payments to a third party.
 This resulted in milestone payments of $67.0 million to the other former River Vision stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021. There are no further TEPEZZA net sales milestone obligations remaining to the former River Vision stockholders. In addition, as a result of the S.R. One and Lundbeckfond agreements, annual earnout payments of 0.893 percent are due on the portion of annual worldwide net sales exceeding $300.0 million.
 

KRYSTEXXA
 KRYSTEXXA is produced by fermentation of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacterium containing the DNA which encodes for uricase. The complementary DNA coding for the uricase is based on mammalian sequences. Uricase is purified and is then PEGylated with a PEGylation agent to produce the bulk medicine, pegloticase. PEGylation and purification of the active drug substance is achieved by conventional column chromatography. The resulting highly purified sterile solution is filled in a single-use vial for intravenous infusion following dilution. In support of its manufacturing process, we store multiple vials of the Escherichia coli bacterium master cell bank and working cell bank at multiple locations in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
NOF Supply Agreement
 Under the terms of our exclusive supply agreement with NOF Corporation, or NOF, as amended, for the PEGylation agent used in the manufacture of KRYSTEXXA, we are required to issue NOF forecasts of our requirements for the PEGylation agent, a portion of which are binding. Under the agreement, we are obligated to purchase a certain minimum quantity of the PEGylation agent over specified periods of time and we are required to use NOF as our exclusive supplier for the PEGylation agent, subject to certain exceptions if NOF is unable to supply the PEGylation agent. The agreement expires in October 2024. Either we or NOF may also terminate the agreement upon a material breach, if not cured within a specified period of time, or in the event of the other party’s insolvency.
Bio-Technology General (Israel) Supply Agreement
 We have a commercial supply agreement, as amended, with Bio-Technology General (Israel) Ltd, or BTG Israel, for the production of the bulk KRYSTEXXA medicine, or bulk product. Under this agreement, we have agreed to purchase certain minimum annual order quantities and are obligated to purchase at least 80 percent of our annual world-wide bulk product requirements from BTG Israel. The term of the agreement runs until December 31, 2030, and will automatically renew for successive three-year periods unless earlier terminated by either party upon three years’ prior written notice. The agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in the event of a force majeure, liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, uncured material breach by the other party or after January 1, 2024, upon three years’ prior written notice. Under the agreement, if the manufacture of the bulk product is moved out of Israel, we may be required to obtain the approval of the Israel Innovation Authority (formerly known as Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist), or IIA, because certain KRYSTEXXA intellectual property was initially developed with a grant funded by the IIA. We must provide BTG with rolling forecasts of the volume of KRYSTEXXA that we expect to order, with a portion of the forecast being a firm and binding order.
Exelead PharmaSource Supply Agreement

 UCSD License Agreement
 In May 2017, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, San Diego, or UCSD, which was amended in September 2018. We must pay UCSD a royalty in the mid-single digits on net sales of PROCYSBI in countries where PROCYSBI is covered by a patent right, and a royalty in the low-single digits on net sales of PROCYSBI in countries where PROCYSBI is not covered by a patent right.
UPLIZNA
 UPLIZNA is produced by culture of a genetically engineered mammalian cell line containing the DNA which encodes for inebilizumab-cdon, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Cell culture broth is harvested and purified through filtration processes and chromatography processes prior to being formulated, frozen, thawed, and shipped to the site of drug product manufacture. In support of its manufacturing process, we store multiple vials of inebilizumab-cdon master cell bank and working cell bank at multiple locations in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
 We have a commercial supply agreement with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP for the manufacture and supply of UPLIZNA drug substance and drug product. The initial period of this agreement is 10 years from April 2019 and will automatically renew for separate but successive three-year terms unless 24 months advance written notice is given by either party that it does not intend to renew. We must provide AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP with rolling forecasts for drug substance and drug product, with a portion of the forecasts being a firm and binding order.
 ACTIMMUNE
 ACTIMMUNE is a recombinant protein that is produced by fermentation of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacterium containing the DNA which encodes for the human protein. Purification of the active drug substance is achieved by conventional column chromatography. The resulting active drug substance is then formulated as a highly purified sterile solution and filled in a single-use vial for subcutaneous injection, which is the ACTIMMUNE finished drug product. In support of its manufacturing process, we and Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or Boehringer Ingelheim, store multiple vials of the Escherichia coli bacterium master cell bank and working cell bank in order to ensure adequate backup should any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
OTHER MEDICINES
 PENNSAID 2% is manufactured on a contract basis by a third party. We purchase API for RAYOS from a contract manufacturer. In addition, we have contracted with two separate third-party manufacturers for the production of RAYOS tablets and for the packaging and assembling of RAYOS. BUPHENYL API is manufactured on a contract basis by a third party and final manufacturing, testing and packaging of the medicine is provided by another third party. The two APIs for DUEXIS are manufactured on a contract basis by two separate third parties. The final packaged form of DUEXIS is provided on a contract basis from an additional third party. The two APIs for VIMOVO are manufactured on a contract basis by two separate third parties. The final packaged form of VIMOVO is provided on a contract basis from an additional third party. QUINSAIR drug product, its API, levofloxacin hemihydrate, and the Zirela nebulizer device are all manufactured on a contract basis by three separate third parties.
Intellectual Property
 Our objective is to aggressively patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have a portfolio of patents and applications based on our R&D, clinical and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling discoveries, and our novel formulations. We intend to continue filing patent applications seeking intellectual property protection as we generate discoveries from R&D, anticipated formulation refinements, new methods of manufacturing and clinical trial results. The intellectual property with respect to certain of our medicines is set forth below. At present, PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and VIMOVO face generic competition in the United States and we are expecting a generic version of RAYOS to enter the market in 2023.
 We will only be able to protect our technologies and medicines from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. As such, our commercial success will depend in part on receiving and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our technologies and medicines as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges.
 The patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example:
 •we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;
 •we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;
 •others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;
 •it is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;
 •our issued patents and the issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;
 •we may not be successful in any patent litigation to enforce our patent rights;
 •we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or medicine candidates that are patentable; or
 •the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.
 TEPEZZA
 We are either a licensee or owner of U.S. and foreign patents and applications covering TEPEZZA. If not otherwise invalidated, those patents expire between July 2024 and April 2039. We continue to prosecute and pursue patent protection to obtain additional patent coverage on TEPEZZA and its uses. Additionally, we have a biologic exclusivity in the United States covering TEPEZZA that will expire in 2032.
KRYSTEXXA
 We have licenses to U.S. and foreign patents and applications covering KRYSTEXXA. If not otherwise invalidated, those patents expire between July 2023 and June 2030. We continue to prosecute and pursue patent protection to obtain additional patent coverage on KRYSTEXXA and its uses.
RAVICTI
 We have ownership of or licenses to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering RAVICTI. If not otherwise invalidated, those patents expire between 2030 and 2036. We license our rights to patents and patent applications outside of North America to Immedica.
 In the United States, RAVICTI received two separate orphan drug exclusivities for two patient populations. The first of those orphan drug exclusivities expired on February 1, 2020, and the second will expire on April 28, 2024. Under our settlement and license agreement with Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. may enter the market on July 1, 2025, or earlier in certain circumstances. We also have settlement and license agreements with Lupin Limited and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or collectively Lupin; and Annora Pharma Private Limited and Hetero USA, Inc., or collectively Annora, pursuant to which Lupin and Annora may enter the market on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.
 PROCYSBI
 We have U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering PROCYSBI, as well as licenses from the University of California, San Diego to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering PROCYSBI. If not otherwise invalidated, those patents expire between 2027 and 2036.
PROCYSBI received marketing authorization in September 2013 from the European Commission for marketing in the EU. PROCYSBI received ten years of market exclusivity, through 2023, as an orphan drug in the EU, European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, or UK.
In the United States, PROCYSBI received seven years of market exclusivity, until December 22, 2024, for patients one year of age to less than two years of age as an orphan drug. During December 2017, the FDA awarded pediatric exclusivity to PROCYSBI in the United States, which adds an additional six-month exclusivity period to the end of certain orphan exclusivity periods and patent terms covering PROCYSBI. Under our settlement and license agreement with Lupin, Lupin may enter the market on March 31, 2030, or earlier in certain circumstances.
UPLIZNA
 We have U.S. and foreign patents and applications and licenses to U.S. and foreign patents and applications covering UPLIZNA.

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our medicines successfully depends in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payers, including, in the United States, government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. This is especially true in markets where over-the-counter and generic options exist. Even if coverage is made available by a third-party payer, the reimbursement rates paid for covered medicines might not be adequate. For example, third-party payers may use tiered coverage and may adversely affect demand for our medicines by not covering our medicines or by placing them in a more expensive formulary tier relative to competitive medicines (where patients have to pay relatively more out of pocket than for medicines in a lower tier). In addition, we are continuing to see a shift away from co-pay accumulators and an increase in co-pay maximizers putting higher out of pocket costs on the patient. We cannot be certain that our medicines will be covered by third-party payers or that such coverage, where available, will be adequate, or that our medicines will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies. Many states in the United States have also created preferred drug lists for use in their Medicaid programs and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. The industry competition to be included on such formularies and preferred drug lists often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient assistance to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other therapeutic alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any medicine to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our medicines for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with studies, our medicines may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than competitive medicines, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our medicines or our medicine candidates. These pricing and reimbursement pressures may create negative perceptions to any medicine price increases, or limit the amount we may be able to increase our medicine prices, which may adversely affect our medicine sales and results of operations. Where coverage and reimbursement are not adequate, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such medicines, and patients may decline to purchase them. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our medicines and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 The U.S. market has seen a trend in which retail pharmacies have become increasingly involved in determining which prescriptions will be filled with the requested medicine or a substitute medicine, based on a number of factors, including potentially perceived medicine costs and benefits, as well as payer medicine substitution policies. Many states have in place requirements for prescribers to indicate “dispense as written” on their prescriptions if they do not want pharmacies to make medicine substitutions; these requirements are varied and not consistent across states. We may need to increasingly spend time and resources to ensure the prescriptions written for our medicines are filled as written, where appropriate.
 Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and medicine pricing regulation have been subject to significant change, and may change further at any time, particularly given recent political focus on the pharmaceutical industry. Even if favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement status is attained for one or more medicines, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.


Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose extensive requirements upon the non-clinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, promotion, pricing, import, export, storage and distribution of medicines. These agencies and other regulatory authorities regulate R&D activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, additional reporting obligations and/or authority oversight, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of medicines, partial or total suspension of production, suspension, variation or withdrawal of marketing approval or withdrawal of a medicine from the market.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and biologics additionally under the Public Health Service Act. The process required by the FDA before medicine candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
 •completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests and pre-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicine candidate for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, as appropriate, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the medicine candidate for the indication for use; 
 •a determination by the FDA within sixty days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, regulations for pharmaceuticals; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the medicine in the United States. 
 The results of pre-clinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular medicine candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during medicine development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 In the EU, approval must be obtained from the competent authorities of EU Member States before clinical trials are commenced. In addition, medicinal products may only be marketed if a marketing authorization has been obtained from the competent regulatory authorities. The related process is described below.
 

Clinical Trials in the United States. For purposes of NDA or BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
•Phase 1. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the medicine candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients. 
 •Phase 2. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the medicine for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the medicine is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 
 •Phase 4. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a medicine candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the medicine after approval under a post-marketing commitment or post- marketing requirement. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a medicine. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 The results of drug development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, as appropriate. Applications also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information. Applications must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within twelve months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, eight months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer to ensure that the medicine can be reliably produced in compliance with cGMPs and will typically inspect certain clinical trial sites for compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an application by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with boxed warnings on medicine labeling or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a medicine. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw medicine approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the medicine reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved medicines which have been commercialized and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a medicine based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information.
Clinical Trials in the EU. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Certain preclinical (also termed “non-clinical”) data is required in order to enable clinical trials to be used for a marketing authorization application. The requisite amount of preclinical data enables the design of a clinical trial, from Phase 1 (first-in-human clinical trials) through to Phases 2 and 3, which are quality, safety and efficacy studies. During all phases of clinical development, national competent authorities of EU Member States and other comparable regulatory authorities require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators.
 In the EU, clinical trials are governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or CTR, which entered into application on January 31, 2022. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations governing clinical trials, including the Good Clinical Practice Directive 2005/28. It is recommended that studies also be conducted in accordance with all applicable EMA, European Commission and national guidelines. Specific GCP guidelines from the European Commission apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.


Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from competent authorities of EU Member States in which the sponsor intends on carrying out clinical trials, and a positive opinion from an independent Ethics Committee. The CTR, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States, introduces an application procedure through a single-entry point, the “EU portal”, the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS. Since January 31, 2023, the use of CTIS has become mandatory for all clinical trial sponsors submitting initial applications for the approval of their clinical trials in the EU. The CTR also establishes a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application including, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation; as well as new reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
 A harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials has been introduced and is divided into two parts. Assessment of Part I is led by the competent authorities of a reference Member State selected by the trial sponsor and relates to clinical trial aspects that are considered to be scientifically harmonized across EU Member States. This assessment is then submitted to the competent authorities of all the concerned Member States in which the trial is to be conducted for their review. Part II is assessed separately by the competent authorities and Ethics Committees in each concerned EU Member State. Each concerned Member State will issue a single decision on the authorization of the clinical trial including input from the national competent authority and Ethics Committee. Individual EU Member States, therefore, retain the power to authorize the conduct of clinical trials in their territory.
 The CTR establishes a general principle according to which information contained in CTIS shall be made publicly accessible unless confidentiality is justified on grounds of protecting personal data, or commercially confidential information, necessary to protect confidential communications between EU Member States in relation to the preparation of an assessment report, or necessary to ensure effective supervision of the conduct of a clinical trial by EU Member States. This confidentiality exception may be overruled if there is an overriding public interest in disclosure.
 The extent to which on-going clinical trials, for which an application for approval was submitted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20 before January 31, 2023, will be governed by the CTR will depend on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after January 31, 2022, the CTR will begin to apply to the clinical trial after expiry of this three-year period. The Regulation will apply to clinical trials from an earlier date if the clinical trial has already transitioned to the CTR framework.
 In all cases, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with the guidelines on cGMP and in a GMP licensed facility, which can be subject to GMP inspections.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national competent authorities of EU Member States provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs.
 EU Review and Approval Process. To obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA, for a product in the EU, an applicant must submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). An MA may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) products designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, and (iv) products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, authorization through the centralized procedure is optional on related approval.


Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, conducts the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing MA.
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product targeting an unmet medical need is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops). The CHMP can, however, revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized MA procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies’ Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures – Human, or CMDh, for review. The subsequent decision of the European Commission is binding on all EU Member States.
 The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. Like the decentralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the MA of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national MA may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the MA delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
 An MA has, in principle, an initial validity of five years. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State in which the original MA was granted. To support the application, the MA holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the eCTD (Common Technical Document) providing up-to-date data concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, including all variations introduced since the MA was granted, at least nine months before the MA ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year renewal period for the MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (for a centralized MA) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicinal products that target unmet medical needs. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicinal product will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted.


In the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The European Commission may grant a conditional MA for a medicinal product if it is demonstrated that all of the following criteria are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization; (iii) the medicinal product fulfills an unmet medical need; and (iv) the benefit of the immediate availability to patients of the medicinal product is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled. Once any pending studies are provided, the conditional MA can be converted into a traditional MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA and approved by the European Commission, the MA will cease to be renewed.
 An MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” where the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. These circumstances may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the state of scientific knowledge at that time, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. Like a conditional MA, an MA granted in exceptional circumstances is reserved to medicinal products intended to be authorized for treatment of rare diseases or unmet medical needs for which the applicant does not hold a complete data set that is required for the grant of a standard MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, an applicant for authorization in exceptional circumstances is not subsequently required to provide the missing data. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually, and the MA will be withdrawn if the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
 EU Data and Marketing Exclusivity. The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving an MA in the EU, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 In the EU, there is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided in support of an application for marketing authorization. Guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological products.
 EU Pediatric Development. In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that all marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products must include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO may grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures provided in the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Furthermore, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all EU Member States and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six month extension to the Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, if any is in effect at the time of authorization or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as certain countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.


Orphan Medicines. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a medicine available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the medicine. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a medicine with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the medicine generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another medicine under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent medicine with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved medicine on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
 In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, provides that a medicine can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that: (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (ii) either (a) such conditions affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU, or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product. An application for the designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product must be submitted at any stage of development of the medicinal product but before filing of an MAA. An MA for an orphan medicinal product may only include indications designated as orphan. For non-orphan indications treated with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, a separate marketing authorization has to be sought.
 Orphan medicinal product designation entitles an applicant to incentives such fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized marketing authorization procedure. Upon grant of a marketing authorization, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication in all EU Member States, which means that the EMA cannot accept another marketing authorization application, or grant a marketing authorization, or accept an application to extend for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extendable to twelve years for medicinal products that have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this medicine is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the register of orphan products. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.


Following Brexit there is no pre-market orphan designation for products in the UK. Orphan designation in the UK is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is responsible for reviewing applications for orphan designation at the time of the marketing authorization application (for further details on the impact the UK leaving the EU has and will have, see the section entitled ‘The Impact of Brexit’ below).
 Other Regulatory Requirements. Medicines manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual medicine quality review, payment of program fees and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the medicine must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Our medicines may be subject to REMS requirements that affect labeling, distribution or post market reporting. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and untitled letters or warning letters that could cause us or our third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities. A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines. In addition to Form 483 notices and untitled letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of medicine, injunctive action, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, import alert or possible civil penalties. The FDA may also require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval for that medicine.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet, including certain social media activities. Medicines may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the medicine, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental application, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled letters, corrective advertising and potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our medicines or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results.


Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available pharmaceuticals for uses that are not described in the medicine’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of medicines for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of medicines for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. If our promotional activities, including any promotional activities that a contracted sales force may perform on our behalf, fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved medicine from the market, require corrective advertising or a recall or result in the imposition of fines or civil fines, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution by the FDA or other U.S. regulatory agencies, any of which could harm our business. In addition, the distribution of prescription medicines is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription medicine samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs. Further, under the Drug Quality and Security Act, drug manufacturers are subject to a number of requirements, including, medicine identification, tracing and verification, among others, that are designed to detect and remove counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise potentially harmful drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain.
 Where an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both EU and EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU legislation, the details are governed by regulations in individual EU Member States and can differ from one country to another. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with an MA. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. Enforcement of advertising and promotional requirements relating to medicinal products is managed by the competent authorities of EU Member States.
 

The Impact of Brexit. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) took effect on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the TCA, that outlines the trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December 2020, entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, and has been permanently applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the TCA includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the TCA. Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has materially impacted the regulatory regime in the UK with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products. The regulatory changes that are a result of Brexit may also materially impact upon the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products in the EU, should any development or manufacture of these products take place in the UK. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the TCA, the EU and the UK will recognize GMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other party. The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use.
 With respect to marketing authorizations, Great Britain has a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission. Since January 1, 2021, an applicant for a centralized procedure marketing authorization can no longer be established in the UK. Since this date, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures to obtain an MA to market products in the UK. Until December 31, 2023, MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new centralized procedure marketing authorization when determining an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization. From January 1, 2024, a new international recognition process, which will have regard to decisions made by the EMA and certain other regulatory bodies, is anticipated to be in place. The MHRA has also established its own decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized and mutual recognition procedures to be recognized in the UK or Great Britain. Since Brexit, the MHRA has been updating various aspects of the regulatory regime for medicinal products in the UK. These include: introducing the Innovative Licensing and Access Procedure to accelerate the time to market and facilitate patient access for innovative medicinal products; updates to the UK national approval procedure, introducing a 150-day objective for assessing applications for marketing authorizations in the UK, Great Britain and Northern Ireland and a rolling review process for marketing authorization applications (rather than a consolidated full dossier submission). It is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU in the future. The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials and marketing authorization is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). However, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill published in late 2022 which is intended to remove all EU-derived legislation from the UK statute book by the end of 2023, may result in a divergence of approach between the EU and the UK.
 The data exclusivity periods in the UK are currently in line with those in the EU, but the TCA provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future.
 Unlike in the EU, orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is no longer available prior to grant of marketing authorization. Applications for orphan designation are made at the same time as an application for a marketing authorization. The criteria to be granted an orphan medicinal product designation or essentially identical to those in the EU but based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain rather than the EU. It is therefore possible that conditions that were or would have been designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain prior to the end of the Transition Period are or would no longer be and that conditions that were not or would not have been designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.
 

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. As a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” is defined as any remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute may have been violated, and enforcement will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to state that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or to have offered improper inducements to federal health care program beneficiaries to select a particular provider or supplier. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. In addition, where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our activities with physician customers, pharmacies, and patients, as well as our activities pursuant to partnerships with other companies and pursuant to contracts with contract research organizations, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, the ACA specified that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act has been the basis for numerous enforcement actions and settlements by pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies in connection with various alleged financial relationships with customers. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached substantial financial settlements in connection with allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws, as well as physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark Law, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to certain designated health services with which the physician or the physician’s family member has a financial interest and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to the prohibited referral. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including, without limitation, false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and laws analogous to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer, and there are also federal criminal false claims laws.


Separately, there are a number of other fraud and abuse laws that pharmaceutical manufacturers must be mindful of, particularly after a medicine candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States. For example, a federal criminal law enacted as part of, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. There are also federal civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, as well as federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 We are also subject to analogous foreign laws of each of the above federal healthcare laws and foreign jurisdictions may require the implementation of compliance programs, disclosure of any gifts, compensation, or other remuneration provided to health professionals.
 Privacy and Security Laws. We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors. In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or EU GDPR, and the UK’s GDPR, or UK GDPR, impose strict requirements for processing personal data. Under the EU GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.
 Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been dubbed the first “EU GDPR-like” law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households (including health information). The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA significantly modified the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also created a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. For example, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut enacted the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which take effect in 2023.


 “Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws. There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, and make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, a similar federal requirement requires certain manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report to the federal government the following: certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers (including, for example, physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Certain states, such as Massachusetts, also make the reported information publicly available. In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our medicines in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Outside the United States, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, national sunshine rules and regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment, reputational risk and public reprimands.
 Government Price Reporting. For those marketed medicines which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require medicines be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such medicines to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the extent that a branded drug’s price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers). This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increases have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny.
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, some EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many EU Member States have increased the amount of discounts that pharmaceutical companies are required to offer. These efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products onto national markets. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices.


Penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities in the United States or foreign countries could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the state, federal, national or supranational laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, or comparable foreign programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any medicine we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. We maintain a comprehensive healthcare corporate compliance program. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks and risks of regulatory non-compliance cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign privacy, security, sunshine, government price reporting, and fraud laws may prove costly.
 Impact of Healthcare Reform and Recent Public Scrutiny of Drug Pricing on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing. In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our medicines, federal and state lawmakers and regulatory authorities as well as third-party payers are increasingly attempting to regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative medicines and therapies, which has resulted in delays of coverage decisions, barriers for product access including higher patient copays and in certain cases, leads to lower average net selling prices. Further, there is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities. In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country-specific and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU, both of which will put additional pressure on medicine pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future medicine sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our medicines profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs (including a number of proposals pertaining to prescription drugs, specifically), improving quality and/or expanding access.
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the ACA. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. The current administration has made efforts to bolster enrollment in the ACA. For example, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, increasing in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Additionally, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA and the IRA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA’s many different provisions affecting the health system, the IRA, the pharmaceutical sector and our business. We continue to evaluate the effect that such challenges and measures would have on our business.


Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Following the resumption of the sequester, under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Further, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. The FDA also finalized guidance for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code for an FDA-approved drug as part of a process to provide a manufacturer a means to import its drugs that were originally intended to be marketed in and authorized for sale in a foreign country.
 Also at the federal level, recent administrations have used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In the order, the President directed the Federal Trade Commission to ban “pay for delay” patent settlement agreements, and to identify and address any efforts that impede generic or biosimilar competition. The executive order also directed the FDA to continue to work with states and Indian Tribes to develop importation programs in accordance with Section 804 of the FDCA and FDA regulations. The order directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to increase support for generic and biosimilar drugs by improving standards for the interchangeability of biologic products, supporting biosimilar adoption by increasing education, and facilitating the approval of biosimilars by updating and clarifying existing requirements and procedures related to biologics licensing. Finally, the executive order directs HHS to submit a report detailing a comprehensive plan within 45 days to fight high prescription drug prices and reduce the amount that the federal government pays for drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. These principles are government drug price negotiations, promoting increased competition including changes to supply chains and promoting biosimilars and generics and supporting public and private research. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA directs the HHS Secretary to establish a Drug Price Negotiation Program, or Program, to lower prices for certain high-expenditure, single-source prescription drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B and Part D that have been approved by the FDA for at least seven years for prescription drugs and at least 11 years for biologics. Under the Program, the HHS Secretary will publish a list of “selected drugs,” and will then negotiate maximum fair prices with their manufacturers. The Program will be implemented in stages. Beginning in 2026, 10 Medicare Part D “selected drugs” will be subject to price negotiations. By 2029, and in subsequent years thereafter, the number will increase to 20 drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B and Part D. Agreements between HHS and manufacturers will remain in place until a drug or biologic is no longer considered a “selected drug” for negotiation purposes. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs, biological products and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.


Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payers and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. There also has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. There have been several recent state and federal lawmaker inquiries, proposed legislation and enacted legislation as was the case in California designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, by requiring drug companies to notify insurers and government regulators of price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for the increase. There have also been actions to review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, a growing number of states have implemented, or are contemplating implementing, drug affordability boards to establish “allowable rates” for certain high-cost drugs identified by such boards.
 Moreover, in the EEA some countries require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies. This Health Technology Assessment, or HTA process, which is currently governed by the national laws of the individual EU Member States, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. The proposed regulation is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. In December 2021 the HTA Regulation was adopted and entered into force on January 11, 2022. It will apply from 2025.
 In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of medicines, including our medicine candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our medicines.


Irish Law Matters
 As we are an Irish-incorporated company, the following matters of Irish law are relevant to the holders of our ordinary shares.
Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital
 Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions imposed specifically on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act 1992 gives power to the Minister for Finance of Ireland to restrict financial transfers between Ireland and other countries and persons. Financial transfers are broadly defined and include all transfers that would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the member states of the EU. The acquisition or disposal of interests in shares issued by an Irish incorporated company and associated payments falls within this definition. In addition, dividends or payments on redemption or purchase of shares and payments on a liquidation of an Irish incorporated company would fall within this definition. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) also gives the Minister of Finance of Ireland the power to take various measures, including the freezing or seizure of assets, in order to combat terrorism. At present the Financial Transfers Act 1992, certain EU regulations (as implemented into Irish law) and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) prohibit financial transfers involving certain persons and entities associated with the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida organizations, the late Slobodan Milosevic and associated persons, Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Myanmar/Burma, Belarus, certain persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the late Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida, the Taliban of Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iran, Iraq, Côte d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Liberia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Republic of Guinea, Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ukraine, Yemen, Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain known terrorists and terrorist groups, and countries that harbor certain terrorist groups, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland or the Minister of Finance (as applicable).
Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or EU sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.
Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders
Withholding Tax on Dividends. While we have no current plans to pay dividends, dividends on our ordinary shares would generally be subject to Irish Dividend Withholding Tax, or DWT, at the rate of 25 percent, unless an exemption applies.
Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held beneficially through the Depositary Trust Company, or DTC, will not be subject to DWT provided that the address of the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares in the records of the broker is in the United States.
Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held directly (outside of DTC) will not be subject to DWT provided that the shareholder has completed the appropriate Irish DWT form and this form remains valid or provides a Certification of U.S. Tax Residency, or Form IRS 6166. Such shareholders must provide the appropriate Irish DWT form or Form IRS 6166 to our transfer agent at least seven business days before the record date for the first dividend payment to which they are entitled.
If any shareholder who is resident in the United States receives a dividend subject to DWT, he or she should generally be able to make an application for a refund from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on the prescribed form (DWT Claim Form 1).
 While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding tax, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.
 Income Tax on Dividends. A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us.


A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is not entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us. The DWT deducted by us discharges the liability to Irish income tax and to the universal social charge.
 Irish Tax on Capital Gains. A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and does not hold our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholder in Ireland through a branch or agency should not be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of our ordinary shares.
 Capital Acquisitions Tax. Irish capital acquisitions tax, or CAT, is comprised principally of gift tax and inheritance tax. CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our ordinary shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland as our share register must be held in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT.
 CAT is levied at a rate of 33 percent above certain tax-free thresholds. The appropriate tax-free threshold is dependent upon (i) the relationship between the donor and the donee and (ii) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same category of relationship for CAT purposes. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Our shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to whether CAT is creditable or deductible in computing any domestic tax liabilities.
Stamp Duty. Irish stamp duty (if any) may become payable in respect of ordinary share transfers. However, a transfer of our ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired shares through DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. A transfer of our ordinary shares (i) by a seller who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC to any buyer, or (ii) by a seller who holds the ordinary shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired ordinary shares outside of DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1 percent of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares acquired, if greater). The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the buyer or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or for less than market value, all parties to the transfer.
A shareholder who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC may transfer those ordinary shares into DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer into DTC there is no sale of those book-entry interests to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder. Similarly, a shareholder who holds ordinary shares through DTC may transfer those ordinary shares out of DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer, and at the time of the transfer out of DTC there is no sale of those ordinary shares to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder. In order for the share registrar to be satisfied as to the application of this Irish stamp duty treatment where relevant, the shareholder must confirm to us that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) (or vice-versa) as a result of the transfer and there is no agreement for the sale of the related book-entry interest or the ordinary shares or an interest in the ordinary shares, as the case may be, by the shareholder to a third party being contemplated.
 

Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,115 full-time employees. Of our employees as of December 31, 2022, approximately 660 were engaged in development, regulatory and manufacturing activities, approximately 1,005 were engaged in sales and marketing and approximately 450 were engaged in administration, including business development, finance, legal, information systems, facilities and human resources. We consider our employee relations to be good. We are committed to strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment. The health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern.
 Horizon is a perennially award-winning company that has been recognized more than 65 times since 2015 for its workplace and culture. These awards are based on a combination of independent employee feedback and self-reported company data.
 Our human capital management objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer competitive benefits to attract, retain and reward employees and also, through the granting of share-based and cash-based compensation awards, to secure and retain the services of our employees and provide long-term incentives that align the interests of employees with the interests of our shareholders. See “Focus on Employee Benefits” for additional information.
 To help us measure and enhance our employees’ overall engagement and satisfaction with working at Horizon and to determine areas for improvement, we continuously seek their feedback and suggestions through periodic “pulse” surveys. In 2022, we conducted multiple pulse surveys to gain feedback on key topics such as well-being, growth and development, manager effectiveness and employee engagement. Participation in the surveys is high, with rates typically averaging above 90% for our annual surveys – and the results, based on sentiment indication, generally exceed top-quartile industry benchmarks. The favorable results indicate to us that our employees are highly motivated to go above and beyond, that they are highly engaged and that they intend to remain at Horizon, an important consideration given the highly competitive nature of our industry. We attribute some of the successful results of our surveys to the fact that we act on much of the feedback we receive from our employees.
 
Our Core Values
 Our culture is reflected in our three core values: growth, accountability and transparency. Through these core values, our teams of highly engaged employees work to better the lives of patients and the community. This engagement is fostered by our strong emphasis on creating a diverse and inclusive culture that drives how we treat employees and expect employees to treat one another.
Growth: We are a high-growth organization that values innovation, development and evolution. We are fiercely innovating to better our communities, our patients and our employees and place a strong emphasis on personal and professional growth. Employees have access to resources to develop their teams and themselves.
 Accountability: We strive to do what’s right for patients and employees through quality decisions and owning successes and failures. Employees hold each other accountable to make quality decisions that keep our company moving forward to meet the needs of patients.
 Transparency: We value the collaboration that is made possible by employees trusting each other to tackle tough challenges and difficult conversations. We are courageous in our decision making, knowing it's necessary to drive our business forward.
 We continuously strive to maintain an engaged workforce that is ready to serve patients and healthcare providers. To that end, employee development is central to how we improve every day. All our employees are encouraged to participate in “Growing Your Career at Horizon,” a series of learning events focused on providing guidance around leadership development. Recently – and to support continuous improvement on key culture initiatives – these events have focused on such topics as “inclusive conversations,” “strategic mindset” and “managing ambiguity.” Additionally, all our employees have unlimited and seamless access to myriad online learning resources. These resources are valuable tools that empower employees to further their professional development while contributing to the growth of our company.
As employees progress in their careers, additional opportunities become available to them, including robust programs intended to grow early career professionals, people managers and future enterprise leaders.
Focus on Employee Benefits
At the center of our employee experience is how we reward our employees for the impact they create. Our competitive benefits include annual equity and cash incentive plans, retirement benefits and an employee share purchase plan. In addition, we absorb most of the costs for employee medical insurance plans. We also offer a wide variety of benefits that support working families. This includes our parental and caregiver programs. As part of these programs, all caregivers have flexible paid options to care for the needs of their families. These benefits are paid at 100 percent salary. For employees pursuing adoption or surrogacy as a path to parenthood, we offer competitive reimbursement for costs associated with the legal adoption of a child or expenses incurred when using a surrogate.
 We offer all full-time employees a “Make it Personal” account, which provides $500 annually for certain employee personal expenses including student loan repayment, contributions to college savings plans, donations to charitable organizations, health club memberships or purchases of personal health equipment or home office equipment. In addition, all employees have access to an annual “Make it Personal” day. This is an additional 8 hours of paid time off that employees can use to participate in something meaningful or personal to them – from volunteering at a local charity to spending time caring for a loved one.
 We also offer competitive educational benefits for our employees and families. We value and encourage continued growth and development of our employees and their families. To support educational goals, we offer several programs to help offset the financial burden of college expenses, including tuition reimbursement, an executive scholarship award for graduate school and scholarships for dependents of our employees.
 Our Commitment to Inclusion and Diversity
 We are committed to maintaining a workplace free of discrimination, harassment, intimidation or inappropriate conduct based on sex/gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation and/or any other category protected by law. We also provide equal opportunity in employment to all employees and applicants. Equal opportunity rights are applicable to recruitment, hiring, employment and employment-related decisions. In 2020, we introduced RiSE, a strategic program to further embed inclusion, diversity, equity and allyship into the organization. Through RiSE, over 20 volunteer employee leaders work together, leading nine diverse working groups, to enhance and promote our approach to inclusive recruitment, professional development, community involvement, culturally responsive benefits, patient equity and building the overall organizational inclusive culture.
 Our commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity and allyship is evidenced from the top down. Our chief executive officer, or CEO, Timothy P. Walbert, was one of the first signatories to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge. Our top leaders have gone through in-depth assessments to determine their inclusive leadership capabilities, with coaching available for leaders who want to enhance their skillsets in these areas.
 We continued to demonstrate gender and ethnicity pay equity, according to a second study conducted in 2021 by a leading third-party compensation consulting firm. The study was a follow-on study to a 2019 study that found no pay discrepancy among men, women and those of different ethnic backgrounds. Both studies analyzed employee demographic and pay data and showed that we provide equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender or ethnicity. We maintained our gender and ethnicity pay equity after significant growth in the three years since the first study. In addition, our percentage of female employees is over 50 percent and above industry standards. 


We continue to receive multiple workplace recognitions, which we believe is evidence of our commitment to employee engagement. In 2022, we received multiple well-known published workplace rankings, including several diversity-related workplace awards:
