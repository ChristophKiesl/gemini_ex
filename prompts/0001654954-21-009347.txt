  General
  
 Insignia Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Minnesota in 1990. We are a leading provider of in-store and digital advertising solutions to consumer-packaged goods (“CPG”) manufacturers, retailers, shopper marketing agencies and brokerages (“clients”). We believe our products and services are attractive to our clients because of our speed to market, ability to customize our solutions down to store level and the results our solutions deliver. Our leadership and employees have extensive industry knowledge, including direct experience through former positions at CPG manufacturers and retailers. We provide marketing solutions to CPG manufacturers spanning from some of the largest multinationals to new and emerging brands.
  
  For retailers and CPG manufacturers working in an environment that is tighter, more competitive, and more complex every day, Insignia positions itself as the shopper marketing ally that combines best-in-class execution with imagination, responsiveness, and hunger to help move business forward. We focus on relationships with our clients and installation and print production vendors (“execution partners”) as we believe they are our future. These relationships are built with our brand-led, retailer centric mindset, our ability to be nimble and flexible to the ever-changing industry landscape and by delivering superior customer service that our clients deserve. During 2020, our in-store solutions were executed in retailers spanning from some of the largest national retailers to regional US wholesalers and independents who are leaders in their respective channels and geographies.
  
  Our relationships with shopper marketing agencies and brokerages continue to grow through our agility, responsiveness, custom production and execution capabilities, and our overall customer service in responding to their needs.
  
 Historically, our primary solution has been in-store signage, specifically Point-Of-Purchase Services (POPS®). The Insignia POPS solution is a national, account-specific, shelf-edge advertising and promotion tactic. External and internal testing has validated the solution can deliver incremental sales for the featured brand. Participation in the POPS solution allows CPG manufacturers to deliver vital product information to consumers at the point-of-purchase, and to leverage the local retailer brand and store-specific prices to provide an innovative “call to action” that draws attention to the featured brand and triggers a purchase decision. CPG manufactures benefit from our nimble executional capabilities, which include short lead times, in-house graphic design capabilities and post-program analytics.
  
  Over the past several years, we developed and now offer an expanded portfolio of solutions including on-pack, merchandising and digital solutions in addition to our core business. Our expanded portfolio allows us to meet the needs of CPG manufacturers, retailers and their agents as their business strategies evolve behind an ever-changing retail landscape. With our diversification of business, we now recognize over 50% of our revenue from these recently created solutions.
  
  We continue to enhance our ability to be nimble and flexible by focusing and streamlining our operations. In the last half of 2020, we sold our custom print business and outsourced most of our printing and IT operations. In the first half of 2021, we will relocate our headquarters and operations to much smaller, more efficient leased spaces.
  
  Effective December 31, 2020, we implemented a seven-for-one reverse stock split. As a result of the reverse stock split, at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the effective date, every seven shares of common stock then issued and outstanding automatically were combined into one share of common stock, with no change in par value per share. No fractional shares were outstanding following the reverse stock split and any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were aggregated and sold by our transfer agent. The total number of shares we are authorized to issue was reduced to 5,714,285 in proportion to the reverse stock split. All references to share and per share amounts included in this annual report on Form 10-K have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse split.
  
 The Company’s internet address is www.insigniasystems.com. The Company makes all the reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available free of charge on its website. The Company’s website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of reports can also be obtained free of charge by requesting them from Insignia Systems, Inc. Our mailing address effective March 22, 2021 will be 7308 Aspen Lane North, Suite 153, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55428; telephone 763-392-6200.

  Industry and Market Background
  
 Our industry continues to rapidly evolve in several ways:
  
  1. 
 Brand loyalty: consumer brand loyalty is shifting from established CPG manufacturers to emerging brands, who often have distribution outside our traditional syndicated in-store network and are looking for solutions to help them be discovered.

 
  2. 
 Retailer fragmentation: consumer habits are driving retailer fragmentation, including the growth of e-commerce and surrogate shoppers, as a result CPG manufacturers are diversifying their marketing dollars across an omnichannel environment.

 
  3. 
 Financial justification: CPG manufacturers are increasingly focused on top and bottom-line financial metrics, which drives increased pressure to generate positive advertising return on investments and by working with companies that can execute programs.

 
  4. 
 Competition shift: Digital advertising spend is reducing spend on traditional media, including in-store advertising, driving increased competition from direct competitors, retailer led marketing programs, and digital media companies.

 
 Despite rapid growth in e-commerce, both retailers and CPG manufacturers are actively seeking to grow their brands in physical stores. During 2020, we executed programs for several brands who started as direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands and are launching in physical stores. On the retail side, many of the top US retailers have either opened new stores, introduced new formats, or invested heavily in major store renovations. As a result, retailers are actively seeking solutions that can help drive traffic into the store and build loyalty with their shoppers. Retailers are seeking companies with our capabilities and experience to help build in-store solutions that inspire, educate and ultimately convert active shoppers while they are shopping. Retailers are continuing to seek ways to connect their online strategies with their in-store strategies to build shopper loyalty and to develop solutions to enhance the shopper’s in-store experience. CPG manufacturers are increasingly looking for opportunities to reinforce their brand equity as close as possible to the point of purchase or to expand the number of locations where they are offered in store to ensure they are selected over competition. We believe emerging brands are looking for ways to get discovered and tell shoppers their story. These trends along with new developments in shopper analytics are opening opportunities for innovative companies to develop new products and new ways of helping retailers and brands connect with shoppers. We are usually engaged as part of an overall, mixed-media, brand marketing campaign. 
  
  Product Solutions
  
 Since the Company’s inception in 1990, we have worked closely with CPG manufacturers and retailers to understand their evolving needs and introduce solutions that help them achieve their business strategies. Over most of the past decade, our core product has been in-store signage solutions, namely the Insignia Point-of Purchase Services (POPS®). Over the past several years, our net sales from sign solutions have declined due to competitive pressures while our non-POPS solutions have significantly expanded as we have developed our portfolio to more holistically meet the needs of our clients and execution partners. For example, our in-store signage solutions represented approximately 57% of our total net sales for 2020, compared to 83% of our total net sales in 2018.
  
  1. 
 Our In-Store Signage Solutions, which include POPS signs, help brands achieve a variety of objectives that include awareness and sales lift. The in-store signage solutions are placed perpendicular to the shelf and are designed to attract the attention of the shopper even before they arrive in front of the shelf to consider the purchase of a product. Our POPS signs offer engaging creative along with our unique ability to include retailer logo and price helps convert the shopper from considering a product into purchasing the product.

 
  ● 
 Our customers have typically averaged a 3:1 return on investment with our in-store POPS signage solution driven by the power of retailer endorsement and price inclusion on the signs.

 
  ● 
 CPG manufacturers pay marketing program rates based upon the directed number of cycles and retailer/store count. We collect and organize data from the CPG manufacturers and participating retailers, design and have the signage printed, and deliver signage to specified retailers. Depending on the agreement with the retailer, either a third-party professional installer or store personnel use placement instructions to install the signage at the shelf.

  2. 
 Our Merchandising Solutions are designed to help brands get discovered, build awareness and drive impulse purchases via a secondary or often permanent placement of their products. Our merchandising solutions include a variety of creative corrugate displays, side caps, free standing shippers and full customized end-cap solutions that brands leverage to grow their sales.

 
  3. 
 Our On-Pack Solutions appear on the individual product package and are designed to drive awareness, impulse purchases and capture market share within a very short period. On-pack solutions include BoxTalkTM, coupons, recipes, and cross-promotions.

 
  4. 
 Our Digital Solutions consist of mobile programmatic advertising. Most CPG manufacturers are relying on digital advertising for promoting their products to consumers. We have invested in our proprietary targeting process, that brings product, store and shopper data together to identify consumers with the strongest propensity to buy. Our innovative targeting approach allows brands to cast a wider net in identifying potential buyers of their product by focusing on relevant attributes for a specific brand. As part of an integrated marketing plan, we can develop and execute digital advertising and in-store marketing in cadence with brand plans and expectations.

 
  Marketing and Sales
  
 Our highly skilled direct sales and marketing teams are a major asset for the organization with their deep knowledge of CPG manufacturers and retailers. Our sales organization is split into two separate groups:
  
  1. 
 Sales to CPG manufacturers. This group is dedicated to understanding the challenges faced by both large established brands and small emerging brands and developing solutions that address their needs.

 
  2. 
 Sales to retailers. This group is responsible for understanding each retailer’s unique needs and to build solutions to address them.

 
 Our marketing is focused on the following:
  
  ● 
 Increasing awareness of our corporate brand;

 
  ● 
 Analyzing the effectiveness of executed offerings; and

 
  ● 
 Developing and commercializing new and existing solutions.

 
 Our in-store signage solutions are available for sale into a network of retailers that is managed and maintained through direct relationships, or can be sold to certain retailers in the Mass Merchant Channel.
  
 During each of the last two most recently completed fiscal years, foreign sales accounted for less than 1% of total net sales each year. We expect sales to foreign distributors will remain less than 1% of total net sales in 2021.
  
  Competition
  
 We have faced increasingly intense competition for the marketing expenditures of CPG manufacturers for in-store signage. We have observed increased competition in growing and maintaining our network of retailers into which we are authorized to sell solutions as competitors continue to purchase new or extend exclusive arrangements with retailers for that purpose. We are party to an agreement with News America that entitles us to opportunities to sell signs with price in specific parts of News America’s retail network through April 2021, but we have experienced limited success gaining additional access to News America’s retail network. We are currently party to legal proceedings involving News Corporation, News America Marketing FSI L.L.C., and News America Marketing In-Store Services L.L.C. (collectively, “News America”). The lawsuit is described further in Item 3 of Part I of this report.
  
 Our solutions are also subject to increasing pressures from alternatives to traditional in-store signage, including digital and merchandising solutions offered by competitors including Vestcom, Menasha, West Rock, Valassis Digital and Quotient.

 We believe our primary competitive strengths include:
 
  ● 
 Best-in-class execution across our portfolio product solutions;


  ● 
 Broad client-base of CPG manufacturers inclusive of large Fortune 500 companies, and emerging start-ups;


  ● 
 Managing and providing turn-key access to a national network of retailers;


  ● 
 Imagination, responsiveness and hunger to help move our clients’ business forward; and


  ● 
 Our speed to market on program execution.

 Service and Solution Development

Over the past several years, we have significantly expanded our offered solutions and have developed a portfolio designed to more holistically meet the needs of our clients and execution partners.
 Business Plan
  
 Our strategic plan, seeks to differentiate Insignia from our competition, situate Insignia for growth within our industry and better insulate Insignia to competitive response through our overall portfolio diversification. The strategic plan consists of:
  
  1. 
 Optimize our Core. Streamline and simplify day-to-day operations and execution. In the second half of 2020, we outsourced most of our printing and information technology operations.

 
  2. 
 Accelerate Innovation. Double down on our non-POPS solutions and invest in our growth.

 
  3. 
 Amplify Digital. Expand existing capabilities to capture a greater share of the market.

 
  4. 
 Deliver Corporate Rebrand. Launch new corporate branding and positioning to grow overall awareness and appeal.

 
  5. 
 Invest in our Future. Continue to recruit and retain top talent, invest in training and development and strengthening our capabilities.

 
 Our strategic plan acknowledges the challenges and opportunities we face within our industry and given the rapid change in retail in the current environment, we continue to be faced with risk of short-to-intermediate term volatility in our operating and financial performance.
  
   Customers
  
 We are a leading provider of in-store and digital advertising solutions to our clients. These solutions help our clients connect, engage and build better relationships with their consumers to increase awareness, trial, sales and loyalty. Many of these CPG manufacturers are fast moving brands with products that would be found in grocery, mass and drug channels.

 During 2020, one CPG manufacturer accounted for 14% of our total net sales. During 2019, two CPG manufacturers accounted for 13% and 12%, respectively, of our total net sales. At December 31, 2020, two CPG manufacturers represented 17% and 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively. At December 31, 2019, four CPG manufacturers represented 17%, 12%, 12% and 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively.
  
 Our sales historically have fluctuated from period to period, primarily because of:
  
  ● 
 CPG manufacturer determinations to purchase solutions from us versus competitor solutions;

  ● 
 Promotional timing and new product launches by CPG manufacturers;

  ● 
 CPG manufacturer budget fluctuations and amounts allocated to in-store or digital tactics vs. other tactics;

  ● 
 Quantity and quality of retailer locations into which we are authorized to execute our in-store solutions;

  ● 
 New solution acceptance by CPG manufacturers and retailers; and

  ● 
 Changes in the salability and breadth of our retailer network.

 
  Environmental Matters
  
 We believe our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations within the jurisdictions in which we operate. The costs and effects of compliance with these regulations have not been, and are not expected to become material.
 Human Capital Resources and Management
  
  We had 40 employees, of which 39 were full-time employees, as of March 8, 2021. We believe relationships are our focus and our future, and that begins with our own team. We believe in creating an environment where our employees have opportunities to grow and develop professionally and a work environment that employees are proud to be a part of.
  
  ●
Employee Engagement. We believe in regular engagement with our full team, whether that is starting off our week together in our Monday Huddle meetings, celebrating nominated employees for quarterly recognition or enjoying events our Employee Engagement committee plans. We also take to heart our employees’ feedback and concerns and leverage this to help enhance our employee experience promoting retention and overall success of our organization.

 
  ●
Talent Development. We have all our employees participate in annual development plans where we focus on both employee strengths and opportunities. 22% of our employees in 2020 advanced their careers with earned promotions based on their development and performance. Based on our employee needs we can provide them a wide range of development opportunities both formal and informal. As an example, in 2020, we had three of our Senior Directors complete their Six Sigma Training to help improve our production and execution processes.

 
  ●
Focus on Safety. The safety of our employees is a priority. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, that included giving the majority of our employees the flexibility to work from home.

 
  ●
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We recognize that our best performance comes when we have a team built off of diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2020, we reemphasized our focus when we were recognized from Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership for our diversity both in our boardroom and our executive leadership team. In addition, we have added Juneteenth as a recognized paid holiday for employees after the events of George Floyd and provided resources to our employees to educate themselves on racial prejudices.

   
  ●
Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, these programs, can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, and on-site services.
