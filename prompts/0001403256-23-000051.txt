Item 1. Business
Business Description 
Sculptor Capital is a leading institutional alternative asset manager, with approximately $35.9 billion in Assets Under Management as of February 1, 2023 and a global presence with offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. We provide asset management services and investment products across Multi-Strategy, Credit, and Real Estate. We serve our global client base through our commingled funds, separate accounts, and specialized products. Our capabilities span all major geographies and asset classes. Our approach to asset management is based on the same fundamental elements that we have employed since Sculptor Capital was founded in 1994. Our distinctive investment process seeks to generate attractive and consistent risk-adjusted returns across market cycles through a combination of fundamental bottom-up research, a high degree of flexibility, a collaborative team, and integrated risk management. We currently serve a diverse global investor base with investment solutions across core capabilities in multi-strategy funds, dedicated credit funds, including opportunistic credit funds and Institutional Credit Strategies products and real estate funds. We also create value by expanding our product offering and enhancing our distribution channels.
Multi-Strategy - Our multi-strategy funds invest globally in high-conviction investment ideas across the depth and breadth of global equity, credit and convertible securities and derivatives markets with a mandate to generate strong and consistent risk-adjusted returns across market cycles with a focus on risk management and capital preservation. Our investment strategy benefits from flexible and dynamic capital allocations to the most attractive individual investment opportunities. The strategy primarily focuses on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to the direction of broader financial markets. Through detailed, bottoms-up fundamental analysis and due diligence, we aim to identify investment opportunities where intermediate or long-term value is obscured by attributes such as complexity, corporate events, technical dislocations, or market misunderstandings. Our multi-strategy funds allocate capital across strategies and geographies opportunistically based on market conditions, with no predetermined capital allocations by strategy or asset class. Our investment strategies include Corporate Credit, Structured Credit, Convertible & Derivative Arbitrage, Merger Arbitrage, and Fundamental Equities. 
Credit - Our credit platform comprises both opportunistic credit and Institutional Credit Strategies. Opportunistic credit focuses on global corporate, structured and private credit markets, with the ability to source both undervalued and dislocated assets in times of market distress and pursue more complex process-driven opportunities during periods of relative calm. This includes investments in distressed businesses, restructurings and bankruptcies. Our investment proposition is a result of our disciplined underwriting of credit fundamentals, a value creation process generally focused on idiosyncratic situations that are less correlated to markets and having a thorough understanding of the market environment that permits the nimble flow of capital across security types dependent on the spread environment. Institutional Credit Strategies invests in performing credit via leveraged loans, high yield bonds, private financing and investment-grade credit and serves clients through CLOs, collateralized bond obligations (“CBOs”), aviation securitizations, commingled products and customized solutions.
Real Estate - Our real estate funds invest in opportunistic real estate private equity and real estate credit in both North America and Europe. Our opportunistic investment approach generates attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to positioning within the capital structure. Our Real Estate business adopts a broader investment mandate than most fund managers, having invested in 28 different traditional and non-traditional asset classes across the debt / equity spectrum. Our business emphasizes preservation of capital and downside protection by seeking to generate attractive current returns through interest income and fees. The real estate funds focus on proprietary sourcing, discretion in deal selection, thorough due diligence, intensive asset management, multiple defined exit strategies and structured downside protection to seek and manage investments. 
Our Assets Under Management 
Our primary sources of revenues are management fees, which are primarily based on the amount of our Assets Under Management, and incentive income, which is based on the investment performance of our funds. Accordingly, for any given 
period, our revenues will be driven by the combination of Assets Under Management and the investment performance of our funds. Our Assets Under Management are a function of the capital that is allocated to us by the investors in our funds and the investment performance of our funds. For additional information regarding Assets Under Management, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Managing Business Performance”
Overview of Our Funds
Multi-Strategy
As of December 31, 2022, Assets Under Management in our multi-strategy funds totaled approximately $9.2 billion, or 25% of our total Assets Under Management. These funds seek to consistently generate strong risk-adjusted returns across market cycles with a focus on risk management and capital preservation. We aim to achieve these objectives by investing in high-conviction investment ideas across asset classes, regions and strategies, with a primary focus on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to direction of broader financial markets. Our investment strategy seeks to benefit from flexible and dynamic capital allocations to the most attractive individual investment opportunities. Sculptor’s investment process combines expert bottom-up fundamental analysis, a dynamic approach to portfolio construction, and a sophisticated and fully integrated risk management effort. The primary investment strategies we employ in our multi-strategy funds include the following:
•Corporate Credit takes an opportunistic approach to corporate credit investing and includes investments in undervalued or dislocated securities and pursuing process-driven investments including investments in complex distressed businesses, restructurings and bankruptcies. We take a fundamental investment approach to identify investments that may be undervalued due to complexity, market inefficiencies or other investors’ lack of scale, capability or mandate to pursue these investments. Our ability to participate in many of these types of investments is a direct function of our presence in the markets, scale, experience and reputation as a counterparty. 
•Structured Credit invests in a wide breadth of structured products, with a primary focus in several credit categories, including residential, commercial, corporate, and consumer credit, among others. This strategy aims to provide idiosyncratic and highly differentiated returns through process-driven investments in which value can be extracted through active rights enforcement, litigation, liquidation or restructuring. Our scale, propriety sourcing, collateral underwriting, and ability to analyze complex structures provides a competitive advantage. The strategy also invests in opportunities in areas such as CLO mezzanine debt, CMBS and ABS, pursuing positions that exploit market inefficiencies, misunderstandings and technical factors. 
•Convertible and Derivative Arbitrage seeks to exploit the price discrepancies between certain convertible bonds and derivative securities and the underlying equity or other securities to generate strong, stable, and uncorrelated returns. We explore opportunities in traditional convertible arbitrage, mandatory convertible investments, short convertible strategies and relative value opportunities. Within this strategy, we also opportunistically invest in third party SPACs.
•Merger Arbitrage pursues a wide array of event-driven situations, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe. In addition to more-traditional merger arbitrage, the strategy also invests in favorably skewed risk/ reward opportunities in less-followed corporate actions, including exchange offers, unannounced deals, spin-offs, split-offs and hostile cross-border situations with regulatory and geopolitical complexity. Our flexible approach allows us to pursue strategies on a risk-adjusted basis and size them accordingly.
•Fundamental Equities seeks to generate returns through concentrated positions, both long and short, across global equity markets. The strategy employs a rigorous fundamental research process that draws on resources and knowledge from across the firm to generate investment ideas with medium to long-term time horizons. Our primary focus for long investments is situations where value is being obscured for an attributable reason with a path to value realization. Short positions generally focus on overvalued companies where earnings expectations in the future will be reduced as a result of secular challenges, cyclical headwinds, or a misjudgment of the fundamental earnings power of a business. The strategy’s best-ideas framework is complemented with dynamic hedging at the portfolio level to allow few constraints on net directional exposure. 
The Sculptor Master Fund, our global multi-strategy fund, invests in high-conviction investment ideas across asset classes, regions and strategies, with a primary focus on idiosyncratic opportunities where return drivers are less sensitive to the direction of broader financial markets. The key limitations we consider when selecting and sizing investments are related to our fundamental and quantitative view on the risk/reward, liquidity and availability of the specific investment under evaluation. Sculptor Master Fund generally employs every strategy and geography in which our funds invest and constituted approximately 25% of our Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2022. The investment performance for our other funds may vary from those of the Sculptor Master Fund, and that variance may be material.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the net annualized return, volatility and Sharpe Ratio of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite (as defined below), the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, MSCI World Index and Balanced US 60/40 Index.

_______________
(1)The returns shown represent the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise the Sculptor Master Fund since the inception of the Sculptor Master Fund on January 1, 1998, and are calculated using the total return of all feeder funds net of all fees and expenses and include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Since our inception on April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, we managed other accounts in a substantially similar manner to the Sculptor Master Fund, and in accordance with our same multi-strategy mandate that was not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion (the “Multi-Strategy Accounts”). The presentation of historical performance information in this table includes the performance of the Multi-Strategy Accounts for those periods prior to January 1, 1998. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such Multi-Strategy Accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts and include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the Multi-Strategy Accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the Sculptor Master Fund. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies we followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion and has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future. We refer collectively to the combined returns of the Sculptor Master Fund and Multi-Strategy Accounts as the “Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite.” We believe that the inclusion of the historical performance of the Multi-Strategy Accounts provides a more complete representation of our historical multi-strategy performance. The returns exclude realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to currency hedging specific to certain investors investing in Sculptor Master Fund in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The returns for the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite exclude Special Investments. Special Investments in the Sculptor Master Fund are held by investors representing a small percentage of Assets Under Management in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the net returns of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite were (13.3)%, 2.8%, 4.1%, and 5.3% for the trailing one, three, five, and ten year periods, respectively; and 10.4% since the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite inception.
(2)These comparisons show the returns of the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index (HFRIFWI), the MSCI World Index (GDDLWI) and the Balanced US 60/40 Index (VBINX US Equity) and (collectively, the “Broader Market Indices”) against the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite. These comparisons are intended solely for illustrative purposes to show a historical comparison of the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite to the broader equity markets, as represented by the Broader Market Indices, and should not be considered as an indication of how the Sculptor Master Fund or the feeder funds will perform relative to the Broader Market Indices in the future. The Broader Market Indices are not performance benchmarks of the Sculptor Master Fund or the feeder 
funds. Neither the Sculptor Master Fund nor the feeder funds are managed to correlate in any way with the returns or composition of the Broader Market Indices, which are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest in an unmanaged index. You should not assume that there is any material overlap between the securities underlying the Sculptor Multi-Strategy Composite and those that comprise the Broader Market Indices. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index is a global equal-weighted index of over 2,000 single-manager funds that report to the HFR Database. Constituent funds report monthly, net of all fees, performance in U.S. dollar and have a minimum of $50.0 million under management or a twelve (12) month track record of active performance. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index does not include Funds of Hedge Funds. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index owned and maintained by MSCI Inc. that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The Balanced US 60/40 Index is a Vanguard Fund weighted index that invests roughly 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds by tracking the performance of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index. Returns of the Broader Market Indices have not been reduced by fees and expenses associated with investing in securities and include the reinvestment of dividends.
(3)Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of volatility that measures the fluctuation of the monthly rates of return against the average return.
(4)Sharpe Ratio represents a measure of the risk-adjusted return of the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable, and dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the applicable returns. The risk-free rate of return used in computing the Sharpe Ratio is the one-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate compounded monthly throughout the periods presented.
Credit
As of December 31, 2022, we managed approximately $22.3 billion of Assets Under Management in our dedicated credit funds, or 62% of our total Assets Under Management. Our dedicated credit funds comprise our opportunistic credit funds and Institutional Credit Strategies products.

(1)The returns for the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund exclude Special Investments. Special Investments in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund are held by investors representing a small percentage of Assets Under Management in the fund. Inclusive of these Special Investments, the net returns of the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund were (3.8)%, 3.5%, 3.6%, and 6.7% for the trailing one, three, five, and ten year periods, respectively; and 8.6% since the fund inception.
(2)Performance presented is for the opportunistic credit strategies in the Customized Credit Focused Platform. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 94% of the invested capital in the Customized Credit Focused Platform is invested in the Platform’s opportunistic credit strategies. Weighted Average Returns reflect the total profit & loss divided by the weighted average capital base, which represents net asset value plus net contributions (distributions) for the period.
(3)These comparisons show the returns of the BAML Global High Yield (“HW00”) and HFRX Fixed Income Credit Index (“HFRXFIC”). The BAML Global High Yield Index tracks the performance of USD, CAD, GBP and EUR denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the major domestic or Eurobond markets. The HFRX Fixed Income Credit Index is a credit Index which includes strategies with exposure to credit across a broad continuum of credit sub-strategies, including Corporate, Sovereign, Distressed, Convertible, Asset Backed, Capital Structure Arbitrage, Multi-Strategy and other Relative Value and Event Driven sub-strategies. Investment thesis across all strategies is predicated on realization of a valuation discrepancy between the related credit instruments. Strategies may also include and utilize equity securities, credit derivatives, government fixed income, commodities, currencies or other hybrid securities. The methodology is based on defined and predetermined rules and objective criteria to select and rebalance components to maximize representation of the Hedge Fund Universe.
(4)Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of volatility that measures the fluctuation of the monthly rates of return against the average return.
(5)Sharpe Ratio represents a measure of the risk-adjusted return of the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the composite returns, or benchmark returns, as applicable, and dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the applicable returns. The risk-free rate of return used in computing the Sharpe Ratio is the one-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate compounded monthly throughout the periods presented.
Opportunistic Credit Funds
As of December 31, 2022, we managed approximately $6.0 billion of Assets Under Management in our opportunistic credit funds. These products seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally. As of December 31, 2022, Assets Under Management in the Sculptor Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, totaled $1.7 billion, and Assets Under Management in the Customized Credit Focused Platform totaled $3.8 billion. The remainder of the Assets Under Management in our opportunistic credit products was made up of various open-end and closed-end funds, as well as customized solutions structured to meet our fund investors’ needs. 
Institutional Credit Strategies 
As of December 31, 2022, we managed approximately $16.3 billion of Assets Under Management in our Institutional Credit Strategies products. Institutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs, aircraft securitization vehicles, CBOs, structured alternative investment solutions, commingled products and other customized solutions for clients. The Institutional Credit Strategies platform’s fundamental approach is built on capital preservation and rigorous assessment of relative value, proactive portfolio management combined with diversification, cross asset collaboration and integrated risk management.
Real Estate
As of December 31, 2022, we managed approximately $4.5 billion of Assets Under Management in our real estate funds, or 13% of our total Assets Under Management. Our real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets. We seek to build portfolios that are balanced between traditional and non-traditional asset classes, employing moderate leverage, using creative structures and targeting high cash-on-cash returns. Our opportunistic investment approach generates attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to positioning within the capital structure combined with a disciplined risk assessment process. These funds seek to diversify investments across geography, asset types and transaction structures to actively balance the portfolios within each of the funds. Our Real Estate business adopts a broader investment mandate than most fund managers, having invested in 28 different traditional and non-traditional asset classes across the debt/equity spectrum. Our two primary fund series are equity and credit opportunity funds (Sculptor Real Estate and Sculptor Real Estate Credit, respectively), and we also manage a SPAC. As of December 31, 2022, our real estate funds have invested across 28 different real estate asset classes with 72% of the capital deployed in non-traditional asset classes.
Over time, and in response to changing investment environments, asset pricing bubbles, and significant capital flows driving valuations past peak levels for the traditional asset classes in the major real estate markets, we developed significant experience and capabilities in more non-traditional asset classes. As a result we adopted a broad investment mandate, investing across traditional and niche asset classes along the entire real estate and real estate debt spectrum. Our real estate credit strategy is focused on distressed debt recapitalizations, certain construction lending opportunities, inefficiencies in non-traditional asset classes and attractive risk-adjusted returns in certain sectors with strong fundamentals.
The below table presents returns for select real estate funds:

Life-to-Date Performance (as of December 31, 2022) | Fund I | Fund II | Fund III | Credit Fund I
Gross | 25.5% | 32.9% | 30.3% | 18.3% 
Net | 16.1% | 21.7% | 21.0% | 12.9% 

 The performance tables provided throughout this “Overview of Our Funds” section are for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the future results of our funds. There can be no assurance that any fund will achieve comparable results. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—An investment in our Class A Shares is not an alternative to an investment in any of our funds, and the returns of our funds should not be considered as indicative of any returns expected on our Class A Shares, although poor investment performance of, or lack of capital flows into, the funds we manage could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and, therefore, the returns on our Class A Shares.” 
Investment and Risk Management Process 
Our extensive experience and consistent approach to investing and risk management are an essential part of our strong performance history. Risk management is a core element of our investment philosophy and process and plays a crucial role in the strategy and operations of our business. Our investment and risk management processes benefit from our dedicated and experienced teams operating out of our offices worldwide.
Our approach to investing and managing risk is defined by certain common elements: 
•Proactive risk management is built on the principles of constant vigilance, frequent dialogue, and continuous improvement. We constantly monitor risk and have instituted a formal and consistent process to disseminate information, conduct informed debate, and take proactive or responsive action across our portfolios. Technology is at the core of Sculptor’s risk management efforts, and we leverage our broad capabilities to develop proprietary solutions that fit the exact specifications of our investment approach. In addition to our formalized process, we conduct custom studies and optimizations for various groups on an as-needed, ad hoc basis such as bespoke hedge solutions, pre-trade what-if analysis, and portfolio rebalance alternatives.
•Preservation of capital. Preservation of capital is our top priority and guiding factor in our effort to deliver attractive returns to fund investors. Our goal is to preserve capital during periods of market decline and generate competitive investment performance in rising markets. We use sophisticated risk tools and active portfolio management to govern exposures to market and other risk factors. We adhere strictly to each fund’s mandate and provisions with respect to leverage. We are knowledgeable about the risks of fund leverage, respectful of its limits, and judicious in our application.
•Dynamic capital allocation. We allocate to individual investments based on a thorough analysis of the risk/reward for each opportunity under consideration and the investment objectives for each of our funds. This results in an overall capital allocation that is constantly fine-tuned based on our best ideas at each point in time.
•Expertise across strategies and geographies. The considerable expertise, tenure and collaboration among our diverse interdisciplinary investment team forms the basis of our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our fund investors. We have fostered a culture that allows us to analyze and scrutinize investment opportunities on a firm-wide basis, focusing on the best ideas and opportunities available.
Our Fund Investors
We focus on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with a global base of institutional investors, which includes many of the largest, most sophisticated investors in the world. Excluding our securitization vehicles within Institutional Credit Strategies products, we currently have over 1,300 investors in our funds, including pensions, sovereign wealth and corporates, high net worth and family office, fund-of-funds, and foundations and endowments. Over 70% of our clients have been partnering with us for over a decade. We build transparent, thoughtful, and enduring partnerships with our investors that are grounded in a deep understanding of their objectives and expectations. Our investors value our funds’ consistent performance history, our global investing expertise, our diverse investment strategies and our ability to develop investment capabilities in areas where we see opportunities evolve. As a result, a number of our fund investors invest in more than one of our funds.
Investments by our executive managing directors and employees collectively comprised approximately 2% of our total Assets Under Management as of January 1, 2023. The single largest unaffiliated investor in our funds accounted for approximately 19% of our total Assets Under Management as of January 1, 2023, and the top five unaffiliated fund investors accounted for approximately 43%. Approximately 28% of our Assets Under Management were from investors from outside North America as of January 1, 2023. These percentages, as well as those presented in the chart below, exclude Assets Under Management in our securitization vehicles, which are held by various types of investors. 
The following chart presents the composition of our fund investors by type across our funds as of January 1, 2023:
Competitive Environment
The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect that it will remain so. We compete globally and regionally with other investment managers, including hedge funds, public and private investment firms, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and other CLO issuers, real estate development companies, business development companies, investment banks and other financial institutions worldwide. We compete for both investors in our funds and attractive investment opportunities based on a number of factors, including investment performance, brand recognition, business reputation, pricing, innovation, the quality of services we provide to the investors in our funds, the range of products we offer, and our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals in all aspects of our business while managing our operating costs. We face competitors that are larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Certain of our competitors may continue to raise capital to pursue investment strategies that may be similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances or make different risk assessments than we do, or may have lower return thresholds, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish broader networks of business relationships. They may also be subject to different regulatory requirements, which may give them greater flexibility to pursue investment opportunities or attract new capital to their funds. For additional information regarding the competitive risks that we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competitive pressures in the asset management business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.”
Competitive Strengths
Sculptor Capital is built on certain distinct fundamental elements that we believe are differentiating competitive strengths. We view these elements as a crucial part of our efforts to generate attractive and consistent long-term investment performance and to retain and attract new Assets Under Management. 
•Performance. Our funds have continued to deliver strong investment performance compared to relevant benchmarks and compound capital for our clients. 
•Resilience. We have strengthened the balance sheet providing the firm with stability to weather potential downturns and opportunistically invest in our business to drive future returns for shareholders. We have increased our longer-duration AUM, creating longevity in our asset base and more stable earnings. 
•Alignment of interests. Sculptor Capital’s structure is designed to motivate and align the interests of our executive managing directors and employees with those of investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Our 25 active executive managing directors and 60 managing directors (as of December 31, 2022) have a compensation structure that focuses on both individual and firm-wide performance. This structure includes granting a portion of bonus compensation in a combination of equity and deferred cash interests that vest over time. 
•One-firm philosophy. Our “one-firm” philosophy promotes a collaborative environment that encourages internal cooperation and cross-functional sharing of information, expertise and transaction experience gained over our 28-year history. We believe this strong collaborative approach is a key differentiator that enhances the success of our firm as a whole and brings to bear our diverse resources and perspectives. 
•Synergies among investment strategies. Our investment model is built off of and benefits from full collaboration among our investment team, fostering trust, diverse viewpoints, cross-disciplinary development and critical self-examination. Sculptor’s investment team leadership comprises a group of 17 investment partners who have worked together for an average of over 15 years. We believe this approach and the tenure of our investment partners is a central factor in our ability to identify, evaluate and pursue opportunities across a broad range of geographies and capital structures. 
•Global presence. We are a global organization with an investment philosophy that opportunistically pursues “best ideas” investment opportunities wherever they arise.

Our Structure
Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. 
Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. is a publicly traded holding company, and its primary assets are ownership interests in the Sculptor Operating Group entities, which are held indirectly through Sculptor Corp. We conduct our business through the Sculptor Operating Group. Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. currently has two classes of shares outstanding: Class A Shares and Class B Shares.
Class A Shares.    Class A Shares represent Class A common stock in Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. The holders of Class A Shares are entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and, as of December 31, 2022, represent 37.9% of our total combined voting power. The holders of Class A Shares are entitled to any distribution declared by our Board of Directors, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of distributions and to any restrictions on the payment of distributions imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred shares we may issue in the future. Additional Class A Shares are issuable upon the exercise of warrants, as well as exchange of Partner Equity Units, subject to certain vesting and other conditions as discussed below, and upon vesting of equity awards granted under 
our Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, 2013 Incentive Plan or 2022 Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2022, we have warrants outstanding to issue an additional 4,338,015 of Class A Shares. See Note 8 for additional details on warrants.
We have also issued RSAs to certain active executive managing directors. RSAs are restricted Class A shares that are not transferable, and are subject to forfeiture, until vesting conditions are met. The RSAs entitle the holders of record to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and, as of December 31, 2022, the RSAs represent 8.3% of our total combined voting power. The RSAs are held solely by executive managing directors and have no economic rights until they vest upon satisfying a service condition and, where applicable, certain market performance conditions based on achievement of targeted total shareholder return on Class A Shares. Unvested RSAs without market performance vesting conditions accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional RSAs, and RSAs with market performance vesting conditions that have not yet met the service condition do not begin to accrue dividend equivalents until the market performance conditions have been achieved. 
Class B Shares.    Class B Shares have no economic rights and are not publicly traded, but rather entitle the holders of record to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and, as of December 31, 2022, the Class B Shares represent 53.7% of our total combined voting power. The Class B Shares are held solely by current and former executive managing directors and provide them with a voting interest in Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. commensurate with their economic interest in the Sculptor Operating Group in the form of Group A Units, Group A-1 Units (until a corresponding number of Group E Units (other than Group E-2 Units) have vested), Group E Units (once such Group E Units have vested) and Group P Units (assuming such Group P Units are participating). Each executive managing director holding Group A Units, Group A-1 Units (until a corresponding number of Group E Units (other than Group E-2 Units) have vested), vested Group E Units or Group P Units holds an equal number of Class B Shares. Upon an issuance of Group A Units or Group P Units to an executive managing director or the vesting of such executive managing director’s Group E Units, an equal number of Class B Shares is also issued to such executive managing director. Upon the exchange by an executive managing director of a Partner Equity Unit for a Class A Share as further discussed below, the corresponding Class B Share is canceled. Class B Shares that relate to our Group A-1 Units will be voted pro rata in accordance with the vote of the Class A Shares until a corresponding Group E Unit has vested.
Sculptor Operating Group Entities
We conduct our business through the Sculptor Operating Group. Historically, we have used more than one Sculptor Operating Group entity to segregate our operations for business, financial, tax and other reasons. We may increase or decrease the number of our Sculptor Operating Group entities and intermediate holding companies based on our views as to the appropriate balance between administrative convenience and business, financial, tax and other considerations.
The Sculptor Operating Group currently consists of Sculptor Capital LP, Sculptor Capital Advisors LP and Sculptor Capital Advisors II LP, and each of their consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Sculptor Operating Partnerships” and collectively with their consolidated subsidiaries, the “Sculptor Operating Group”). Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. holds its interests in the Sculptor Operating Group indirectly through Sculptor Capital Holding Corporation (“Sculptor Corp”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sculptor Capital Management, Inc. Sculptor Corp is the sole general partner of each of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships and, therefore, generally controls the business and affairs of such entities. The Sculptor Operating Group currently has the following units outstanding: Group A Units, Group A-1 Units, Group B Units, Group E Units and Group P Units.
The Group A Units and Group B Units have no preference or priority over other securities of the Sculptor Operating Group (other than the Group E Units and Group P Units to the extent described below) and, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will be entitled to any assets remaining after payment of all debts and liabilities of the Sculptor Operating Group. 
Group A Units. Our current and former executive managing directors own 100% of the Group A Units, which as of December 31, 2022, represent a 29.0% equity interest in the Sculptor Operating Group. Currently, Group A Units are exchangeable for our Class A Shares at the discretion of the Exchange Committee (which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Sculptor Capital Management, Inc.) (or the cash equivalent thereof), on a one-for-one basis, subject to vesting requirements by our executive managing directors, book-up requirements, transfer restrictions and certain exchange rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. In connection with the Recapitalization, the Sculptor Operating Partnerships initiated a distribution holiday (the “Distribution Holiday”). Holders of Group A Units do not receive 
distributions on such units during the Distribution Holiday. Each of our executive managing directors may exchange his or her vested and booked-up Group A Units over a period of two years in three equal installments commencing upon the final day of the Distribution Holiday and on each of the first and second anniversary thereof (or, for units that become vested and booked-up Group A Units after the final day of the Distribution Holiday, from the later of the date on which they would have been exchangeable in accordance with the foregoing and the date on which they become vested and booked-up Group A Units) (and thereafter such units will remain exchangeable), in each case, subject to certain restrictions (including, among other things, in connection with our insider trading policy in respect of affiliate holders and in certain circumstances where the exchange would be likely to impact our ability to use net operating losses). On the date of the Recapitalization, each Group A Unit then outstanding was recapitalized into 0.65 Group A Units and 0.35 Group A-1 Units. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
Group A-1 Units. Group A-1 Units are interests into which 0.35 of each Group A Unit then outstanding was recapitalized in connection with the Recapitalization. The Group A-1 Units will be canceled at such time and to the extent that the Group E Units granted in connection with the Recapitalization and associated with such Group A-1 Units vest and achieve a book-up. Group A-1 Units are not eligible to receive distributions at any time. However, the holders of Group A-1 Units shall participate in any sale, change of control or other liquidity event. In the Recapitalization, the holders of the 2016 Preferred Units forfeited 749,813 Group A Units, which were also recapitalized into Group A-1 Units.
Group B Units. Sculptor Corp holds a general partner interest and Group B Units in each Sculptor Operating Partnership that it controls. Group B Units are issued in respect to Class A Shares and Sculptor Corp owns 100% of the Group B Units, which, as of December 31, 2022, represent a 45.8% equity interest in the Sculptor Operating Group. Except during the Distribution Holiday, the Group B Units are economically identical to the Group A Units and represent common equity interests in our business, but are not exchangeable for Class A Shares and are not subject to vesting, forfeiture or minimum retained ownership requirements.
Group E Units. Group E Units are limited partner profits interests issued to certain executive managing directors that are only entitled to future profits and gains. Each Group E Unit converts into a Group A Unit and becomes exchangeable for one Class A Share (or the cash equivalent thereof) to the extent there has been a sufficient amount of appreciation for a Group E Unit to achieve a book-up target and, subject to other conditions contained in the limited partnership agreements of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships, the Distribution Holiday has ended (or an earlier exchange date is established by the Exchange Committee). The Group E Units are entitled to share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and become eligible to participate in any tag along right, in a change of control transaction or other liquidity event only to the extent of their relative positive capital accounts (if any). One Class B Share will be issued to each holder of Group E Units upon the vesting of each such holder’s Group E Unit, at which time, with respect to all Group E Units (other than Group E-2 Units), a corresponding number of Class B Shares held by holders of Group A-1 Units will be canceled. The general partner of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships may conditionally issue additional Group E Units to active executive managing directors, in an aggregate number not to exceed the amount described in the Sculptor Operating Partnerships’ limited partnership agreements. The Group E Units convert into Group A Units to the extent they become economically equivalent to Group A Units. As part of the Recapitalization, holders of Group E Units will not receive distributions during the Distribution Holiday. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
Group P Units. On March 1, 2017, we issued Group P Units to certain executive managing directors. In December 2021, we issued additional Group P Units to certain executive managing directors and many Group P Units that were previously held by executive managing directors were forfeited. Group P Units entitle holders to receive distributions of future profits of the Sculptor Operating Group, and each Group P Unit becomes exchangeable for one Class A Share (or the cash equivalent thereof), in each case upon satisfaction of certain service and market performance conditions at such time and, with respect to exchanges, to the extent there has been sufficient appreciation for a Group P Unit to achieve a book-up target and, subject to other conditions contained in the limited partnership agreements of the Sculptor Operating Partnerships, the Distribution Holiday has ended (or an earlier exchange date is established by the Exchange Committee). The Group P Units are entitled to share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and become eligible to participate in any tag along right, in a change of control transaction or other liquidity event only to the extent that certain market performance conditions are met and to the extent of their relative positive capital accounts (if any). 
The terms of the Group P Units may be varied for certain executive managing directors. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the terms of the Group P Units.
Restricted Share Units
We grant RSUs as a form of compensation to our employees and executive managing directors. An RSU entitles the holder to receive a Class A Share, or cash equal to the fair value of a Class A Share at the election of the Board of Directors, upon completion of the requisite service period. We may grant, from time to time, RSUs that entitle the holder to receive cash equal to fair value of a Class A Share upon completion of the requisite service period. All of the RSUs granted to date accrue dividend equivalents equal to the dividend amounts paid on our Class A Shares. To date, these dividend equivalents have been awarded in the form of additional RSUs that also accrue additional dividend equivalents. Delivery of dividend equivalents on outstanding RSUs is contingent upon the vesting of the underlying RSUs. As part of the Recapitalization, certain RSUs held by directors and certain executive managing directors are limited in the amount of dividend equivalents they may receive during the Distribution Holiday. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. 
In 2018, we began granting PSUs. A PSU entitles the holder to receive a Class A Share, or cash equal to the fair value of a Class A Share at the election of the Board of Directors, upon completion of the requisite service period, as well as satisfying certain performance conditions based on achievement of targeted total shareholder return on Class A Shares. PSUs do not accrue dividend equivalents. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding RSUs and PSUs.
The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2022:
This diagram does not give effect to 4,338,015 Class A Shares that would be issued if all of our outstanding warrants were exercised. In addition, this diagram does not give effect to 3,893,011 RSUs that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which were granted to our executive managing directors, managing directors, other employees and the independent members of our Board of Directors. Also not presented in the diagram above are 5,348,572 Group P Units and 912,500 PSUs. The Group P Units and PSUs are not participating in the economics of Sculptor Operating Group, as the applicable Market Conditions (as defined in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements) have not yet been met as of December 31, 2022. However, certain PSUs vested in the second quarter of 2021 at which time they were converted into Class A Shares. Further, not presented in the diagram above are Class C Non-Equity Interests, which are non-equity interests in the Sculptor Operating Group entities held by our executive managing directors in which they receive distributions in regards to annual discretionary cash bonus. No holder of Class C Non-Equity Interests will have any right to receive distributions on such interests. Our executive managing directors hold all of the Class C Non-Equity Interests, which may be used for discretionary income allocations, including the cash element of any discretionary annual performance awards paid to our executive managing directors. References to bonuses throughout this annual report include any Class C Non-Equity Interests distributions.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, our worldwide headcount was 343, including 25 active executive managing directors and 60 managing directors, consisting of 106 investment professionals, 209 global infrastructure professionals and 28 client partner group professionals. We have built an experienced cross-functional team with a well-established presence in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Sculptor is strongly committed to cultivating and growing a culture of diversity and inclusion. We believe that a breadth of backgrounds, experiences and knowledge is a competitive advantage and enhances the well-being and effectiveness of our employees. Sculptor’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives aim to recruit, retain, and promote diverse talent, as well as to engage and train employees with these goals in mind. We encourage employees to participate in and support one another through our affinity networks. Our current networks include affinity groups for Women, LGBTQ, Black & African American, Asian, and Hispanic & Latino employees. These groups assist in fostering diverse recruiting and retention efforts.
Recruiting and developing diverse talent is an ongoing focus for Sculptor. Sculptor targets a diverse candidate population through its recruiting efforts and partnerships with relevant organizations. Sculptor’s developmental efforts include day-to-day mentoring, training and firm-wide events. We also seek to promote diverse talent, including into senior leadership roles, wherever appropriate, which supports retention of diverse employees.
Sculptor’s annual employee performance review process is essential to establishing an equitable environment and to retaining our employees. The process ensures that employees receive detailed feedback on their performance on a formal basis at least once a year. Because compliance and ethics are a fundamental component of our firm’s culture, compliance with these key principles is part of our performance review process. Our review process also includes an evaluation of employees’ participation in promoting an inclusive firm culture. In connection with our goal to retain diverse talent and ensure an equitable environment, we regularly conduct pay equity reviews across all levels and groups within the firm.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that equitable compensation and incentive programs are critical to hiring and retaining highly qualified people. We seek to provide a pay and benefits package that is competitive within the local marketplace for our industry to reward and retain our employees and attract new talent.
Our annual discretionary performance-based cash bonus program is a significant component of our compensation program and rewards employees based in part on firm performance which directly aligns our employees with our financial performance and strategic goals. To further align the interests of our employees and to cultivate a strong sense of ownership and commitment to our firm, certain employees are also eligible to receive awards of restricted stock units or participate in our other long-term incentive programs.
Additionally, we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package which includes, among other benefits, support and coverage for physical and mental wellness. These offerings are consistent with our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
As part of our investment approach, we view ESG integration as a key component of our underwriting and risk monitoring across all investment disciplines. We believe our approach to ESG integration contributes to acting in the best interests of our clients. We are a signatory, and seek to align our ESG investment practices with the tenets set out by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“UN PRI”). We recognize that industry guidelines and best practices for ESG management will continue to evolve over time. As such, we regularly review our publicly-available ESG policy and expect to adapt accordingly. 
Our ESG policy covers all of our investment strategies and assets. This approach is rooted in our belief that ESG considerations can have important implications in investment decision-making. We see ESG integration as a complementary step in information processing that can improve investment outcomes: whereas traditional investment due diligence is focused on identifying and analyzing mostly financial and economic information, the additional step of proactively considering a broad range of non-financial risks and their materiality may enhance investment returns and optimize risk management.
Our investment professionals have primary responsibility for identifying ESG risks and opportunities as part of investment idea origination, and material issues are escalated for consideration by the relevant strategy head or investment committee, as appropriate. Similarly, all of our engagement activities are the responsibility of investment professionals and are not delegated to dedicated stewardship specialists. Strategy heads and the Partner Management Committee maintain ongoing oversight and monitoring of salient ESG matters across the portfolio through formal quarterly reporting, and informally as material ad-hoc considerations are escalated by investment professionals. 
Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations and regulatory investigations, by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Since 1999, we have been registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. We are also a company subject to the registration and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, and therefore subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. As a company with a class of securities listed on the NYSE, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE. In addition, among other rules and regulations, we are subject to regulation by the Department of Labor under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which we refer to as “ERISA.” As a registered commodity pool operator and a registered commodity trading advisor, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which we refer to as the “CFTC.” We are also subject to regulation and oversight by the National Futures Association in the U.S., as well as other regulatory bodies. 
Our European and Asian operations, and our investment activities around the globe, are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong. Currently, governmental authorities in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate have proposed additional disclosure requirements and regulation of hedge funds and other alternative asset managers.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Extensive regulation of our business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. Our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected by regulatory issues,” “—Increased regulatory focus in the U.S. could result in additional burdens on our business,” and “—Regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the U.S. could adversely affect our business”.
Global Compliance Program
We have implemented a global compliance program to address the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our company-wide operations. We have structured our global compliance program to address the requirements of each of our 
regulators, as described above, as well as the requirements necessary to support our global securities, futures, swaps, commodities and loan trading operations.
Our compliance program includes comprehensive policies and procedures that have been designed and implemented to monitor compliance with these requirements. All employees are required to complete certain annual trainings to ensure that they have the information and skills necessary to perform their duties in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and Sculptor’s requirements for the workplace. Mandatory annual compliance trainings are designed to reinforce our policies and procedures related to matters such as the handling of material non-public information, conflicts of interest and employee securities trading. Annual training specifically targeted at ensuring the understanding of and compliance with the FCPA and, as applicable, other foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations is mandatory for employees and executives responsible for structuring, supervising, ensuring compliance of and executing accounting functions for private deals, as well as for employees who interact with or provide reporting to investors. Annual trainings also cover areas relating to information security, as well as harassment prevention. In addition to a robust internal compliance framework, we have strong relationships with a global network of local attorneys specializing in compliance matters to help us quickly identify regulatory changes and address compliance issues as they arise.
