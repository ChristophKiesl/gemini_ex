Item 1. Business.
Randolph Bancorp, Inc.
 Randolph Bancorp, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Randolph Bancorp,” or the “Company”) is a Massachusetts corporation organized in 2016 and is the stock holding company of Envision Bank (“Bank”). Randolph Bancorp’s primary business activities are the ownership of the outstanding capital stock of Envision Bank and management of the investment of offering proceeds retained from Randolph Bancorp’s mutual-to-stock conversion (the “conversion”) and our initial public offering in 2016. On July 1, 2016, we completed an initial public offering in which we sold 5,686,750 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share for approximately $56.9 million in gross proceeds, including 469,498 shares sold to the Bank’s employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”). In connection with the conversion and initial public offering, we also issued 181,976 shares of common stock and contributed $455,000 in cash to Envision Bank Foundation, Inc. We also completed the acquisition of First Eastern Bankshares Corporation on July 1, 2016 for cash of $14.1 million. In the future, we may pursue other business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations for bank holding companies, which may include the issuance of additional shares of common stock to raise capital or to support mergers or acquisitions and borrowing funds for reinvestment in Envision Bank. There are no specific plans for any additional capital issuance, merger or acquisition, or other diversification of our activities at the present time. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include the Company and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis.
 At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $721.1 million, deposits of $528.3 million and stockholders’ equity of $99.8 million.
 Our cash flows depend upon repayments on the loan made to the ESOP, repurchases of stock and any dividends received from Envision Bank. We do not own or lease any property, but instead use the premises, equipment, and other property of Envision Bank. 
 Envision Bank 
 Envision Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank headquartered in Stoughton, Massachusetts with its main office in Randolph, Massachusetts. Envision Bank was organized in 1851 as Randolph Savings Bank. It reorganized into the mutual holding company structure in 2002 and into a stock holding company structure in 2016 in connection with the conversion. Envision Bank is currently the wholly-owned subsidiary of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. On July 1, 2016, we acquired First Eastern Bankshares Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Federal Savings Bank of Boston (together, “First Eastern”), which was merged with the Bank. First Eastern was actively engaged in mortgage banking including the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and the servicing of sold loans for investors. 
 Envision Bank provides financial services to individuals, families, and small to mid-size businesses through our five full-service banking offices located in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, our seven loan production offices and lending centers located throughout Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, and our digital channels via our mobile application and website. The Bank’s business consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, brokered deposits and borrowings, in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial and industrial loans, construction loans, consumer loans, and investment securities. The Bank offers a full range of deposit accounts, including statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial and regular checking accounts, and IRAs. The Bank’s digital banking services through our mobile banking site and the internet provide the ability for customers to use a variety of mobile devices to check balances, track account activity, pay bills, search transactions, deposit checks, and set up alerts for text or e-mail messages for changes in their account. The Bank is also actively involved in the sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and to other financial institutions.
 Market Area 
 Our primary deposit-taking market is Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Our primary lending market is more broadly based in Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester counties in Massachusetts; Kent, Newport, Providence, and Washington counties in Rhode Island; and Hillsborough county in New Hampshire.

Due to its proximity to Boston, our market area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning, medical care and research centers, and the corporate headquarters of several investment and financial services companies. The greater Boston metropolitan area also has many life science and high technology companies employing personnel with specialized skills. These factors affect the demand for residential homes, residential construction, office buildings, shopping centers, and other commercial properties in our market area. Communities within our market area include many residential commuter towns, which function partially as business and service centers. Although our current operations are not focused in Boston, we are affected by economic conditions in Boston because our loan portfolio includes a number of loans that are secured by real estate or that have borrowers located in Boston. In addition, a number of our customers who reside in our market area are employed in Boston, and a number of our non-owner occupied residential loan customers have properties in Boston as well as elsewhere in our market area. 
 Population and household data indicate that the market within a 20 minute drive time from any of our current branch locations is a mix of urban and suburban markets with a large commuter population. Norfolk County is the wealthiest county on the mainland of Massachusetts and is characterized by a high concentration of white-collar professionals who work in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
 Competition 
 We face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the banking institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies, such as securities brokerage firms, credit unions, and insurance companies. We also face competition for depositors’ funds from out of market banks and credit unions through their internet offerings, money market funds and mutual funds. At June 30, 2020, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), we held 1.65% of the deposits in Norfolk County, which was the 16th largest market share out of 42 financial institutions with offices in Norfolk County. Many of the banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks that operate in our primary market area are larger than we are and, therefore, may have greater resources or offer a broader range of products and services. 
 Our competition for loans comes from financial institutions, including credit unions, in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, and specialty finance companies. Competition in mortgage banking comes from traditional mortgage competitors within our market area as well as larger, nationally active mortgage originators. 
 
Lending Activities
 Our primary lending activities are the origination of real estate secured loans including one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and construction loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans, predominantly in our core market areas in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, southern New Hampshire and via the Bank’s digital banking services through our mobile application and the internet. We sell in the secondary market the majority of the fixed rate conforming one-to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate. We also sell a portion of the non-conforming one-to four-family residential mortgage loans we originate, primarily jumbo and adjustable-rate mortgage loans (“ARMs”), to other financial institutions.

Loan Maturities. The following table sets forth the scheduled contractual amortization of the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Loans having no schedule of repayments or no stated maturity are reported as being due in greater than five years except for demand loans which are reflected as due in one year or less. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which significantly shortens the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below. The amounts shown below exclude net deferred loan costs and fees, and purchase premiums. The following table also sets forth the rate structure of loans scheduled to mature after one year.

Residential Mortgage Loans. We offer mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase homes or refinance loans on existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. Excluding loans maturing in one year or less, residential mortgage loans were $235.6 million, or 48.1% of total loans, and consisted of $158.9 million and $76.7 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Non-owner occupied residential loans were $44.4 million, or 9.1% of total loans.
 We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. Generally, our fixed-rate loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (together, “GSEs”) underwriting guidelines and are originated with the intention to sell. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to ten years. Interest rates and payments on our current origination of adjustable-rate loans are adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above the one year Constant Maturity Treasury rate. Historically, we have also used the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a “reference rate” for adjustable-rate loans but have ceased doing so as LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks which will stop doing so after 2021. At December 31, 2020, 68% of residential adjustable-rate mortgages re-price based on LIBOR. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2.0% per 
 3


adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate caps range from 5.0% to 6.0% over the initial interest rate of the loan. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of LIBOR, but is not able to predict whether alternative rates the Federal Reserve proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates, and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.
 While residential mortgage loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. Additionally, our current practice is generally to: (1) sell to the secondary market newly originated 15-year or longer term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans on a servicing retained basis; (2) sell to other financial institutions newly originated conforming and non-conforming fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans on a servicing released basis; and (3) hold in our portfolio a portion of non-conforming loans, including fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. We generally do not originate “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “option ARM” loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan. Additionally, we do not offer “subprime” loans (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, or bankruptcies or to borrowers with questionable repayment capacity) or “Alt-A” loans (loans to borrowers having less than full documentation).
 We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 100.0% for some government insured loans; however, we generally require private mortgage insurance for residential loans secured by a first mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio over 80.0%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. Exceptions to this lending policy are based on the requirements of the secondary market program under which the loan is originated. We require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone.
 In an effort to provide financing for first-time home buyers, we offer adjustable- and fixed-rate loans to qualified individuals and originate the loans using programs with more flexible underwriting guidelines, loan conditions, and reduced closing costs.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2020, commercial real estate loans were $143.9 million, or 29.4% of total loans.
 We originate fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans for terms generally up to ten years, though on an exception basis commercial real estate loans will be granted with terms up to twenty years. Excluding loans maturing in one year or less, commercial real estate loans consisted of $84.1 million of fixed-rate loans and $59.1 million of adjustable rate loans at December 31, 2020. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five or seven years and generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”) classic borrowing rate and, to a lesser extent, LIBOR. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over a 25-30 year term. Loan amounts do not generally exceed 75.0% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated but may be made up to 80.0% of appraised value on an exception basis.
 We have historically focused our commercial real estate origination efforts on small- and mid-size owner occupants and investors in our market area seeking loans between $500,000 and $5.0 million. Beginning in 2019, we focused our efforts on larger relationships seeking loans between $2.0 million and $7.5 million. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes, such as industrial, flex, office buildings, warehouses, retail facilities and apartment buildings. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions.
 At December 31, 2020, the average loan balance of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $757,000 and our largest commercial real estate loan was $6.3 million in outstanding balance, with a total commitment of $9.7 million.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family real estate, generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often 
 4


depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, where applicable, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, end of loan analysis, the borrower’s expertise, credit history, profitability, global cash flow of the borrower, guarantor, and all related entities, and the value of the underlying property. We require an environmental risk assessment prior to funding for commercial real estate loans.
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, which are secured by one-to four-family residences. At December 31, 2020, home equity loans and lines of credit were $48.2 million, or 9.8% of total loans. Home equity lines of credit have monthly adjustable rates of interest with 15-year draw periods which are then amortized over 10 years. These loans are indexed to the prime rate and generally are subject to an interest rate floor. Our home equity loans generally have a fixed interest rate. We offer home equity loan and lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80.0%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loan and first mortgage loan. Any home equity loan or line of credit made with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80.0% is made as a policy exception.
 The procedures for underwriting home equity loans and lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. The procedures for underwriting residential mortgage loans apply equally to home equity loans and lines of credit.
 Construction Loans. At December 31, 2020, construction loans were $31.1 million, or 6.3% of total loans. We originate construction loans only in our market area of Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We primarily originate construction loans to contractors and builders, and to individuals, to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make construction loans for commercial development projects, including small industrial buildings as well as apartment, retail and office buildings. Our construction loans generally are floating-rate, interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may be paid in full or converted to a permanent mortgage loan. Construction loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75.0% of appraised market value for commercial construction and 80.0% of appraised market value for owner-occupied residential construction loans estimated upon completion of the project. Before making a commitment to fund a residential construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Our construction loans generally do not provide for interest payments to be funded by interest reserves. At December 31, 2020, our largest construction loan outstanding was $5.0 million.
 Our commercial loan policy requires a minimum equity contribution by the borrower of 10% to 30% depending on the loan type. All borrowers are underwritten and evaluated for creditworthiness based on past experience, debt service ability, net worth analysis including available liquidity, and other credit factors. We generally require personal guarantees on all construction loans. Advances are only made following an inspection of the property confirming completion of the required progress on the project and an update to the title completed by a bank approved attorney. For owner-occupied residential construction loans, loan to value ratios of greater than 80.0% may be approved when credit enhancements or mortgage insurance is in place.
 Construction financing is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of the foregoing, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. We make commercial and industrial loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses. At December 31, 2020, commercial and industrial loans were $20.3 million, or 4.1% of total loans. As discussed in more  detail below, this amount included $10.9 million of PPP (as defined below) loans. Commercial lending products include term and time loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit are generally made with variable rates of interest. Variable rates are based on either the 30 Day LIBOR rate or the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Fixed-rate business loans are generally indexed to a corresponding FHLBB Classic rate, plus a margin. Commercial and industrial loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small- to medium-sized, privately held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area. In addition, 
 5


commercial and industrial loans (excluding loan participations) are generally made only to existing customers having a business or individual deposit account and new borrowers are expected to establish appropriate deposit relationships with us if not already a depositor.
 When making commercial and industrial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, and the value of the collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment. Generally, loans are supported by personal guarantees. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial and industrial loans (excluding loan participations) are generally made in amounts of up to 50.0% to 80.0% of the value of the collateral securing the loan.
 At December 31, 2020, our largest commercial and industrial loan (excluding loan participations) was a $4,500,000 loan and our largest commercial line of credit was $1,000,000, of which $834,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2020. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, substantial disruptions to the global economy and to the customers and communities that we serve. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation has been enacted, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the establishment of participating in the Small Business Administration’s (the “SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). The CARES Act appropriated $349 billion for “paycheck protection loans” through the PPP. The amount appropriated for the PPP was subsequently increased to $659 billion. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances and are 100% guaranteed by SBA. PPP loans have an initial term of up to five years and earn interest at a rate of 1% with payments deferred for the first 10 months following the covered period, which is eight to twenty-four weeks following the date the loan is made. Additionally, on December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the “Economic Aid Act”) was enacted which, among other items provided an additional $284 billion for an additional round of PPP loans, which also introduced new borrower eligibility for the program. The Company is participating in this additional round of PPP.
 During 2020, the Company funded 197 PPP loans totaling $15.4 million, for which it received $649,000 in origination fees from the SBA. These fees are being amortized over the expected life of the loans, which is two years for loans originated prior to June 4, 2020 and five years for loans originated June 5, 2020 or later, but which is accelerated and recognized as interest income upon forgiveness of the loan. The Company had $10.9 million of PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020. Through December 31, 2020, 44 of our PPP loans totaling $4.4 million had been forgiven by the SBA, resulting in $427,000 in origination fees recognized in interest income. We currently expect that a significant portion of our remaining PPP loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program.
 Commercial and industrial loans also involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.
 Consumer Loans. We originate automobile loans, loans secured by passbook or certificate accounts, unsecured personal loans and overdraft loans. We also purchase consumer loans. We expanded our purchases of consumer loans in 2017 to include refinanced student loans and automobile loans. No student loans have been purchased since 2017 and we deliberately diminished our purchases of consumer loans from third parties in 2020. We purchased approximately $1.0 million and $5.4 million of automobile loans in 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, total purchased consumer loans totaled $9.5 million, while the entire consumer loan portfolio totaled $10.3 million, or 2.1% of total loans. 
 The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. Bank management assesses the underwriting criteria for each of the entities from which it purchases consumer loans as part of its pre-purchase due diligence process. Refinanced student loans, which totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2020, were purchased from an on-line lender specializing in the origination and refinancing of such loans. Applicants are screened based on a comprehensive set of underwriting criteria designed to assess “ability to pay”, including minimum FICO scores, monthly free cash flow, maximum leverage ratios and delinquency history. On average, borrowers on refinanced student loans have demonstrated six to seven years of payment history on their existing student loan prior to refinancing. Purchased automobile loans, which totaled $5.5 million at December 31, 2020, are purchased from a local lender specializing in the origination of such loans primarily to undocumented immigrants. In addition to the vehicle collateral, these loans include a credit enhancement from the originator. The Bank also purchased in prior years

unsecured personal loans from a national on-line lender which have an average FICO score at loan origination of 730. At December 31, 2020, such loans totaled $469,000 and had an average balance of $8,700. 
 Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, death or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.
 Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales. The primary source of loan originations are our in-house loan originators, advertising, and referrals from customers. We also purchase commercial real estate loans or participation interests in commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans.
 Our current practice is generally to: (1) sell to the secondary market newly originated 15-year or longer term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans; (2) sell to other financial institutions newly originated non-conforming fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans; and (3) hold in our portfolio a portion of non-conforming loans, including fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. Our decision to sell loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management. Loans are sold to third parties with servicing either retained or released. In addition, we sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent to manage our credit risk.

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also originate one-to four- family residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary mortgage market or to other financial institutions. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Bank originated $1.6 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.4 billion of such loans, respectively of which 77%, 53% and 25%, respectively, were refinanced loans.
 Loan Participations. We look to form relationships with other financial institutions and mitigate risk of our lending activities by participating either as the lead bank or as a participant in various loan transactions. We independently underwrite each loan using underwriting practices that generally do not differ from loans that we originate.
 At December 31, 2020, the outstanding balances of loan participations purchased totaled $20.5 million and loan participations sold totaled $2.4 million. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balances of loan participations purchased totaled $20.5 million and loan participations sold totaled $5.3 million.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. The senior lending officer is authorized to grant lending authority to officers and other employees in individual amounts up to $1,500,000. The president and chief executive officer is authorized to grant lending authority to officers and other employees in individual amounts up to $3,000,000. Delegation of such authority is made after due consideration of the individual’s lending experience, past performance and his or her area of responsibility. Our board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain executive officers. Loans in excess of $3.0 million must be approved by the credit committee, which is comprised of seven members of our management team. Loans in excess of $5.0 million must also be approved by the board of directors. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower Limit. The maximum amount that the Bank may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20.0% of its capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the Bank’s capital stock, surplus account, and undivided profits. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $18.0 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship totaled $9.7 million and was secured by commercial real estate properties. 
 Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 60 days.
Mortgage Banking Activities
 We originate residential mortgage loans for our portfolio, for sale into the secondary market and for sale to other financial institutions. We generally underwrite our residential mortgage loans to conform to GSE standards. Approximately 94% of the residential real estate loans that we originated in 2020 were sold or designated for sale into the secondary market. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of loan commitment. We may subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment and sell some or all of our ARMs or fixed-rate mortgages as part of our asset/liability management function. Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. The unpaid principal balances of mortgage loans serviced for others were $1.76 billion and $1.05 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net gains or losses recognized upon the sale of loans are included in noninterest income. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank sold $1.50 billion and $0.89 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans and recognized a net gain on loan origination and sale activities of $54.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively.
 Loans sold into the secondary market and to financial institutions are sold on either a servicing retained, or servicing released basis. We retained the servicing on 83% of loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. At the end of 2020, we started a plan to outsource our residential loan servicing activities, which is expected to improve our customer service experience and our operational and financial efficiency in the year ahead.
 We also consider the sale of the rights to service blocks of loans from time to time when we do not otherwise have a relationship with the customer. The decision to sell the right to service loans also takes into consideration regulatory capital rules under Basel III which require that a haircut to capital be taken when mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) exceed 25% (10% in 2019 and prior) of Tier 1 Capital. In 2020 and 2019, no MSRs were sold. 
 Interest rates affect the amount and timing of origination and servicing fees because consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity are sensitive to changes in mortgage interest rates. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees but may also lead to a decrease in mortgage servicing income, a component of noninterest income, depending on the level of new loans added to the servicing portfolio and the level of prepayments. The amount and timing of the impact on origination and servicing fees will depend on the magnitude, speed, and duration of the change in interest rates.

MSRs are recognized as separate assets at fair value when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. We capitalize MSRs at their fair value upon sale of the related loans. Capitalized servicing rights are amortized into mortgage servicing income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. MSRs are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. We measure impairment of our MSRs on a disaggregate basis based on the predominant risk characteristics of the portfolio, and we discount the asset’s estimated future cash flows using a current market rate. We have determined the predominant risk characteristics to be prepayment risk and interest-rate risk. To determine the fair value of MSRs, we estimate the expected future net servicing revenue based on common industry assumptions, as well as on our historical experience.
 The following table sets forth activity for our MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
 
 
(In thousands) | 2020 | | | 2019 | 
-------------------------------+------+--------+---+------+--
Balance, beginning of year | $ | 8,556 | | | $ | 7,786 | 
Additions through originations | | 8,432 | | | | 2,979 | 
Amortization | | (2,544 | ) | | | (1,281 | )
Valuation allowance | | (2,067 | ) | | | (928 | )
Balance, end of year | $ | 12,377 | | | $ | 8,556 | 
Fair value, end of year | $ | 12,490 | | | $ | 8,817 | 

 
Changes in interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of MSRs, including prepayment speeds, expected returns and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, the value of escrow balances and other servicing valuation elements. A decline in interest rates generally increases the propensity for refinancing, reduces the expected duration of the servicing portfolio and therefore reduces the estimated fair value of MSRs. This reduction in fair value can cause a charge to mortgage servicing income. Conversely, an increase in interest rates generally increases the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights. Due to the decline in interest rates experienced during 2020 and 2019, we increased the valuation allowance for MSRs by $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Mortgage servicing income (loss), net of amortization and changes in the valuation allowance, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $(1.2 million) and $0.4 million, respectively.
 Asset Quality
 Nonperforming Assets. We consider foreclosed assets, loans that are maintained on a nonaccrual basis and loans that are past 90 days or more and still accruing to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they are classified as impaired or when they become 90 days or more past due. Loans are classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest ceases and unpaid interest income previously accrued on such loans is reversed against current period interest income. Payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance when collectability of principal is in doubt.
 Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at fair market value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Any holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income.
 Troubled debt restructurings occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower’s financial difficulties. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates) or to provide for temporary interest-only terms, or to forgive or defer the payment of interest. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. We generally do not forgive principal on loans. Once the borrower has demonstrated sustained performance with the modified terms, the loan may be upgraded from its classified and/or nonperforming status. Any loan categorized as troubled debt restructurings will continue to retain that designation through the life of the loan.

 Interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $194,000. Income related to nonaccrual loans included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $105,000.
 Classified Loans. Federal regulations require us to review and classify assets on a regular basis. In addition, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When management classifies an asset as substandard or doubtful a specific allowance for loan losses may be established. If management classifies an asset as loss, an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets that do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification, but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. We utilize an eight-grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, construction, and commercial and industrial loans. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Special mention loans totaling $1.4 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were on nonaccrual.
 The $5.5 million increase in loans classified as special mention in 2020 included a commercial real estate loan secured by hotels totaling $4.6 million; a commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel of $1.5 million; and other loans totaling $3.3 million. In addition, downgrades of special mention loans to substandard loans during the year included a commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel of $2.9 million. There were approximately $900,000 in payoffs of special mention loans during the year ended 2020. 
 Included in the above table are $9.4 million in special mention loans which have been granted short-term loan payment deferrals for customers experiencing a hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The $9.4 million in special mention loans relate to commercial real estate loans in the hospitality industry and directly impacted industries where full repayment of the loan was in question beyond the initial deferral period. There were also $4.2 million in substandard loans which have been granted short-term loan payment deferrals for customers experiencing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, there were $37.4 million in pass rated loans which have been granted short-term loan payment deferrals for customers experiencing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Other than as disclosed in the above tables, there are no other loans where management has information indicating that there is serious doubt about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.
 Delinquencies. The following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated. Loans which have been granted pandemic-related short-term loan payment deferrals totaling $51.0 million at December 31, 2020 are considered current based on compliance with the modified repayment terms.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a regular basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
 Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of: (1) an allocated component related to impaired loans and (2) a general component related to the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
 Allocated Component. The allocated component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired. Residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction and commercial and industrial loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. Impairment is measured by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An allowance is 
 12


established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer loans or second mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are 90 days or more past due or subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement.
 General Component. The general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by our loan segments. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a trailing 48-month period, a time frame appropriate to capture relevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and adversely classified or graded loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans; changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; changes in the quality of the institution’s review system; the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution’s existing portfolio; changes in the value of underlying collateral-dependent loans; and the existence of concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
 We periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring, unless deemed insignificant. All troubled debt restructurings are initially classified as impaired.
 We identify loans that may need to be charged-off as a loss by reviewing all impaired loans and related loss analyses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectability of the loan balance is confirmed. A borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan and a shortfall in collateral value would generally result in our charging off the loan to the extent of the loss deemed to be confirmed.
 At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was $6.8 million, or 1.38% of total loans, or 1.41% of total loans, excluding PPP loans of $10.9 million and 94.6% of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was $4.3 million, or 0.90% of total loans and 131.4% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 were $7.2 million, or 1.46% of total loans, compared to $3.3 million, or 0.69% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. However, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover losses which may be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.

Investment Activities
 General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. We classify all of our securities as available-for-sale. We do not engage in securities trading activities.
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLBB, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLBB stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2020.

(1) | Yields for municipal investments are presented on a tax equivalent basis.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 U.S. Government - Sponsored Enterprises. At December 31, 2020, we had U.S. government and agency securities totaling $2.0 million, which constituted 3.7% of our securities portfolio. While these securities may provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection.
 Corporate Debt Securities. At December 31, 2020, we had corporate debt securities totaling $4.3 million, which constituted 8.0% of our securities portfolio. All of our corporate debt securities are investment grade and have remaining maturities of less than ten years. These securities generally provide slightly higher yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities.
 Municipal Securities. At December 31, 2020, we had municipal securities totaling $595,000, which constituted 1.1% of our securities portfolio. All of our current municipal securities have remaining maturities of less than 10 years. These securities generally provide higher yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid than other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio.
 16


Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2020, we had residential mortgage-backed securities totaling $32.5 million, which constituted 60.6% of our securities portfolio, and commercial mortgage-backed securities totaling $9.8 million, which constituted 18.3% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” pro-rata based on each investor’s respective interest in the security, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees.  Residential mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. Commercial mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors, such as Envision Bank.  The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises totaling $1.0 million, which constituted 1.9% of our securities portfolio, and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by a U.S. government agency totaling $3.4 million, which constituted 6.3% of our securities portfolio. 
 Collateralized mortgage obligations are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages similar to mortgage-backed securities.  These two types of securities differ in how the principal and interest is received by their respective investors.  Cash flows from collateralized mortgage obligation securities typically are not received in the same pro-rata fashion as mortgage-backed securities.  Collateralized mortgage obligations can have contractually defined “tranches” that specify differing maturity dates, interest rates and principal balances.
 Other Securities. We held common stock of the FHLBB in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2020. The FHLBB common stock is carried at cost. 
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us non-interest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2020, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $8.6 million and was issued by six insurance companies, all of which were rated A- or better by A.M. Best Company.
Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.
 Deposit Accounts. Deposits are attracted from within our market area by sales efforts of our retail, business development and commercial lending officers, advertising (including direct mail), and through our website. We offer a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. We also utilize brokered deposits to help fund loan growth.
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to offer periodically special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term.
 17


Business Banking. We also offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for businesses. Our business banking deposit products include a commercial checking account and checking accounts specifically designed for small businesses. We also offer remote deposit capture products for business customers to meet their online banking needs. Additionally, we offer money market accounts for businesses. We are seeking to increase our commercial deposits through expansion of our commercial loan portfolio and the resulting increase in our base of commercial customers.
 Deposits. The following table sets forth the average balances and weighted average rates of our deposit products at the dates indicated.

Borrowings. We may utilize advances from the FHLBB to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLBB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLBB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our residential and commercial real estate loans. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the FHLBB’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $61.9 million and $44.4 million, respectively, in outstanding advances from the FHLBB. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLBB stock, and based upon our internal policy, we had access to additional FHLBB advances of up to $93.9 million and $136.5 million, respectively. We also have a $4.2 million available line of credit with FHLBB and a $7.5 million available line of credit with a correspondent bank at December 31, 2020. We had no borrowings outstanding under either of these lines of credit at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Advances from the FHLBB are secured by a blanket pledge agreement on the Bank’s qualified collateral, defined principally as 75% of the carrying value of pledged first mortgage loans on owner-occupied residential property and 65% on pledged commercial real estate loans.
 The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our short-term FHLBB borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated.

In conjunction with the PPP, the Federal Reserve Board has created the Paycheck Protection Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) to facilitate lending by eligible financial institutions to small businesses under the PPP. Pursuant to the PPPLF, the applicable Federal Reserve Bank extends credit to depository institutions on a non-recourse basis with a term of up to five years at an interest rate of 0.35%. Only loans issued under the PPP can be pledged as collateral to access the facility. The Company utilized $15.4 million in advances from the PPPLF to fund its PPP loans, $11.4 million of which remained outstanding at December 31, 2020. The FDIC allows the Company to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on Tier 1 leverage capital ratios.
 Personnel and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 208 total employees, including 203 full-time and 5 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have a good standing relationship with our employees.
 We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs.
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to transition, over a short period of time, 80% of our employees to effectively working from remote locations and ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at branches and operations centers. All employees are asked not to come to work when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and have been provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, reimbursing certain child care costs, keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs.

Supervision and Regulation 
 General
 Envision Bank is a Massachusetts stock savings bank and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Randolph Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, which is a registered bank holding company. Envision Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and by the Depositors Insurance Fund, a private industry-sponsored insurance fund, for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Envision Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency and state regulator, and by the FDIC, as its federal regulator and deposit insurer. Envision Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition. Envision Bank must also obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. Envision Bank must comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). Envision Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLBB.
 As a bank holding company, Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the federal securities laws.
 The federal and state regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of other creditors or shareholders. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets, and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the CFPB, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. and Envision Bank.
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Randolph Bancorp, Inc. and Envision Bank. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Randolph Bancorp, Inc. and Envision Bank.
 Pandemic Response
 The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual, unprecedented and evolving public health and economic crisis that may have a significant adverse impact on the economy, the banking industry and the Company in future fiscal periods, all of which are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act appropriated $349 billion for “paycheck protection loans” through the PPP. The amount appropriated was subsequently increased to $659 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had originated 197 PPP loans totaling approximately $15.4 million. Additionally, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act was enacted on December 27, 2020, providing for a second round of PPP loans (“PPP-2”). The Bank is participating in both the PPP and PPP-2. PPP loans that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government, have an initial term of up to five years, and earn interest at rate of 1%. We currently expect a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, there was $649,000 million in origination fee income that will be recognized over the life of the loan. The average authorized loan size is $78,000 and the aggregate number of jobs positively impacted is approximately 1,733. In conjunction with the PPP, the Federal Reserve has created a lending facility for qualified financial institutions. The PPPLF will extend credit to depository institutions with a term equal to the term of the pledged collateral at an interest rate of 0.35%. Only loans issued under the PPP can be pledged as collateral to access the facility.

Troubled Debt Restructuring Relief. From March 1, 2020 through the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020 concerning the COVID–19 outbreak, a financial institution may elect to suspend the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for loan modifications related to the COVID–19 pandemic that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, including impairment accounting. This TDR relief is applicable for the term of the loan modification that occurs during the applicable period for a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. Financial institutions are required to maintain records of the volume of loans involved in modifications to which TDR relief is applicable.
Holding Company Regulation
 General. Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”). As such, Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve and subject to regulations, examinations, supervision, and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over Randolph Bancorp, Inc. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Randolph Bancorp, Inc.’s subsidiary insured depository institution.
 Permissible Activities. A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5.0% of any class of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities that the Federal Reserve had determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto as of November 11, 1999. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve had determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment, or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. A bank holding company that is well capitalized and well managed within the meaning of applicable regulations and whose subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed and meet certain additional requirements, may elect to become a “financial holding company.” Such an election allows a bank holding company to engage in a broader array of financial activities, including insurance and investment banking activities.
 Acquisition of Control. The BHCA provides that no company may directly or indirectly acquire control of a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Any company that acquires control of a bank becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Pursuant to federal regulations, the term “company” is defined to include banks, corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities, and a company has “control” of a bank or other company if the company owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 25.0% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company, or if the Federal Reserve determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to merging with another bank holding company or acquiring securities of a bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 5.0% of any class of voting stock of the bank or bank holding company.
 In evaluating applications by bank holding companies to acquire depository institutions, the Federal Reserve must consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institutions involved, the convenience and needs of the community, effectiveness of the institutions involved in the transaction in combating money laundering activities, the extent to which a proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system, and competitive factors. The Federal Reserve may not approve a transaction that would result in a monopoly and may not approve a transaction that would substantially lessen competition in any banking market unless it finds that the anticompetitive effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed.
 Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, no person, directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other persons, may acquire control of an insured depository institution or a depository institution holding company unless the appropriate federal banking agency has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve is the appropriate federal banking agency with respect to an acquisition of control of a bank holding company. Acquisitions subject to approval under the BHCA are exempt from the prior notice requirement. “Control,” as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act and as implemented by the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding companies, means the power to directly or indirectly direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or to vote 25.0% or more of any class of voting 
 21


securities of the bank holding company. Acquisition of more than 10.0% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock is subject to a rebuttable presumption of control by the Federal Reserve if the bank holding company has registered securities under section 12 of the Exchange Act or if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the acquisition. There are also rebuttable presumptions in the regulations concerning whether a group is “acting in concert,” including presumed concerted action among members of an “immediate family.” Accordingly, the filing of a notice with the Federal Reserve would be required before any person or group of persons acting in concert could acquire 10.0% or more of the common stock of Randolph Bancorp, Inc., unless the person or group of persons files a rebuttal of control that is accepted by the Federal Reserve.
 The Federal Reserve may prohibit a proposed acquisition of control if it finds, among other things, that:
  
• | the acquisition would result in a monopoly or substantially lessen competition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the financial stability of the institution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the competence, experience or integrity of the acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors or the public to permit the acquisition of control by such person; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the acquisition would have an adverse effect on the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital. Upon reaching $3 billion in total consolidated assets, Randolph Bancorp, Inc. would become subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies (on a consolidated basis). Subject to certain exceptions, including an exception for bank holding companies with less than $1 billion of assets, regulations enacted by the Federal Reserve subject bank holding companies to regulatory capital requirements that are the same as or more stringent than the capital requirements applicable to Envision Bank. These capital requirements include provisions that, when applicable, might limit the ability of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase its shares. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Requirements.” Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is not subject to these capital requirements as its total consolidated assets are below $3 billion, and we believe it otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Reserve’s small bank holding company policy statement, including certain qualitative requirements with respect to nonbanking activities, off-balance sheet activities, and publicly-registered debt and equity. The small bank holding company policy statement generally facilitates the transfer of ownership of small community banks by allowing their holding companies to operate with higher levels of debt than would otherwise be permitted.
 Source of Strength. Under federal law, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is expected to commit resources to support Envision Bank, including at times when Randolph Bancorp, Inc. may not be in a financial position to provide such resources.
 Dividends and Repurchases. A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10.0% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The policy statement also states that a bank holding company should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, or otherwise engage in capital distributions. In addition, the ability of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends may be restricted if Envision Bank becomes undercapitalized.
 22


Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the BHCA. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5.0% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register and file reports with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. There is an exemption from the requirement to obtain Board of Bank Incorporation approval for certain transactions involving a merger or consolidation subject to approval by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.
 Federal Banking Regulation
 Business Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including savings banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered savings banks which had previously done so may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law. Such grandfathered authority may be terminated under certain circumstances, including a change in charter or a determination by the FDIC that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk.
 The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and the FDIC has determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.
 Capital Requirements. The FDIC currently requires federally insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System, or state non-member banks, to meet minimum capital standards: a 4.5% Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio, a 6.0% Tier 1 equity to risk weighted assets ratio, an 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio and a leverage ratio of 4.0%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule that ended in 2019, the FDIC’s capital rules require Envision Bank to establish a capital conservation buffer of Tier I common equity in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.50% of total risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2020, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. If Randolph Bancorp, Inc. becomes subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy rules for bank holding companies, then Randolph Bancorp, Inc. would also become subject to a similar capital conservation buffer requirement that could restrict its ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. On- and off-balance exposures are assigned to various risk-weight categories based primarily on relative risk.
 Under the FDIC’s rules, an FDIC supervised institution, such as Envision Bank is considered “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of at least 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Envision Bank is currently considered “well capitalized” under this standard.
 Dividends. A state non-member bank may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required by the FDIC’s regulatory capital regulations or for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. In addition, Envision Bank’s ability to pay dividends may be limited if Envision Bank does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may limit the ability of Randolph Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends to its shareholders. See “—Capital Requirements.”
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state non-
 23


member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The CRA requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Envision Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent federal examination.
 Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA that is applicable to Envision Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but uses a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office, or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Envision Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.”
 In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 Transactions with Related Parties. An insured depository institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulations. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with an insured depository institution, such as Envision Bank; however, a subsidiary of a bank that engages in bank permissible activities is generally not treated as an affiliate. Randolph Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of Envision Bank because of its control of Envision Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. Transactions with affiliates also must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, generally not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the insured depository institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
 Envision Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and 10.0% or greater shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Under federal law, an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to such insiders:
  
• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Envision Bank’s capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Envision Bank’s loan committee or board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 Additionally, federal law requires asset sale transactions with insiders to be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10.0% of the capital and surplus of Envision Bank, it must be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of Envision Bank.
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement responsibility over state non-member banks and has authority to bring enforcement actions against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers, and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action by the FDIC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient 
 24


capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. In addition, banks are permitted, subject to regulatory approval, to acquire other banks in any state, provided that certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions are satisfied, and to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for banks chartered by the host state.
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. The FDIC is required by law to take supervisory action against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital.
 An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
 Generally, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date that an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of an institution that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures, such as a restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 Community Bank Leverage Ratio. Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Growth Act”), which was enacted on May 24, 2018, directs the federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of tangible capital to average total consolidated assets of not less than 8.0% or more than 10.0%. In September 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Section 201 of the Growth Act, effective January 1, 2020, establishing a community bank leverage ratio framework for community banking organizations having total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, having a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0%, and satisfying other criteria, such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. A community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the banking agencies’ generally applicable capital rules and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The final rule includes a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater than 9.0% leverage ratio requirement, generally would still be deemed well-capitalized so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio greater than 8.0%. At the end of the grace period, the banking organization must meet all qualifying criteria to remain in the community bank leverage ratio framework or otherwise must comply with and report under the generally applicable rule. As required by Section 4012 the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies temporarily lowered the community bank leverage ratio, issuing two interim final rules to set the community bank leverage ratio at 8.0% and then gradually re-establish it at 9.0%. Under the interim final rules, the community bank leverage ratio was set at 8.0% beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Community banks that have a leverage ratio of 8.0% or greater and meet certain 
 25


other criteria may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework. Beginning in 2021, the community bank leverage ratio will increase to 8.5% for the calendar year. Community banks will have until January 1, 2022, before the leverage ratio requirement to use the CBLR framework will return to 9.0%. At this time, the Company does not anticipate opting in to the CBLR.
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as Envision Bank. Deposit accounts in Envision Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to take steps as may be necessary to cause the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits - the designated reserve ratio - to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and it mandates that the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC for any year may not be less than 1.35%. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
 To satisfy these requirements, on March 15, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The final rule imposes on large banks a surcharge of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. Large banks will pay quarterly surcharges in addition to their regular risk-based assessments. Overall regular risk-based assessment rates will decline once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. Small banks, such as Envision Bank, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment. The revised deposit insurance assessment pricing became effective on July 1, 2016.
 On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36%. Because the reserve ratio has exceeded 1.35% small banks, such as Envision Bank, received credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC notified eligible institutions of their credit amount in January 2019. The credits were first applied on the September 2019 assessment invoice (for the second quarter of 2019), when the reserve ratio first reached or exceeded 1.38%. Credits are applied so long as the reserve ratio is at or above 1.35%. After applying the credits for four quarters, the FDIC remits to such banks the value of any remaining credits on the next assessment invoice, so long as the reserve ratio remains at least 1.35%. The credit amount applied cannot exceed the institution’s quarterly assessment amount due.
 Deposit insurance premiums are based on assets. To determine its deposit insurance premium, Envision Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. On April 26, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. The rule utilizes the CAMELS rating system, which is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. Under the final rule each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures that are similar to the factors that the FDIC previously considered in assigning institutions to risk categories, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets, and considerations related to asset quality. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small banks with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 range from 3 to 30 basis points.
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Envision Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew, or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the 
 26


FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10.0% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. Section 202 of the Growth Act amends Section 29 of the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. Specifically, the Growth Act provides that reciprocal deposits received by an agent depository institution that places deposits (other than those obtained by or through a deposit broker) with a deposit placement network are not considered to be funds obtained by or through a deposit broker to the extent the total amount of such reciprocal deposits does not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of the depository institution’s total liabilities. However, a depository institution that is less than well capitalized may not accept or roll over such excluded reciprocal deposits at a rate of interest that is significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its market area or a national rate cap established by the FDIC.
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. State non-member banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). Envision Bank’s required reserves can be in the form of vault cash and, if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (the “FRB”). The Federal Reserve regulations currently require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts except for transaction accounts up to $15.5 million, which are exempt. Transaction accounts greater than $15.5 million up to $115.1 million have a reserve requirement of 3.0%, and those greater than $115.1 million have a reserve requirement of approximately $2.99 million plus 10.0% of the amount over $115.1 million. The Federal Reserve generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered reserves. Envision Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Envision Bank is a member of the FHLBB, which is one of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, Envision Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2020, Envision Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Envision Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank stock. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment has been recognized.
Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision
 General. As a Massachusetts stock savings bank, Envision Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, and payment of dividends. In addition, Envision Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock, and undertake certain other activities. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies, and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound, or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that a bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances.
 Lending Activities. A Massachusetts savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans, and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security.
 Insurance Sales. A Massachusetts savings bank may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Envision Bank does not currently sell or refer insurance products.
 27


Dividends. A Massachusetts savings bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Non-cash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited, or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes.
 Parity Authority. A Massachusetts bank may, after providing 30 days’ prior notice to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal savings associations or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity.
 Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank’s capital stock, surplus, and undivided profits.
 Loans to a Bank’s Insiders. Massachusetts banking law prohibits any executive officer or director of a bank from borrowing or guaranteeing extensions of credit by such bank except to the extent permitted by federal law.
 Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank’s deposits. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Envision Bank’s investment activities. See “—Federal Banking Regulation—Business Activities.”
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies, and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint a liquidating agent under certain conditions, such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, or impaired capital. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Envision Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
 Depositors Insurance Fund. The Depositors Insurance Fund is a private, industry-sponsored insurance fund which insures bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institution’s risk category, similar to the method currently used to determine assessments by the FDIC discussed above under “—Federal Banking Regulation—Insurance of Deposit Accounts.”
 Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements are similar to those of federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices.
 Massachusetts has additional statutes and regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.
