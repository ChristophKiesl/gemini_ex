We are a leading lease-to-own provider with operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

Through our Rent-A-Center Business, we provide a fully integrated customer experience through our e-commerce platform and brick and mortar presence. Our Preferred Lease business offers lease-to-own solutions through retail partners in stores and online enabling our partners to grow sales by expanding their customer base utilizing our differentiated offering. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986, and our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “RCII.”

The Lease Purchase Transaction
The lease purchase transaction is a flexible alternative that provides freedom for consumers who wish to obtain use and enjoyment of brand name merchandise with no long-term obligation and without having to pay the full price up front. Generally, our customer has the right, but is not obligated, to acquire title to the merchandise either through an early purchase option or through payment of all lease renewals that would be required to obtain ownership. 
The unit economics of the lease purchase transaction vary depending on the length of time customers take to obtain ownership of the product. In same-as-cash option transactions, a customer pays the full price of the merchandise within a designated period of time following the initial lease and generally pays the retail price of the product plus a premium to the cost. Full term lease-to-own transactions involve the customer leasing our merchandise through a lease structured with multiple lease renewal terms and ultimately obtaining ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of the final lease renewal term. Due to the longer term of these transactions along with the other benefits that are part of the lease-to-own transaction, full term transactions involve a higher total cost compared to the cost of the general retail price of the product if it was purchased upfront. Customers primarily take ownership of the merchandise through same-as-cash options or early purchase options, where the customer pays off outstanding amounts prior to the final lease renewal at a discount. In the Rent-A-Center Business, the product is often rented more than one time before a customer ultimately obtains ownership. 
There are differences in the unit economics between our Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease segments, as we purchase our merchandise at wholesale prices for our Rent-A-Center Business segment and at retail prices for our Preferred Lease segment. Historically, operating margin for our Preferred Lease segment has benefited from the lower overhead cost associated with the virtual options employed at many third party locations. 
Key features of the lease purchase transaction include:
No long term obligation. A customer may terminate a lease purchase agreement at any time without penalty. Once the product is returned to us, the customer has no obligation for remaining payments other than any outstanding balances to the date of return.
Convenient payment options. Our customers make payments on a weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis in our stores, at our retail partner locations, online or by telephone. We accept cash, credit or debit cards and payment via certain electronic platforms (such as PayPal and Venmo). Rental payments received at our store or retail partner locations are generally made in advance. Rental payments together with applicable fees, constitute our primary revenue source. Approximately 77% and 93% of our rental purchase agreements are on weekly terms in our Rent-A-Center Business and our Mexico segments, respectively. Payments are generally made on a biweekly or monthly basis in our Preferred Lease segment. 
Flexible options to obtain ownership. Ownership of the merchandise generally transfers to the customer if the customer continuously renews the lease purchase agreement for a required period of between seven and 30 months, depending upon the product type, or exercises a specified early purchase option.
Reinstatement. If a customer is temporarily unable to make payments on a piece of rental merchandise and returns the merchandise, that customer generally may later re-rent the same piece of merchandise (or, if unavailable, a substitute of comparable quality, age and condition) on the terms that existed at the time the merchandise was returned, and pick up payments where they left off without losing credit for what they previously paid.
No formal credit needed. Generally, no established credit score or credit history is required. In the Rent-A-Center Business segment, we typically verify a customer’s residence and sources of income, and may utilize other sources to verify certain information contained in the lease purchase order form. In our Preferred Lease segment, which provides an on-site lease-to-own option at a third-party retailer's location, customers complete the application process through a variety of resources, including online digital waterfall technology, retail partner electronic portals and online e-commerce websites, and a robust proprietary automated decision engine process is used to confirm certain customer information for approval of the lease purchase agreement.
Brand name merchandise. In our store locations and through our retail partnerships, we offer merchandise from a large number of well-known brands such as Ashley home furnishings; LG, Samsung, and Sony home electronics; Frigidaire, Whirlpool, Amana, and Maytag appliances; HP, Dell, Acer, Apple, Asus, Samsung and Toshiba computers and/or tablets; and Samsung and Apple smartphones.
Delivery and set-up included. We generally offer same-day or next-day delivery and installation of our merchandise at no additional cost to the customer in our lease-to-own stores. Our Preferred Lease locations rely on our third-party retail partners to deliver merchandise rented by the customer. Our third-party retail partners typically charge us a fee for delivery, which we pass on to the customer. 
Product maintenance and replacement. We provide any required service or repair without additional charge, except in the event of damage in excess of normal wear and tear and certain other limited circumstances. The cost to repair the merchandise may be reimbursed by the vendor if the item is still under factory warranty. If the product cannot be repaired at the customer’s residence, we provide a temporary replacement while the product is being repaired. If the product cannot be repaired, we will replace it with a product of comparable quality, age and condition.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is focused on growing our business model through emphasis on the following key initiatives:
•executing on market opportunities and enhancing our competitive position across both traditional and virtual lease-to-own solutions;
•accelerating the shift to e-commerce, expanding product categories, including into emerging product categories, and improving the fully integrated customer experience;
•using technology to support frictionless partner onboarding with seamless integration to retail partner platforms;
•continuing to generate repeat business while expanding our potential customer base;
•leveraging the integration of the Acima decision engine and expanding digital payments and communication channels; and
•generating favorable adjusted EBITDA margin and strong free cash flow to fund strategic priorities and deliver and return capital to shareholders.
As we pursue our strategy, we may take advantage of merger and acquisition opportunities from time to time that advance our key initiatives, and engage in discussions regarding these opportunities, which could include mergers, consolidations or acquisitions or dispositions or other transactions, although there can be no assurance that any such activities will be consummated.
For additional information regarding the acquisition of Acima in the Merger, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Recent Developments”.
Our Operating Segments
We report financial operating performance under four operating segments. To better reflect the Company's current strategic focus, our retail partner business operations are reported as the Preferred Lease segment (formerly Acceptance Now), which includes our virtual, staffed and hybrid business models; and our company-owned stores and e-commerce platform through 
rentacenter.com are reported as the Rent-A-Center Business segment (formerly Core U.S.). In addition, we report operating results for our Mexico and Franchising segments. Additional information regarding our operating segments is presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and financial information regarding these segments and revenues by geographic area are provided in Note T to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Substantially all of our revenues for the past three years originated in the United States.
Rent-A-Center Business
Rent-A-Center Business is our largest operating segment and includes our company-owned stores in the United States and Puerto Rico and our e-commerce platform rentacenter.com. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 1,845 company-owned stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, including 44 retail installment sales stores under the names “Get It Now” and “Home Choice.” We routinely evaluate the locations in which we operate to optimize our store network. Our Rent-A-Center Business segment comprised approximately 66% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 80% of our business in this segment is from repeat customers. 
Preferred Lease
Our Preferred Lease segment operates in the United States and Puerto Rico and provides an on-site lease-to-own option at a third-party retailer’s location, including staffed options, unstaffed or virtual options or a combination of the two (the hybrid model). Our Preferred Lease operating segment includes Preferred Dynamix, a proprietary digital platform that leverages new decisioning technology and a portfolio of new lease-to-own solutions to expand the ways that consumers and retailers interact. In the event a retail purchase credit application is declined, the customer can be introduced to an in-store Preferred Lease representative at our staffed locations, or work with a representative of the third party retailer or directly with our virtual solution to initiate the lease-to-own transaction to obtain the merchandise. Because we neither require nor perform a formal credit investigation for the approval of the lease purchase transaction, we use a proprietary automated process to confirm certain customer information for approval of the lease purchase agreement. We believe our Preferred Lease model is beneficial for both the retailer and the consumer. The retailer captures more sales because we buy the merchandise directly from them. We believe consumers also benefit from our Preferred Lease model because they are able to obtain the products they want and need without the necessity of credit. We generally pay the retail price for merchandise purchased from our retail partners and subsequently leased to the customer. Through certain retail partners, we offer our customers the option to obtain ownership of the product at or slightly above the full retail price if they pay within 90 days. In some cases, the retailer provides us a rebate on the cost of the merchandise if the customer exercises this 90-day option. 
Our Preferred Lease operating model is highly agile and dynamic because we can open and close locations quickly and efficiently. Generally, our Preferred Lease staffed locations consist of an area with a computer, desk and chairs. We occupy the space without charge by agreement with each retailer. In our virtual locations, transactions are initiated through an electronic portal accessible by retail partners on their store computers, on our retail partners' e-commerce sites or through our mobile application. Accordingly, capital expenditures with respect to new Preferred Lease locations are minimal. 
We rely on our third-party retail partners to deliver merchandise rented by the customer. Such third-party retail partners typically charge us a fee for delivery, which we pass on to the customer. In the event the customer returns rented merchandise, we pick it up at no additional charge. Merchandise returned from a Preferred Lease location is subsequently offered for rental at one of our Rent-A-Center Business stores.
We intend to combine Acima's virtual capabilities with our Preferred Lease platform to provide retailers and consumers an expanded set of innovative solutions to enter into lease-to-own transactions. Our virtual offering will allow consumers to enjoy the benefits of the Company’s flexible lease-to-own solutions across e-commerce, digital, and mobile channels. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the Preferred Lease Segment will include the results of Acima and will be renamed the Acima Segment.
Mexico
Our Mexico segment consists of our company-owned lease-to-own stores in Mexico. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 121 stores in Mexico. 
Franchising
The stores in our Franchising segment use our Rent-A-Center, ColorTyme or RimTyme trade names, service marks, trademarks and logos, and operate under distinctive operating procedures and standards. Franchising's sources of revenue include the sale of merchandise to its franchisees who, in turn, offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a lease-to-own transaction, and royalties collected from franchisees based on a percentage of revenue. 
As of December 31, 2020, we franchised 462 stores in 33 states operating under the Rent-A-Center (398 stores), ColorTyme (29 stores) and RimTyme (35 stores) names. These lease-to-own stores primarily offer high quality products such as furniture and accessories, consumer electronics, appliances, computers, wheels and tires.
As franchisor, Franchising receives royalties of 2.0% to 6.0% of the franchisees’ monthly gross revenue and, generally, an initial fee up to $10,000 per new location.
The following table summarizes our locations allocated among these operating segments as of December 31 of each of the years indicated below:

 | 2020 | 2019 | | 2018
Rent-A-Center Business | 1,845 | | 1,973 | | 2,158
Mexico | 121 | | 123 | | 122 
Franchising | 462 | | 372 | | 281 
Total locations(1) | 2,428 | | 2,468 | | 2,561

(1) Does not include locations in our Preferred Lease segment.
The following discussion applies generally to all of our operating segments, unless otherwise noted.
Rent-A-Center Operations
Store Expenses
Our expenses primarily relate to merchandise costs and the cost of operating our stores, including salaries and benefits for our employees, occupancy expense for our leased real estate, advertising expenses, lost, damaged, or stolen merchandise, fixed asset depreciation, and other expenses.
Product Selection
The stores in our Rent-A-Center Business, Mexico, and Franchising segments generally offer merchandise from certain basic product categories: furniture and accessories, appliances, consumer electronics, computers, tablets and smartphones. In addition, in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, we have recently expanded into other product categories including tools, tires, handbags and other accessories. Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores to offer customers a wide variety of models, styles and brands, we generally limit merchandise to prescribed levels to maintain strict inventory controls. We seek to provide a wide variety of high quality merchandise to our customers, and we emphasize products from name-brand manufacturers. Customers may request either new merchandise or previously leased merchandise. Previously leased merchandise is generally offered at a similar weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease rate as is offered for new merchandise, but with an opportunity to obtain ownership of the merchandise after fewer lease payments.
Our furniture products include dining room, living room and bedroom furniture featuring a number of styles, materials and colors. Accessories include lamps and tables and are typically rented as part of a package of items, such as a complete room of furniture. Showroom displays enable customers to visualize how the product will look in their homes and provide a showcase for accessories. Appliances include refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dryers, and ranges. Consumer electronic products offered by our stores include high definition televisions, home theater systems, video game consoles and stereos. We offer desktop, laptop, tablet computers and smartphones. 
The merchandise assortment may vary in our non-U.S. stores according to market characteristics and consumer demand unique to the particular country in which we are operating. For example, in Mexico, the appliances we offer are sourced locally, providing our customers in Mexico the look and feel to which they are accustomed in that product category.
Preferred Lease locations offer the merchandise available for sale at the applicable third-party retailer, primarily furniture and accessories, consumer electronics and appliances.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, furniture and accessories accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated rentals and fees revenue, appliances for 16%, consumer electronic products for 14%, computers for 5%, smartphones for 3% and other products and services for 17%.
Product Turnover
On average, in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, a rental term of 16 months or exercising an early purchase option is generally required to obtain ownership of new merchandise. Product turnover is the number of times a product is rented to a different customer. On average, a product is rented (turned over) to multiple customers before a customer acquires ownership. Merchandise returned in the Preferred Lease segment is moved to a Rent-A-Center Business store where it is offered for rent. Ownership is attained in approximately 41% of rental purchase agreements in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. The average total life for each product in our Rent-A-Center Business segment is approximately 15 months, which includes the initial rental period, all re-rental periods and idle time in our system. To cover the higher operating expenses generated by the key benefits of rental purchase transactions and product turnover, rental purchase agreements require higher aggregate payments than are generally charged under other types of purchase plans, such as installment purchase or credit plans.
Collections
Store managers use our management information system to track collections on a daily basis. If a customer fails to make a rental payment when due, store personnel will attempt to contact the customer to obtain payment and reinstate the agreement, or will terminate the account and arrange to regain possession of the merchandise. We attempt to recover the rental items as soon as possible following termination or default of a rental purchase agreement. Collection efforts are enhanced by the personal and job-related references required of customers, the personal nature of the relationships between our employees and customers, and the availability of lifetime reinstatement. Currently, we track past due amounts using a guideline of seven days in our Rent-A-Center Business segment and 30 days in the Preferred Lease segment. These metrics align with the majority of the rental purchase agreements in each segment, since payments are generally made weekly in the Rent-A-Center Business segment and monthly in the Preferred Lease segment.
If a customer does not return the merchandise or make payment, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on or before the 90th day following the time the account became past due in the Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, and during the month following the 150th day in the Preferred Lease segment.
Purchasing
In our Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, we purchase our rental merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In 2020, approximately 20% of our merchandise purchases were attributable to Ashley Furniture Industries. No other brand accounted for more than 10% of merchandise purchased during these periods. We do not generally enter into written contracts with our suppliers that obligate us to meet certain minimum purchasing levels. Although we expect to continue relationships with our existing suppliers, we believe there are numerous sources of products available, and we do not believe the success of our operations is dependent on any one or more of our present suppliers.
In our Preferred Lease segment, we purchase the merchandise selected by the customer from the applicable third-party retailer at the time such customer enters into a lease purchase agreement with us.
With respect to our Franchising segment, our franchise agreements with franchisees require the franchised stores to exclusively offer for rent or sale only those brands, types and models of products that Franchising has approved. The franchised stores are required to maintain an adequate mix of inventory that consists of approved products for rent as dictated by Franchising policy manuals. Franchisees can purchase product through us or directly from various approved suppliers.
Management
Our executive management team has extensive lease-to-own or similar retail experience and has demonstrated the ability to grow and manage our business through their operational leadership and strategic vision. Our regional and district managers generally have long tenures with us, and we have a history of promoting management personnel from within. In addition, during 2020, we hired certain key management members in the Preferred Lease segment to lead our strategic efforts in our virtual and e-commerce business solutions, including our Executive Vice President of Preferred Lease, who brings extensive experience and a proven track record of innovation in financial services and financial technology.
We believe our executive management team's extensive industry and company experience will allow us to effectively execute our strategies.
Marketing
We promote our products and services through television and digital radio commercials, print advertisements, store telemarketing, digital display advertisements, direct email campaigns, social networks, paid and organic search, website and store signage. Our advertisements emphasize such features as product and name-brand selection, the opportunity to pay as you go without credit, long-term contracts or obligations, delivery and set-up at no additional cost, product repair and loaner services at no extra cost, lifetime reinstatement and multiple options to acquire ownership, including 180-day option pricing, an early purchase option or through a fixed number of payments. In addition, we promote the “RAC Worry-Free Guarantee®” to further highlight these aspects of the lease purchase transaction. We believe that by leveraging our advertising efforts to highlight the benefits of the lease purchase transaction, we will continue to educate our customers and potential customers about the lease-to-own alternative to credit as well as solidify our reputation as a leading provider of high-quality, branded merchandise and services.
Franchising has established national advertising funds for the franchised stores, whereby Franchising has the right to collect up to 4.5% of the monthly gross revenue from each franchisee as contributions to the fund. Franchising directs the advertising programs of the fund, generally consisting of television and radio commercials and print advertisements. Franchising also has the right to require franchisees to expend up to 3% of their monthly gross revenue on local advertising.
Industry & Competition
According to data released by the Fair Isaac Corporation on September 10, 2019, consumers in the “subprime” category (those with credit scores below 650) made up approximately 28% of the United States population. Two-thirds of U.S. consumers have incomes below $75,000 and may lack access to traditional credit. The lease-to-own industry provides customers the opportunity to obtain merchandise they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit.
Our stores, kiosks and other lease-to-own operations compete with other national, regional and local lease-to-own businesses, including on-line only competitors, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. With respect to customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit, we also compete with retail stores, online competitors, and non-traditional lenders. Competition is based primarily on convenience, store location, product selection and availability, customer service, and lease rates and terms. 
The growing lease-to-own industry is contributing to this already highly competitive environment for our business. The lease-to-own industry has experienced steady growth, and revenue gains have accelerated since 2015. The lease-to-own industry is introducing rapid change with the emergence of virtual and kiosk-based operations at retail partner locations, such as our Preferred Lease offering which consists of staffed kiosks at retail partner locations options, unstaffed or virtual lease-to-own options, or a combination of the two (the hybrid model). These new industry participants are disrupting traditional lease-to-own stores by attracting customers and making the lease-to-own transaction more acceptable to potential customers. In addition, banks and consumer finance companies are developing products and services designed to compete for the traditional lease-to-own customer. 
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds. 
At times during 2020, we also experienced increased merchandise sales due to government stimulus payments and unemployment benefits received by our targeted consumers as part of the government’s response to COVID-19.
Trademarks
We own various trademarks and service marks, including Rent-A-Center® and RAC Worry-Free Guarantee® that are used in connection with our operations and have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The duration of our trademarks is unlimited, subject to periodic renewal and continued use. In addition, we obtained the trademarks Acima® and Acima Credit® upon the consummation of the Merger, and have obtained other trademark registrations in Mexico, Canada and certain other foreign jurisdictions. We believe we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks and service marks essential to our business. The products held for rent in our stores also bear trademarks and service marks held by their respective manufacturers.
The Franchising segment licenses the use of the Rent-A-Center® and ColorTyme® trademarks and service marks to its franchisees under its franchise agreements with such franchisees. The Franchising segment owns various trademarks and service marks, including ColorTyme® and RimTyme®, that are used in connection with its operations and have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office. The duration of these marks is unlimited, subject to periodic renewal and continued use.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 14,320 coworkers, the vast majority of which are full time employees. Our employee base is made up of 12,250 coworkers in our U.S. Operations, including Puerto Rico, 1,240 coworkers in our Mexico operations and 830 coworkers at our corporate facilities. The consummation of the Merger on February 17, 2021, increased the number of employees by 530 coworkers.
We continually monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled coworkers. We believe our coworkers are one of the primary keys to successfully operating our business and achieving our strategic initiatives. Our human capital measures and objectives focus on the successful training and development of our coworkers, in addition to their safety. All of our coworkers are employed at will and are free to end their employment with us at any time. 
We also focus on supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce. In 2020, we created a new Chief Diversity Officer position that will regularly report to our Board of Directors. We have also implemented a program to deliver unconscious bias training to our employees and have launched and are expanding our Employee Resource Groups to promote a dialogue with our employees regarding our diversity initiatives.
During fiscal year 2020, in connection with our response measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the temporary and partial operational closures throughout the U.S. and Mexico, we temporarily furloughed certain employees at our operating locations and corporate headquarters. As of December 31, 2020, no employees are on furlough as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we make employee safety a priority and have implemented multiple measures within our operation locations, as well as our corporate headquarters, to protect the health and safety of our coworkers during the ongoing pandemic.
Government Regulation
Rent-A-Center Business and Preferred Lease
State Regulation.    Currently, 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have rental purchase statutes that recognize and regulate rental purchase transactions as separate and distinct from credit sales. We believe this existing legislation is generally favorable to us, as it defines and clarifies the various disclosures, procedures and transaction structures related to the lease-to-own business with which we must comply. With some variations in individual states, most related state legislation requires the lessor to make prescribed disclosures to customers about the rental purchase agreement and transaction, and provides time periods during which customers may reinstate agreements despite having failed to make a timely payment. Some state rental purchase laws prescribe grace periods for non-payment, prohibit or limit certain types of collection or other practices, and limit certain fees that may be charged. Eleven states limit the total rental payments that can be charged to amounts ranging from 2.0 times to 2.4 times the disclosed cash price or the retail value of the rental product. Six of those eleven states also limit the cash price of merchandise to amounts ranging from 1.56 to 2.5 times our cost for each item.
Although Minnesota has a rental purchase statute, the rental purchase transaction is also treated as a credit sale subject to consumer lending restrictions pursuant to judicial decision. Therefore, we offer our customers in Minnesota an opportunity to purchase our merchandise through an installment sale transaction in our Home Choice stores. We operate 17 Home Choice stores in Minnesota.
North Carolina has no rental purchase legislation. However, the retail installment sales statute in North Carolina expressly provides that lease transactions which provide for more than a nominal purchase price at the end of the agreed rental period are not credit sales under the statute. We operate 86 lease-to-own stores and 45 Preferred Lease staffed locations in North Carolina.
Courts in Wisconsin and New Jersey, which do not have rental purchase statutes, have rendered decisions which classify rental purchase transactions as credit sales subject to consumer lending restrictions. Accordingly, in Wisconsin, we offer our customers an opportunity to purchase our merchandise through an installment sale transaction in our Get It Now stores. In New Jersey, we have modified our typical rental purchase agreements to provide disclosures, grace periods, and pricing that we believe comply with the retail installment sales act. We operate 27 Get It Now stores in Wisconsin and 40 Rent-A-Center stores in New Jersey. 
There can be no assurance as to whether changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations or the enactment of new laws or regulations that may unfavorably impact the lease-to-own industry would have a material and adverse effect on us.
Federal Regulation.    To date, no comprehensive federal legislation has been enacted regulating or otherwise impacting the rental purchase transaction. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) does not regulate leases with terms of 90 days or less. Because the lease-to-own transaction is for a term of week to week, or at most, month to month, and established federal law deems the term of a lease to be its minimum term regardless of extensions or renewals, if any, we believe the lease-to-own transaction is not covered by the Dodd-Frank Act.
From time to time, we have supported legislation introduced in Congress that would regulate the rental purchase transaction. While both beneficial and adverse legislation may be introduced in Congress in the future, any adverse federal legislation, if enacted, could have a material and adverse effect on us.
Mexico
No comprehensive legislation regulating the lease-to-own transaction has been enacted in Mexico. We use substantially the same rental purchase transaction in Mexico as in the U.S. stores, but with such additional provisions as we believe may be necessary to comply with Mexico’s specific laws and customs.
Available Information

We also provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all members of our Board of Directors, as well as all of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer and controller. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics forms the foundation of a compliance program we established as part of our commitment to responsible business practices that includes policies, training, monitoring and other components covering a wide variety of specific areas applicable to our business activities and employee conduct. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is published on our website at https://investor.rentacenter.com/governance-documents. We intend to make all required disclosures concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our website.
