ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
The Company (formerly Live Oak Acquisition Corp. and referred to as LOAK when describing the period prior to the consummation of the Business Combination described below) was incorporated in Delaware on May 24, 2019 as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Live Oak competed its initial public offering in May 2020. On December 29, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Meredian Holdings Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Meredian Holdings Group” or “MHG”) through the exchange of MHG common stock for Live Oak Class A common stock. The Business Combination was effected through the merger of Green Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Oak, with and into MHG, with MHG surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Oak.
 
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name from Live Oak Acquisition Corp. to Danimer Scientific, Inc.
 
The following description of our business describes the business historically operated by Meredian Holdings Group and its subsidiaries under the “Danimer Scientific” name as an independent enterprise prior to the Business Combination (“Legacy Danimer”) and which will be operated by the Company after the Business Combination.
 
Overview
 
Danimer is a performance polymer company specializing in developing and producing bioplastic replacements for traditional petrochemical-based plastics. We, through our principal operating subsidiaries, Meredian, Inc., Danimer Scientific, L.L.C. and Danimer Scientific Kentucky, Inc., bring together innovative technologies to deliver renewable, environmentally friendly bioplastic materials to global consumer product companies. We have core competencies in fermentation process engineering, chemical engineering and polymer science. In addition, we have created an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our innovations that together with our technology, serves as a valuable foundation for our business and for future industry collaborations. We primarily market our products to consumer packaging brand owners, converters and manufacturers in the plastics industry seeking to address environmental, public health, renewability, certification, composting and biodegradability concerns because of customer perceptions, government regulations, or other reasons.   
 
We believe that we are the only commercial company in the bioplastics market to combine the production of a base polymer along with the reactive extrusion capacity in order to give customers a “drop-in” replacement for a wide variety of petrochemical-based plastics. Our process uses sustainably-sourced canola oil. Our proprietary extraction and extrusion processes are cost competitive and leave almost no carbon footprint. Our customized formulations enable us to team up with other makers of biobased products to create an even wider range of goods. Our scalable production capacity and modular manufacturing model will soon enable us to serve an increasingly large customer base. An industry leader as gauged by our over 16-year history, a patent portfolio of over 150 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, supply agreements with some of the largest consumer packaged goods companies and numerous awards, including PLASTICS Industry Association’s 2020 Innovation in Bioplastics award, Danimer is one of the few companies anywhere in the world to achieve this level of sustainability in biopolymer products and processes.

Our Technologies
 
PHA Technology Platform
 
Danimer is a leading producer of polyhydroxyalkanoate (“PHA”), which occurs naturally in living organisms and is chemically similar to polyesters. PHAs serve as a biodegradable alternative to petrochemical-based plastics. Since 2020, Danimer has sold PHAs commercially under our proprietary Nodax® brand name for usage in a wide variety of plastic applications including water bottles, straws, and food containers, among others. Our PHA biopolymers are formulated to meet the biodegradability requirements for ASTM International and European (EN) standards. Our PHA is also U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved for food contact and will biodegrade aerobically or anaerobically in soil, water and industrial or home compost within three to six months depending on conditions.
 
We originally acquired our PHA technology from Procter & Gamble in 2007. PHAs are made through a fermentation process in which bacteria consume vegetable oil and produce PHA within their cell membranes as energy reserves. We harvest the excess PHA from the bacteria, then purify and filter it before extruding it into pellets, which we sell. We believe PHAs are a complete replacement for petrochemical-based plastics with the added benefit that our customers are not required to purchase new equipment in order to switch to using our bio-plastics products in most cases. Utilizing PHAs as a base resin significantly expands the number of potential applications for bioplastics in the plastics industry and also enables us to produce resin that is not just compostable, but also fully biodegradable.
 
PLA Technology Platform
 
Danimer also creates proprietary plastics using the natural plastic polylactic acid (“PLA”) as a base resin and has been in this line of business since 2004. Danimer’s reactive extrusion technology has allowed many companies to begin to use renewable and compostable plastics to meet their customers’ growing sustainability needs. Danimer is a pioneer in bioplastics technology, demonstrated by early successes such as creating a bioplastic suitable for coating disposable paper cups to withstand the temperatures of hot liquids such as coffee. Danimer has expanded its product portfolio and now supplies customers globally. Danimer has two primary manufacturing platforms: reactive extrusion and polymer synthesis. In reactive extrusion, new polymers are made by combining PLA with other plant-based materials or minerals to be able to meet the needs of customers that cannot use non-formulated (“neat”) PLA. In polymer synthesis, new proprietary polymers are made in reactors (vertical tanks with ability to control pressure, heat, agitation, pH, etc.) and then pelletized. In addition to developing plastics, we also toll manufacture for customers that need the unique extruder or reactor setup employed by Danimer for new or scale-up production. Our PLA-based biopolymers are formulated to meet the biodegradability requirements for ASTM International and European (EN) standards.
The Plastics Market and Competitive Landscape
 
The plastics market is large with many established players. The market has grown around the chemical processing of oil and natural gas and is concentrated in the conventional, nonbiodegradable petroleum-based segment.
 
Established companies in this segment include The Dow Chemical Company, E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, BASF Corporation, INEOS USA LLC, LyondellBasell Industries N.V., Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, among many others. The price of conventional petroleum-based plastic is volatile, as it is dependent on petroleum as a key manufacturing input. In addition, the non-biodegradability of conventional petroleum-based plastics makes them persistent in and harmful to the environment and creates significant waste.
 
Competitive companies that produce bioplastics include Kaneka Corporation (produces 3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate “PHBH”) and Novamont S.p.A. (makes polybutylene adipate terephthalate (“PBAT”)).
 
Danimer PHA biopolymers offer a broad range of properties and processing options and can address a large portion of the opportunities for environmentally attractive yet functionally equivalent alternatives to conventional petroleum-based plastics. Unlike PLA and most starch-based composite biodegradables, PHA biopolymers can:
 

● | biodegrade in natural soil and water environments, including the marine environment; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | remain functional through a wide range of temperatures; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | withstand everyday use without breaking down.

Market Opportunity
 
General: Globally, over 800 billion pounds of plastic are produced each year. We believe that both PHA and PLA are excellent replacements for commercial plastics created with synthetic polymers derived from petrochemicals. Danimer believes that PHA is a competitive replacement for polypropylene (“PP”), polyethylene (“PE”), polystyrene (“PS”), and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) plastics. These plastics represent over 63% of traditional petrochemical-based plastic worldwide, so there is potential for PHAs to replace over 500 billion pounds of plastic applications annually.
 
The bioplastics industry is diverse and rapidly evolving. As companies continue to innovate new bioplastic products to meet existing and future customer needs, the industry is expected to expand substantially. Bioplastics are used in a wide range of applications, including packaging, adhesives, food additives, food service items and many others. Bioplastics are a key segment of the plastics industry and offer a renewably sourced replacement for traditional petrochemical-based plastics with additional benefits such as compostability, biodegradability and enhanced safety.
 
Environmental: Opportunities arising from the plastics industry’s negative environmental impacts include a demand for an alternative of more products and packaging using sustainable, renewable, and non-petroleum resources. Additionally, we believe there is heightened demand for biodegradable and compostable materials, as well as materials that facilitate greater safety for the public and the environment. A 2018 global corporate sustainability report by Nielsen found consumers in global markets are motivated to be more environmentally conscious with their purchases. In light of this sentiment, companies are looking for ways to divert landfill waste and environmental waste with the use of bioplastics. With the “end of life” scenarios that bioplastics provide, these companies are now testing new materials to be more proactive in reducing the global pollution problem.
 
Public Health: Manufacturers of products that are used for food packaging or food services may place priority on the development of bioplastics that eliminate the potentially negative health effects of petrochemical-based plastics. While not yet conclusive, some scientific research suggests that polystyrene, PVC, polyethylene, and many other traditional plastics may be linked to certain cancers, endocrine disruptions, digestive dysfunctions, impaired immune function, and other serious health issues. We believe that this perception of traditional plastics, especially in food contact applications, is driving numerous product manufacturers toward the use of non-petrochemical-based plastics.
 
Renewability: Some manufacturers place an even greater emphasis on renewability rather than biodegradability or compostability of materials. In Europe, we believe many manufacturers place higher priority on renewability simply because of consumer perceptions and governmental regulations.
 
Certification: The certification of materials in the bioplastics industry is based upon third-party standards that establish criteria for labeling materials and products. Certifications are important to brand owners and consumers as they give assurance that materials have been rigorously tested and vetted. Once certification has been achieved for our products, we and our customers are authorized to utilize labels indicating the bioplastic meets certification guidelines, which we believe give consumers greater confidence in our products.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to build a commercially successful biopolymers business, with attractive margins, based on the unique properties of our PHA and PLA biopolymers. To achieve this goal, we are developing and commercializing biopolymers in a range of applications. We believe this will provide an attractive base of commercial opportunities for Danimer, creating value for our business and our customers and generating leading intellectual property positions in the field.

Key elements of our strategy include:
 

● | Expansion of our Kentucky Facility. In order to meet the increasing demand for PHA, in December 2018 we purchased an idled fermentation facility in Kentucky that was well-suited for the commercial production of PHA (the “Kentucky Facility”) and simultaneously entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with a large, diversified commercial property real estate investment trust (the “REIT”) with respect to the Kentucky Facility and certain of our facilities located in Bainbridge, Georgia. We have embarked on a two-phase commissioning strategy for the Kentucky Facility. When acquired, the Kentucky Facility included fermentation capacity, some downstream processing equipment and warehouse space. We completed several components of Phase I of the production capacity buildout at the Kentucky Facility in the third quarter of 2020. The Phase I production capacity expansion involved retrofitting the facility to startup the three smaller fermenters, removing existing equipment not needed for our PHA-production process, and adding downstream processing equipment necessary to process PHA from those three fermenters. Phase I also included the necessary extrusion equipment to create the final formulated bioplastic. We commenced scale-up fermentation runs in December 2019. Phase I capacity is approximately 20 million pounds of finished product per year. We plan to expand the capacity of the plant by another 45 million additional pounds of finished product, bringing total plant capacity up to 65 million pounds per year, by investing approximately $100 million for Phase II production capacity expansion. Phase II construction has commenced, and we expect to complete Phase II by the end of the second quarter of 2022. Phase II will involve retrofitting two more fermenters that already exist in the Kentucky Facility. Phase II will also include constructing three new buildings and expanding an existing building to house the additional downstream processing equipment and extrusion equipment needed to handle the increased output from the two larger fermenters. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Greenfield Facilities. We have begun exploring construction of new fermentation plants in order to further expand our production capability of PHA. In 2020, we intensified those efforts by engaging with our engineering partner to design an optimal commercial production module for future greenfield PHA plants. Additionally, after undertaking a detailed site selection process, we have selected Bainbridge, Georgia, as the site for our initial greenfield facility. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Research and Development. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are seeking to expand on the number of PHA research and development (“R&D”) contracts we have with global consumer product companies. R&D contracts provide revenue and we expect successful R&D processes to culminate in supply agreements with the customers. As customers’ products are moved from R&D to commercialization, new customer R&D contracts can be signed, which we believe will result in a pipeline of future products. As our PHA production capacity expands, through completion of Phase II capacity buildout at the Kentucky Facility and the development of additional PHA plants thereafter, we believe that we will have adequate supply needs in significant part due to the pipeline created by our R&D contracts. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strategic Partnerships. As global plastic production increases, we anticipate that we will not be able to supply all bioplastic needs in the foreseeable future. To address this, we are exploring strategic partnerships and licensing opportunities. These opportunities have the potential to greatly expand our product penetration beyond our ability to raise and deploy capital. Even with an aggressive plan to add facilities, we expect that the percent of the market we capture through new plants will still be less than 1% of the global demand for petrochemical replacements during the next decade. Considering the size of the plastics market and the unique properties of our PHA, we will continue to explore innovative ways to partner with world-leading companies to meet what we expect to be a growing demand.

Our Products and Services
 
We offer the following products and services.
 
PHA-based resins: We produce PHA in a fermentation process where bacteria consume vegetable oil and produce PHA as energy reserves. We harvest this PHA and produce numerous configurations of this polymer, yielding a diverse array of possible properties in the resulting material. PHA is a naturally occurring bioplastic that effectively biodegrades in both anaerobic environments, such as a waste treatment facility, and aerobic environments, such as industrial compost, home compost, soil, fresh water and marine water. PHA will degrade in environments in which microbes or fungi are present, without the presence of additional heat or moisture. This ease of degradation creates numerous options for companies that use plastics as part of their business because industrial composting facilities, which have limited capacity throughout the world, are not required to ensure PHA-based plastics ultimately biodegrade after use.
 
Our Nodax® PHA is 100% bio-based and possesses six TUV AUSTRIA certifications: OK compost INDUSTRIAL, OK compost Home, OK biodegradable SOIL, OK biodegradable Water, OK biodegradable MARINE, and OK biobased. All of Danimer’s biopolymers, including Nodax® PHA, and are FDA approved for food contact.
 
We are responding to unprecedented customer demand for PHA by developing an aggressive long-term plan to add facilities beyond the new fermentation plant in Kentucky in order to further monetize our technology. In 2020, we intensified those efforts by engaging with our engineering partner to design a commercial production module for future greenfield PHA plants. We will continue to improve this modular plant design as we employ the valuable lessons learned by operating our commercial facility in Kentucky and our development plant in Bainbridge.
 
PLA-based resins: PLA is made from dextrose “sugar” that is derived from corn, sugar beets and sugar cane, among others. It is “industrially compostable” as per ASTM D6400 standards, which require a plastic to aerobically compost in a municipal industrial facility within 180 days. PLA requires additional heat and moisture to begin degrading by hydrolysis, which is why it is certified for industrial composting only. While PLA is produced by other companies such as NatureWorks LLC (“NatureWorks”) and Total Corbion PLA (“Total Corbion”), PLA in non-formulated (“neat”) form has limited functionality.
 
However, when we combine PLA with other plant-based chemicals and minerals through our reactive extrusion process, we can improve PLA-based products’ processability, impact strength, heat tolerance and numerous other attributes to meet customer specifications for a wide range of applications to support petrochemical-based plastic replacement. Our ability to formulate PLA in this manner enables us to acquire customers that neat PLA producers cannot.
 
Research and development: We have a number of PHA R&D contracts with global consumer products companies, including PepsiCo, Nestlé and Genpak. We collaborate with the R&D staff of each customer on products that are tailored for each customer’s specific applications.
 
Tolling: We contract with customers to use our existing production facilities and expertise to help customers meet complex raw material opportunities. In 2015, we started making our production facilities and expertise available to tolling customers. There are many companies that toll manufacture in the U.S. for products that are large volumes at low prices. We consider “Specialty Tolling,” which usually means lower volumes at higher margins, to be one of our core competencies. In many cases, we manufacture the tolling products on the same equipment as the PLA-based resins.
 
Customers and Product Applications
 
We believe we are well-positioned to capture market share with our streamlined and flexible development process. We possess world-class research and development capabilities for new products. Since the inception and commercialization of our first products, a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from the sale of materials utilized in single-use food service articles. While we expect single-use food service articles to remain a significant component of our revenue, we continue to develop new products for many different applications; therefore, our client base is changing along with our product mix.

Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis, in particular PLA, polybutylene succinate (“PBS”), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (“PBAT”) and canola oil. Although certain of these raw materials have limited sources of supply, we have developed strategic relationships with key suppliers for these products and generally have commitments or contracts from these suppliers to meet current and projected needs. We buy PLA from NatureWorks and Total Corbion, PBS from PTT MCC Biochem Co., Ltd and PBAT from BASF Corporation. Commodities such as canola oil are readily available from numerous suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be able to procure the necessary quantity and quality of raw materials needed to manufacture our products.

Intellectual Property and Technology
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property, and we rely on a combination of patents, know-how, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and supply chain partnerships to establish and protect our intellectual property. We hold over 150 patents and pending patent applications worldwide (of which more than 80 are patents issued and more than 70 pending applications) in more than 20 countries. Our extensive patent portfolio covers, among other things, the fundamental biotechnology needed to produce our PHA biopolymers as well as biopolymer compositions, processes, derived products, and applications. The terms of such patents are set to expire at various times between 2022 and 2040, and any patents resulting from such pending patent applications are expected to have durations that will expire between 2038 and 2041. We own 23 issued patents and 1 pending application with respect to the fundamental biotechnology needed to produce our PHA biopolymers, the expiration dates (or expected expiration dates) for which range from 2022 to 2039, as well as 69 issued patents and 71 pending applications with respect to biopolymer compositions, processes, derived products and applications, the expiration dates (or expected expiration dates) for which range from 2022 to 2040. Our technology is also protected by maintaining trade secret status for key technology and know-how. In addition, non-disclosure agreements with customers and research partners help to keep our technology proprietary.
 
We purchased the intellectual property portfolio that formed the original basis of our PHA technology platform from The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”). After a global offering of the technology to competent entities, P&G determined that our expertise and demonstrated success offered the highest probability of successful commercialization. P&G has retained a royalty interest equal to $0.05 per pound of PHA sold up to 500,000,000 pounds and $0.025 per pound over 500,000,000 pounds. The royalty term continues in effect until September 8, 2027.
 
Examples of intellectual property we hold include patents addressing the conversion of PHA into articles such as diapers, feminine hygiene products, films, fibers, and molded articles, which protects our technology all the way to the “store shelf”.   In addition, we hold patents or applications as diverse as production systems, additives for bioplastics and unique specialty applications such as the use of materials in the oil and gas industry.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. In order to research, develop, and manufacture products for our customers and ultimately for consumer use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant consequences.
 
Some applications for which our biopolymers may be suitable, such as food packaging, PHA-coated paper cups and drinking straws, involve food contact, which, in the United States, is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Our PHA has been cleared for use in food-contact applications by the FDA. The PHA polymer is also contained on positive lists for food-contact in the European Union and Japan. We are in the process of seeking further regulatory approvals necessary to sell and produce our products based on local requirements in various jurisdictions worldwide, and we are prepared to seek additional such approvals as may become necessary in the ordinary course of business.
 
Biobased and Biodegradability Certification
 
Our biopolymers in neat form have the advantage in the marketplace of being both biobased and biodegradable while having comparable functional properties to petroleum-based polymers. Our products may be certified for both biodegradability and composting. We obtain such certifications from recognized certifying bodies for our base products. As customers purchase product for a specific use, the customer typically obtains an updated certification covering the customer’s manufacturing specifications.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 190 total employees located in the United States. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe we have a good relationship with our employees.
