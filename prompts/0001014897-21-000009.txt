ITEM 1. BUSINESS


Global Arena Holding Inc. (“the Company”), a Delaware corporation, is organized as a holding company. The Company became a public company on May 18, 2011 when it successfully completed a reverse merger with China Stationery and Office Supply, Inc., an OTC Bulletin Board company. 

The Company currently has three subsidiary companies: 

The Company, GAHI Acquisition, Tidewater Energy Group and GES do not trade crypto currency, nor do they participate in Initial Coin Offerings. 

1) Global Election Services (GES)
 GES was formed on February 25, 2015, provides comprehensive technology-enabled paper absentee/mail ballot and Online election services to organizations such as craft and trade organizations, labor unions, political parties, co-operatives and housing organizations, associations and professional societies, universities, and political organizations. GES has developed proprietary election software for a data storage and retrieval registration system to determine voter eligibility and prevent duplicate votes with In-Person digital signature capture, as well as proprietary election software for scanning/tabulation utilizing advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode imaging software featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. This system provides 3 types of audit capabilities. The hardware includes high speed optical scanners that are hard lined to a computer with all Wi-Fi disabled so the entire tabulation process occurs offline, eliminating the opportunity for hacking. 

GES is also working with multiple vendors and has made investments in companies who are developing Blockchain Technology for a data storage and retrieval registration system; tabulation of paper Absentee/Mail Ballots; and Internet voting.

The Company has also signed a letter of Intent to acquire the assets of Election Services Solutions including all clients, contracts and employment contracts. This asset purchase is currently pending. 

GES Acquisition of Election Services Solutions, LLC 
 On May 10, 2019, the Company entered into an amended asset purchase agreement with Election Services Solutions, LLC. Under the amended APA, the Company will purchase 100% of the assets of Election Services Solutions, LLC. The Company will pay $550,000, of which $511,150 has already been paid, and issue 20,000,000 common shares to purchase these assets under this amended APA. GES derived over 80 % of its current business from Election Services Solutions. The closing of this transaction will occur upon the approval of certain corporate actions at the 2021 annual meeting.

The ESS asset acquisition will give GES the ability to expand into the following areas: 
 ·
 Alumni Associations – The ESS team formally ran elections for Alumni organizations for over 25 years with memberships from 5,000 to 200,000. 
 ·
 Labor Unions – The ESS Management team has a 39-year history in administering elections to organized labor unions.
 ·

4

·
 Professional Trade Associations – The ESS team formerly ran elections for Professional Trade Associations for over 25 years with memberships from 30,000 to 50,000. 
 ·
 Awards and Contests – The ESS team ran multiple public shows for the Country Music Awards in 2006, 2007 and 2008. These awards are all online voting, so we will have the ability to effectively reengage in that field. 

GES Current Business
 As one of the United States premier provider of comprehensive election services, GES focus on efficiency, accuracy, integrity and security. GES prides itself on being able to provide flawless results regardless of the size or complexity of the project. GES helps organizations manage elections, strengthen corporate governance, increase member participation and reduce costs. 

Today’s election officials take on tremendous responsibility in managing all aspects of the voting process from selecting products to ensuring fair elections and every phase in between. In an industry that is constantly evolving, these tasks become more challenging every day. GES provides full-service technology enabled election solutions to clients while offering the experience, support, security and capacity needed to meet ever-changing client needs now and in the future. GES believes it is unique in its ability to integrate multiple methods of voting; customers can hold elections via Paper Ballots by mail or in person, Internet Voting, or any combination of these methods, which GES refers to as Hybrid elections. Every project begins with a formal review of the bylaws to ensure total compliance. GES then prepares a formal project plan and timeline. An experienced Election Administrator manages every facet of the project, while keeping the client fully informed every step of the way. GES provides telephone and/or email support for any procedural questions and help for management as well as voters. GES projects enhance the image of professionalism of the client organization, providing our clients with peace of mind every step of the way. 

The GES’s senior management team has conducted approximately over 8,600 elections, involving more than 40,000,000 voters. Each organized labor election result requires an election certification submitted to the US Department of Labor, and for over 39 years, not one of our elections has been overturned. 

Election security is an absolute priority for GES. We have seen emotions run high in many projects. Our focus on the security and confidentiality of election information diffuses most concerns and creates a broad consensus that the project is being conducted correctly and impartially. Election Committees regularly observe our processing and tabulation activities. 

Paper Ballots; Absentee/Mail and In-Person Voting
GES management has been handling paper mail ballot and in-person elections for Labor Unions, Associations and other private organizations for over 40 years. This process starts with a nominations meeting, creation and printing of the ballot and all materials. For an Absentee/Mail election, ballots are mailed to the eligible voting members. On the voting/tabulation day, we collect the mail and use the proprietary registration system that we developed to authenticate and register voters by scanning a barcode on the Business Reply Mail envelope with the ballot inside. For an in-person election, voters are authenticated in our system and they sign a digital signature pad for registration. The authentication is based on a database provided by the client and any ineligible or challenged votes are removed. Once this list of valid voters has been compiled, we open the envelopes with identifiers and pull out the secret ballot envelope containing the ballot. Once the ballots are pulled from the secret ballot envelopes, we scan them using our proprietary software and hardware system to tabulate the votes. We uphold the essential requirements that the vote is secret, and each voter only gets one vote. 

Management believes there is a unique opportunity in conducting United States and Foreign Government Elections. GES’ senior Management teams’ primary business for 40 years has been mail/absentee ballot elections. The market for GES conducting paper/mail ballot elections grew exponentially in January of 2017, when first President Barack Obama, and then President Donald Trump designated U.S. Elections “Critical Infrastructure”. In the U.S. there are 3,007 counties, 64 parishes, 19 organized boroughs, 11 census areas, 41 independent cities, and the District of Columbia, all of whom purchase updated Election Machines and Software. Each municipal county individually 

5
 purchases election voting machines under the guidance of their own State’s Secretary of State. The United States Government, through the Elections Assistance Commission, certifies election software and hardware for use in U.S. Government Elections. The certification process usually takes 6 months and companies applying for certification usually spend up to $750,000. The Company has engaged software and hardware developers, whom GES is working with to begin the qualification process for U.S. certification. This will require the hiring of additional technical software employees, and additional outside vendors who in initial discussions are interested in stock-based compensation. The closing of this transaction will occur upon the approval of certain corporate actions at the 2021 annual meeting.

Organized Labor/Unions 
 Organized Labor Unions and their memberships in the United States are represented at the Local level, the Regional level and the International level. The smallest membership totals are at the Local level, groups of locals in a geographical area combine to make up a Regional level, and all members belong to an International Level. Elections occur in all these groups and subsets of them, which means that there could be multiple votes for the same union throughout the year, with GES charging a per-member fee for each one. Most Nominations and Officer Elections for union leaders occur every two to three years. Additionally, GES is regularly involved in other types of elections, including; Strike Votes, Contract Ratifications, Delegate Nominations, Dues Increases, Assessments, By-Law Changes and Unexpired Term Votes, all of which can be done online. Each union has by-laws that dictate the process and how often these elections occur. Due to our experience, it is a natural progression for GES to expand into administering Regional and International elections, which GES has already begun to do.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Department of Labor released official guidelines for voting online. Since then, we have worked to develop our systems to offer our customers the most advanced software available today. The DOL announcement has encouraged many unions to look into this option because it is not only a more efficient process, there is a significant cost savings for the client and a margin increase for GES. 

Residential Organizations, Co-op/Condos 
 GES has been conducting elections for Homeowner and Co-Op Organizations for more than thirty years. At GES, we understand the sensitivity of the project, and the need to present a flawless experience to the owners. GES is the independent and impartial third-party Organizations can trust to manage an election and provide an Organization with the tools essential to strong leadership and good governance. GES provides complete management of an election project, from initial design of voting materials through tabulation. We support in-person, paper mail, and Internet voting using ballots or proxies. Signature verification, slates, and weighted, or share, voting are standard. No activity proceeds unless there is a quorum present. Interim results are available immediately and certified results normally follow within 24 hours. The GES Team has conducted elections at properties with fewer than 200 Membership Interests, and with more than 10,000. We have also conducted lotteries for public housing agencies including Section 8 Housing. 

Now more than ever it is important to know what property owners are thinking. For many clients, we've included a limited set of survey questions on the proxy for the Board election. This technique has proven effective in capturing voter interest and stimulating turnout, in addition to providing valuable feedback on the important issues. GES can develop a regular program of surveys to help the client more effectively gauge members' views on needed improvements, regulatory matters, or other association-related issues. This interaction is made even easier with our working relationship with Voting Portals LLC. 

GES Developed Election Technology
 Voter Authentication and Registration Software
 GES has worked diligently to create a very specific proprietary registration election software that functions in authenticating and registering voting members in a data look-up system. In the event of an In-Person election, a voter ID can be scanned, or any information typed in to pull that voter up. A digital signature is then captured and saved to complete the voter’s registration and is available in a final list of ‘Who Voted”. In the event of a Mail 

6
 Ballot, a barcode on a Business Reply Envelope is scanned and the status of that member is identified. If the member is not eligible to vote, that ballot is removed from the count. Additionally, if a member requests a replacement ballot and mails back that and the original, the system will flag the duplicate ballot, which would be removed ensuring only one ballot from each voter is counted. Because we must account for every single ballot, the system has multiple reporting options where we may deliver to the client the list of members who mailed in a ballot but were not able to vote, detailing the reason.

Scanning and Tabulation Software 
 The GES proprietary scanning election software is advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode scanning and tabulation software featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. The computer hardware utilizes high-speed optical scanners and was designed to run without Internet or Wi-Fi access and is hard wired, ensuring complete security. The system allows for triple auditing capabilities, which are; electronically generated tabulation results, jpeg imaging and storage, and the original physical ballot. This advancement gives GES the ability to tabulate elections faster and more efficiently and brings the opportunity for GES to compete for larger elections. GES began successfully deploying this system in our elections during the third quarter of 2017. 
Communication Software
 GES is working to provide our current and future clients with the ability to create instant communication and feedback with their members, using any social media device available today.

GES is building an interface for communication and connection to:
 Communicate a Message – An organization can get their message out clearly in the form required, without any unwanted media spin, bias, filtering or comment.
 Fine Tune Policies – Test-drive policies and projects with immediate response, allowing for responsive adjustments to be made to make a message more acceptable to the community.
 Build a Positive Image – Enhancing the concept of ‘open communication’ and ‘democratic politics’, which leads to an enhanced positive perception of leaders by their constituents.
 Learn More About a Group – Learning more about a group’s preferences and opinions on an infinite number of topics can help the Organization, Institution or League and leaders can better serve its community and meet their needs in a variety of ways. 

Management believes this type of software capabilities will give GES a unique opportunity to offer clients the ability to communicate in real time with their members; raising issues of concern, polling the attitude of their constituencies, interacting in question and answer seminars in addition to conducting elections that GES certifies.
 In short, this software can be used in multiple formats for people to communicate instantly on issues of importance. The closing of this transaction will occur upon the approval of certain corporate actions at the 2021 annual meeting.

Online Voting 
 GES has a current client base of hundreds of unions. GES is committed to providing a comprehensive, secure voting platform, using state of the art technology for election officials charged with running their elections. GES has joint ventured with Voting Portals LLC, to use a proprietary software that not only allows for secure online voting, but also includes add-on features for our clients in a secure portal system such as posting documents like candidate statements, contracts or amendments to be voted on, streaming real-time or archived meetings or videos, sending real-time messages within the portal or tracking email communication to the membership. We also offer the option for a “hybrid” election, which allows members to choose a Mail Ballot, In Person and/or Online Voting options, while ensuring no one votes twice. GES is working to build a user experience that limits human error and makes the voting process as easy and seamless as possible while ensuring the highest level of secrecy, security and One Voter = One Vote integrity that we have been committed to for nearly 4 decades. 

In 2020, GES developed, built and implemented a propriety online election voting solution that is compliant with Title IV of the United States Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards. GES built the platform on one of the most secure global infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is a comprehensive, evolving platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform as a 

7
 service and packaged software (PaaS), and software as a service offerings (SaaS). The platform enables GES to protect individual client data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention (if required). All data flowing across the global network interconnects with the GES secured data center and is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. Additional encryption layers exist as well. GES controls where our client data is stored, who can access it, and what resources your organization is utilizing at any given moment. Fine-grain identity and access controls combined with continuous monitoring for near real-time security information ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times, wherever your information is stored. GES encryption software uses AES 256 with a cryptographic key using a RSA elliptic curve of 4096, which is used to encrypt the communication of the client and the GES server, as well all client data hosted in the server. A six-digit security code, delivered to the voter’s email address provided by the client, must be validated by the prospective voter in order to authenticate the identity of the voter before the voter may access the ballot. After validating the voter, the voter then votes anomalously, so that the identity of the voter and the ballot cast can never be matched. The GES voting platform verifies that the users does not use the back and forward browser button, a safe mechanism against tampering. Distributed denial of service DDoS protection tools help secure websites and applications and prevent DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with traffic traditionally delivered via “botnets" that are created by networked endpoints connected via malware. The DDoS software protection provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latenc. GES will also need shares available thru an Employee Share Option program to hire and retain qualified personal. The closing of this transaction and the hiring of qualified employees will occur upon the approval of certain corporate actions at the 2021 annual meeting.

1)  GES further expanded its track record in the 1st quarter of 2020 by entering the private government election space when GES successfully completed the Statewide Presidential Primary for North Dakota Democratic-NPL. GES administered the statewide polling for all North Dakota residents who wished to vote in Democratic Presidential Primary by; managing a call center and processed over 3,000 mail ballot requests, set up equipment and trained Staff on our proprietary Registration Software for In-Person voting at 14 locations across the state, and processed over 14,000 ballots with our proprietary Scanning and Tabulation software system.
GES’ IT staff customized our proprietary Voter Registration software to ensure voters cast only one ballot, whether by mail or in person and set up secure servers that processed voter sign-in and digital signature capture in real time from a database of over 600,000 potential voters. GES trained over 100 volunteers, many with limited or no technology experience on how to use the system. After a short tutorial, those volunteers handled the increased registration volume with ease. After the polls closed and all the votes were cast, GES’ tabulation systems processed the ballots using our proprietary Scanning and Tabulation software system. The 2020 North Dakota Democratic-NPL Presidential Primary caucus had the largest voter turnout in over a decade.

Management believes there is a unique opportunity in conducting United States and Foreign Government Elections. GES’ senior Management teams’ primary business for 40 years has been mail/absentee ballot elections. The market for GES conducting paper/mail ballot elections grew exponentially in January of 2017, when first President Barack Obama, and then President Donald Trump designated U.S. Elections “Critical Infrastructure”. The effect of these Executive Orders was to refocus the Department of Homeland Security, and the Elections Assistance Commission to reenergize compliance on U.S. Government elections, and assist by making available resources such as intelligence, funding, training and best practices in election software and hardware, for all 50 States. 

On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 into law, which included $380 million in Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants for states to make election security improvements. Among the authorized uses of the grant funds is the replacement of voting equipment, specifically equipment that does not produce a paper record or that is determined to be at the end of its useful life. Recent published examples are:

·
 On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 into law. The Act includes $425 million in new HAVA funds made available.
 ·
 In 2019, Hawaii (SB 166) allocated $789,598 for the purpose of a vote counting system contract.
 ·
 In 2019, Georgia issued a $150 million bond package for the replacement of voting equipment statewide. The state also appropriated $12,840,000 from the General Fund for the purpose of financing projects and facilities for the Office of Secretary of State.

The opportunity for mail/absentee ballots became a page one story in 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Subsequent accusations of voter fraud, compounded by President Trump declaring the 2020 U.S. election voting as rigged and fraudulent, has led to almost 40% of the U.S. Electorate believing the 2020 election was fraudulent.

On October 23, 2019, the Brennan Center has estimated that the national cost for some of the most critical election security measures to be approximately $ 2.2 Billion dollars over the next five years. The opportunity is even greater in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to social distancing requirements, voters should not be congregating at polling locations for In-Person voting. Mail and Absentee Ballot voting has emerged as a safe alternative to In-Person voting and which is a complicated process that requires a company like GES that has significant experience in conducting Mail Ballot voting to avoid problems.

 Most states have a vote by mail process right now. Voters may request an Absentee Mail Ballot from their County Board of Elections or a Vote by Mail ballot is sent. In either case, our proprietary registration and tabulation software has an immediate need. In the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, approximately 33 Million ballots were cast by mail making up about 25% of the votes. Most individuals think only of the Presidential election every four years as the Election. In reality, municipal Board of Elections throughout the U.S. are conducting elections annually for such elected positions as; Governor, Mayor, City Council, State Assembly, State Senate, Members of U.S. Congress (House every 2 years, Senate every 6) Civil and Criminal Justices, Sheriffs, School Boards, Village Trustees, etc. In short, most State and local municipal Board of Elections are in the market purchasing software and hardware every year.

In the U.S. there are 3,007 counties, 64 parishes, 19 organized boroughs, 11 census areas, 41 independent cities, and the District of Columbia, all of whom must buy updated Election Machines and Software. Each municipal county individually purchases election voting machines under the guidance of their own State’s Secretary of State.

The United States Government, through the Elections Assistance Commission, certifies election software and hardware for use in U.S. Government Elections. On February 10, 2021 the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) announced the adoption of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0. These guidelines have been formulated to improve cyber security, accessibility and usability requirements in the U.S. voting process.

4) Tidewater Energy Group was formed for the purpose of creating diversification for the Company. Directed by Jason Old, Tidewater Energy Group brings a number of seasoned, well-respected members of the Energy Industry to the Company. 

The new age of unconventional drilling has reset the life cycle of the exploration and production industry. Beginning in the mid-2000’s, management teams and their private equity sponsors were able to deploy capital and realize gains quickly by building contiguous acreage positions that they flipped to larger operators. This added value by creating high working interest, horizontal drilling locations and resulted in extremely high IRRs with low equity multiples.

As public companies and larger private independents secured their acreage positions, drilling locations became less attractive in the short-term. Public valuations soon became depressed, partially due to their expensive drilling inventory, the values of which would take time to realize (i.e. drill). Simultaneously, commodity prices began to fall, further reducing the value of upside.

Larger companies are now focused on acquiring production that is immediately accretive, and we are beginning to see consolidation. Assets are now priced on current production with little to no value given to upside. Management believes this creates an opportunity for Tidewater Energy Group Inc., for the following reasons:

13
 ·
 Consolidation drives disposition of “non-core” assets
 ·
 Tidewater Energy Group Inc can protect its downside by purchasing stable, low-risk cash flow at a discount
 ·
 Tidewater Energy Group Inc technical team is uniquely positioned to cherry pick those opportunities with attractive upside through recompletions, workovers, and development drilling
