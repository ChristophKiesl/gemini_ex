ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that improve the quality of life for downstream consumers and promote a sustainable future. Our products comprise a broad range of innovative chemicals and formulations that bring color and vibrancy to a variety of applications, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption. We market our products globally to a diversified group of industrial customers through two segments: Titanium Dioxide, which consists of our TiO2 business, and Performance Additives, which consists of our functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment businesses. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including those within TiO2, color pigments and functional additives, a leading North American producer of timber treatment products and a leading European producer of water treatment products. Headquartered in Wynyard, U.K., we employ approximately 4,000 associates worldwide and sell our products in more than 110 countries. We became an independent publicly traded company following our IPO and separation from Huntsman Corporation in August 2017.
We operate in a variety of end markets, including industrial and architectural paints and coatings, plastics, construction materials, paper, printing inks, pharmaceuticals, food, cosmetics, fibers and films and personal care. Within these end markets, our products serve approximately 4,100 customers globally. Our production capabilities allow us to manufacture a broad range of high quality functional TiO2 products as well as specialty and differentiated TiO2 products that provide critical performance for our customers and sell at a premium for certain end-use applications. Our functional additives, color pigments and timber treatment products provide essential properties for our customers’ end-use applications by enhancing the color and appearance of construction materials and delivering performance benefits in other applications such as corrosion and fade resistance, water repellence and flame suppression. We believe that our global footprint and broad product offerings differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to better meet our customers’ needs.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had total revenues of $2,130 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $194 million, which includes $197 million from our Titanium Dioxide segment and $47 million from our Performance Additives segment.
Our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments have evolved in recent years through certain site closures, reductions in operating costs and new product introductions. We have a well-established position in each of the industries in which we operate. We continue to implement business improvements within our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments which are expected to provide incremental benefit in our earnings as these programs are achieved.
The table below summarizes the key products, end markets and applications, representative customers, revenues and sales information by segment as of December 31, 2019.

Operating Segment Information" and "Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Our Business
Venator manufactures high quality TiO2, functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment products. Our broad product range, coupled with our ability to develop and supply specialized products into technically exacting end-use applications, has positioned us as a leader in the markets we serve. We are a leader in the specialty and differentiated TiO2 industry segments, which includes products that sell at a premium and have more stable margins than functional TiO2. We also have complementary functional additives, color pigments, timber treatment and water treatment 
businesses. We have 23 manufacturing facilities operating in nine countries with a total nameplate production capacity of approximately 1.2 million metric tons per year, excluding our plant in Pori, Finland, ongoing closure of which was announced in the third quarter of 2018. Of these facilities, seven are TiO2 manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia, and 16 are color pigments, functional additives, water treatment and timber treatment manufacturing and processing facilities in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were $2,130 million.
Titanium Dioxide Segment
TiO2 is derived from titanium-bearing ores and is a white inert pigment that provides whiteness, opacity and brightness to thousands of everyday items, including coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers, food and personal care products. We own a portfolio of brands, including the TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC® and ALTIRIS® ranges, the products for which are produced in our seven manufacturing facilities around the globe (excluding our plant in Pori, Finland, ongoing closure of which was announced in the third quarter of 2018). We service over 1,700 customers in most major industries and geographic regions. Our global manufacturing footprint allows us to service the needs of both local and global customers, including AkzoNobel, Ampacet, BASF, Clariant, DSM, Flint, LyondellBasell, PPG, PolyOne, Sherwin-Williams and Sun Chemical. Annual industry demand for TiO2 products tends to correlate with GDP growth rates over time and is seasonal. This seasonality is subject to global, regional, end-use application and other factors.
We are among the largest global TiO2 producers, with nameplate production capacity of approximately 652,000 metric tons per year. We are able to manufacture a broad range of high quality TiO2 products for functional, differentiated and specialty applications. Our specialty and differentiated product grades generally sell at a premium into more specialized applications such as fibers, catalysts, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. 
There are two manufacturing processes for the production of TiO2; the sulfate process and the chloride process. We believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately 45% of global production capacity. Most end-use applications can use pigments produced by either process, although there are markets that prefer pigment from a specific manufacturing route—for example, the inks market prefers sulfate products whereas the automotive coatings market prefers chloride products. Regional customers typically favor products that are available locally. The sulfate process produces TiO2 in both the rutile and anatase forms, the latter being used in certain high-value specialty applications. Our production capabilities are distinguished from some of our competitors because of our ability to manufacture high quality TiO2 using both sulfate and chloride manufacturing processes, which gives us the flexibility to tailor our products to meet our customers’ needs. By operating both sulfate and chloride processes, we also have the ability to use a wide range of titanium feedstocks, which enhances the competitiveness of our manufacturing operations, by providing flexibility in the selection of raw materials. This mitigates, to some extent, fluctuations in availability for any particular feedstock and allows us to manage our raw material costs. 
Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced using either the chloride or sulfate process, it is "finished" into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications. Co-products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal to comply with environmental regulations. In order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness, we have developed and marketed the co-products from the manufacture of titanium dioxide at our facilities. We sell approximately 45% of the co-products generated by our TiO2 business.

We have a broad customer base and have successfully differentiated our business by establishing ourselves as a market leader in a variety of niche end-use applications where the innovation and specialization of our products is rewarded with higher growth prospects and strong customer relationships.

Color Pigments. We are a leading global producer of colored inorganic pigments for the construction, coatings, plastics and specialty markets. We are one of three global leaders in the manufacture and processing of liquid, powder and granulated forms of iron oxide color pigments. We also sell complex inorganic colored pigments, carbon black and metal carboxylate driers. The cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength of iron oxide make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings and plastics. We produce a wide range of color pigments and are the world’s second largest manufacturer of technical grade ultramarine blue pigments, which have a unique blue shade and are widely used to correct colors, giving them a desirable clean, blue undertone. These attributes have resulted in ultramarine blue being used world-wide for polymeric applications such as construction plastics, food packaging, automotive polymers, consumer plastics, as well as coatings and cosmetics.
Our products are sold under a portfolio of brands that are targeted to the construction sector such as DAVIS COLORS®, GRANUFIN® and FERROXIDE® and the following brands Holliday Pigments, COPPERAS RED® and MAPICO® focused predominantly on the coatings and plastics sectors.
Our products are also used by manufacturers of colorants, rubber, paper, cosmetics, pet food, digital ink, toner and other industrial uses delivering benefits in other applications such as corrosion protection and catalysis.
Our construction customers value our broad product range and benefit from our custom blending, color matching and color dosing systems. Our coatings customers benefit from a consistent and quality product.

 | Iron Oxides | Ultramarines | Specialty InorganicChemicals | Driers 
Characteristics | Powdered, granulated or in liquid form synthesized from a range of feedstocks | Range of ultramarine blue and violet and also manganese violet pigments | Complex inorganic pigments and cadmium pigments | A range of metal carboxylates and driers
Typical Applications | Construction, coatings, plastics, cosmetics, inks, catalyst and laminates | Predominantly used in plastics and also coatings and cosmetics | Coatings, plastics and inks | Predominantly coatings 


Copperas, iron and alkali are raw materials for the manufacture of iron oxide pigments. They are used to produce colored pigment particles which are further processed into a finished pigment in powder, liquid, granule or blended powder form. Iron oxide pigment’s cost effectiveness, weather resistance, chemical and thermal stability and coloring strength make it an ideal colorant for construction materials, such as concrete, brick and roof tile, and for coatings such as paints and plastics. We are one of the three largest synthetic color pigments producers which together represent more than 50% of the global market for iron oxide pigments. The remaining market share consists primarily of competitors based in China.

Made from clay, our ultramarine blue pigments are non-toxic, weather resistant and thermally stable. Ultramarine blue pigments are used world-wide for food contact applications and are used extensively in plastics and the paint industry. Our ultramarine pigments are permitted for unrestricted use in certain cosmetics applications. We focus on supplying our customers with technical grade ultramarine blues and violets to high specification markets such as the cosmetics industry.

Timber Treatment and Water Treatment. We manufacture wood protection chemicals used primarily in residential and commercial applications to prolong the service life of wood through protection from decay and fungal or insect attack. Wood that has been treated with our products is primarily sold to consumers through major branded retail outlets.
We manufacture our timber treatment chemicals in the U.S. and market our products primarily in North America through Viance, LLC ("Viance"), our 50%-owned joint venture with Dupont de Nemours, Inc ("DuPont"). Our residential construction products such as ACQ, ECOLIFE™ and Copper Azole are sold for use in decking, fencing and other residential outdoor wood structures. Our industrial construction products such as Chromated Copper Arsenate are sold for use in telephone poles and salt water piers and pilings.
We manufacture our water treatment chemicals in Germany, and these products are used to improve water purity in industrial, commercial and municipal applications. We are one of Europe’s largest suppliers of polyaluminium chloride-based flocculants with approximately 140,000 metric tons of production capacity. Our main markets are municipal and industrial waste water treatment and the paper industry.
Customers, Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Titanium Dioxide Segment
We serve over 1,200 customers through our Titanium Dioxide segment. These customers produce paints and coatings, plastics, paper, printing inks, fibers and films, pharmaceuticals, food and cosmetics.
Our ten largest customers accounted for 23% of the segment’s sales in 2019 and no single TiO2 customer represented more than 10% of our sales in 2019. Approximately 85% of our TiO2 sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network. This network enables us to work directly with our customers and develop a deep understanding of our customers’ needs resulting in valuable relationships. The remaining 15% of sales are made through our distribution network. We maximize the reach of our distribution network by utilizing specialty distributors in selected markets.
Larger customers are typically served via our own sales network and these customers often have annual volume targets with associated pricing mechanisms. Smaller customers are served through a combination of our global sales teams and a distribution network, and the route to market decision is often dependent upon customer size and end-use application.
Our focus is on marketing products and services to higher growth and higher value applications. For example, we believe that our Titanium Dioxide segment is well-positioned to benefit from sectors such as fibers and films, catalysts, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food, where customers’ needs are complex resulting in fewer companies that have the capability to support them. We maximize reach through specialty distributors in selected markets. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products.
Performance Additives Segment
We serve over 2,900 customers through our Performance Additives segment. These customers produce materials for the construction industry, as well as coatings, plastics, pharmaceutical, personal care and catalyst applications.
Our ten largest customers accounted for 19% of the segment’s sales in 2019 and no single Performance Additives customer represented more than 10% of our sales in 2019. Performance Additives segment sales are made directly to customers through our own global sales and technical services network, in addition to utilizing distributors. Our focused sales effort, technical expertise, strong customer service and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve leading market positions in a number of the countries where we manufacture our products. We sell iron oxides primarily through our global sales force whereas our ultramarine sales are predominantly through distributors. We sell the majority of our timber treatment products directly to end customers via our joint venture, Viance.

Joint Ventures
LPC is our 50%-owned joint venture with Kronos. We share production offtake and operating costs of the plant with Kronos, though we market our share of the production independently. The operations of the joint venture are under the direction 
of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation. Our investment in LPC is accounted for using the equity method.
Viance is our 50%-owned joint venture with DuPont. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it was announced that DuPont and International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc. ("IFF") entered into a definitive agreement for the merger of IFF and DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences business. We do not anticipate that this merger will have a material impact on our business. The merger is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Upon closure, it is expected that DuPont’s interest in Viance will transfer to IFF. Viance markets our timber treatment products. Our joint venture interest in Viance was acquired as part of the Rockwood acquisition. The joint venture sources all of its products through a contract manufacturing arrangement at our Harrisburg, North Carolina facility, and we bear a disproportionate amount of working capital risk of loss due to the supply arrangement whereby we control manufacturing on Viance’s behalf. As a result, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of Viance into our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Pacific Iron Products Sdn Bhd ("PIP") is our 50%-owned joint venture with Coogee Chemicals Pty. Ltd. that manufactures products for Venator. It was determined that the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance are raw material supply, manufacturing and sales. In this joint venture we supply all the raw materials through a fixed cost supply contract, operate the manufacturing facility and market the products of the joint venture to customers. Through a fixed price raw materials supply contract with the joint venture we are exposed to the risk related to the fluctuation of raw material pricing. We concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and as a result we consolidate the assets, liabilities and operating results of PIP into our consolidated and combined financial statements.
Raw Materials
Titanium Dioxide Segment
The primary raw materials that are used to produce TiO2 are various types of titanium feedstock, which include ilmenite, rutile, titanium slag (chloride slag and sulfate slag) and synthetic rutile. The world market for titanium-bearing ores has a diverse range of suppliers with the four largest accounting for approximately 40% of global supply. The majority of our titanium-bearing ores are sourced from Canada, Africa, Australia and India. Ore accounts for approximately 50% of TiO2 variable manufacturing costs, while utilities (electricity, gas and steam), sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately 30% of variable manufacturing costs.
The majority of the titanium-bearing ores market is transacted on short-term contracts, or longer-term volume contracts with market-based pricing re-negotiated several times per year. This form of market-based ore contract provides flexibility and responsiveness in terms of pricing and quantity obligations.
Performance Additives Segment
Our primary raw materials for our Performance Additives segment are as follows:

 | FunctionalAdditives | Color Pigments | TimberTreatment | WaterChemicals 
Primary raw materials | Barium and zinc based inorganics | Iron oxide particles, scrap iron, copperas, alkali | DCOIT, copper, monoethanolamine | Aluminum hydroxide


The primary raw materials for functional additives production are barite and zinc. We currently source barite from China, where we have long standing supplier relationships and pricing is negotiated largely on a purchase by purchase basis. The quality of zinc required for our business is mainly mined in Australia but can also be sourced from Canada and South America. The majority of our zinc is sourced from two key suppliers with whom we have long standing relationships.
We source our raw material for the majority of our color pigments business from China, the U.S., France and Italy. Key raw materials are iron powder and metal scrap that are sourced from various mid-size and smaller producers primarily on a spot contract basis.
The primary raw materials for our timber treatment business are dichloro-octylisothiazolinone ("DCOIT") and copper. We source the raw materials for the majority of our timber treatment business from China and the U.S. DCOIT is sourced on a long-term contract whereas copper is procured from various mid-size and larger producers primarily on a spot basis.
The primary raw materials for our water treatment business are aluminum hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, which are widely available from a number of sources and typically sourced through long-term contracts. We also use sulfuric acid which we source internally.
Competition
The global markets in which our business operates are highly competitive and vary according to segment.
Titanium Dioxide Segment
Competition for Titanium Dioxide products is based on price, product quality and service. Our key competitors are The Chemours Company, Tronox Holdings plc ("Tronox"), Kronos Worldwide Inc. and Lomon Billions each of which has the ability to service global markets. Unlike our chloride technology, the sulfate based TiO2 technology used by our Titanium Dioxide segment is widely available. Accordingly, barriers to entry, apart from capital availability, may be low. The entrance of new competitors into the industry, the ability of existing or future competitors to increase production in low cost markets, and the development of proprietary technology that enables current or future competitors to produce functional grade products at a significantly lower cost, could render our technology uneconomic and reduce our ability to capture improving margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing. 
Competition within the specialty and differentiated TiO2 markets is based on technical expertise in the customers’ applications, customer service, product attributes (such as product form and quality), and price. Product quality is particularly critical in the technically demanding applications in which we focus as inconsistent product quality adversely impacts consistency in the end-product. Our primary competitors within specialty and differentiated TiO2 applications include Fuji Titanium Industry, Kronos Worldwide Inc., ISK, Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Tayca Corporation and Precheza a.s.
Performance Additives Segment
Competition within the functional additives market is primarily based on application know-how, brand recognition, product quality and price. Key competitors for barium-based additives include Solvay S.A., Sakai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., 20 Microns Ltd., and various Chinese barium producers. Key competitors for zinc-based additives include various Chinese lithopone producers.
Competition within the color pigments market is based on price, product quality, technical capability, brand recognition and innovation. Our primary competitors within color pigments include Lanxess AG, Cathay Pigments Group, Ferro Corporation and Shanghai Yipin Pigments Co., Ltd.
Competition within the timber treatment market is based on price, customer support services, innovative technology, including sustainable solutions and product range. Our primary competitors are Lonza Group and Koppers Inc. 
Competition within the water treatment market is based on proximity to customers and price. Our primary competitors are Kemira Oyj and Feralco Group.
Intellectual Property
Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses, and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses. When appropriate, we file patent and trademark applications, often on a global basis, for new product development technologies. For example, we have obtained patents and trademark registrations covering relevant jurisdictions for key product platforms related to Functional Pigments and Additives and Active Materials technologies. These platforms are used for solar reflection (ALTIRIS® pigments), to keep colored surfaces cooler when they are exposed to the sun, enhance air purification, improve catalytic processes (HOMBIKAT®) or lead to products that help manage heat in plastic applications or lead to metal deactivation in cables (SACHTOLITH®). 
We own a total of approximately 642 issued patents and pending patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes approximately 41 issued U.S. patents, 396 patents issued in countries outside the U.S., and 205 pending patent applications, worldwide. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. During 2019, we reviewed our patent 
portfolio to ensure it was aligned with our commercial interests and determined to abandon a number of patents to reduce the costs of maintaining our patent portfolio. This resulted in a reduction in our patent portfolio of over 300 issued patents.
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.
In addition to our own patents, patent applications, proprietary trade secrets and know-how, we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets, know-how and related technology and/or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities. We also have licensed or sub-licensed intellectual property rights to third parties.
Certain of our products are well-known brand names and we have approximately 950 global trademark registrations and applications. Some of these registrations and applications include filings under the Madrid system for the international registration of marks and may confer rights in multiple countries. However, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. In our Titanium Dioxide segment, we consider our TIOXIDE®, HOMBITAN®, HOMBITEC®, UVTITAN®, HOMBIKAT™, DELTIO® and ALTIRIS® trademarks to be valuable assets. In our Performance Additives segment, we consider BLANC FIXE™, GRANUFIN®, SACHTOLITH®, FERROXIDE®, ECOLIFE™ and NICASAL® trademarks to be valuable assets.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
General
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In the U.S., these laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), as well as the state counterparts of these statutes.
In the EU, we are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety related provisions. EU regulations are automatically applicable to EU member states from the date they enter into force, while directives become binding upon incorporation into member states' national legislation. Incorporation of directives into national law must take place by the deadline set by the relevant directive, usually within two years. Applicable laws include Directive 2004/35/CE on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, Directive 2008/98/EC on waste ("Waste Framework Directive"), Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, the Seveso-III Directive on prevention of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, Directive 2000/60/EC known as the EU Water Framework Directive, Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions and Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"). Additionally, member states operate their own domestic legislation where not prescribed by EU law, including in the core areas of health and safety in the workplace, statutory nuisance and land contamination legislation, which are subject to national jurisdiction.
Following a referendum in June 2016, in which a majority of voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the EU, the U.K. government initiated the process to leave the EU, which resulted in the U.K. leaving the EU on January 31, 2020 (often referred to as "Brexit"). The U.K. is now in a "transition period" until December 31, 2020, during which time EU rules and regulations applicable to U.K. businesses will continue to remain in force. The future effects of Brexit remain unknown and will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU or other markets beyond the transitional period. Although a no-deal Brexit was avoided in January 2020, there is no certainty that a similar result will be avoided at the end of 2020. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what environmental regulatory implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU will have and how such withdrawal will affect our Company.
In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. In addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to EHS matters may also be found in other areas of this report including "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and "Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 23. Commitments and Contingencies —Other Proceedings and Note 24. Environmental, Health and Safety Matters."
We are subject to a wide array of laws governing chemicals, including the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") in the U.S., and REACH, and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation ("CLP") regulation in Europe. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Several other countries, including Turkey and Russia, have announced that they will be introducing similar systems in the future. In addition, a number of countries where we operate, including the U.K., have adopted rules to conform chemical labeling in accordance with the globally harmonized system. Many of these foreign regulatory regimes are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for these rules. For example, the Globally Harmonised System ("GHS") established a uniform system for the classification, labeling and packaging of certain chemical substances and the European Chemicals Agency ("ECHA") is currently in the process of determining if certain chemicals should be proposed to the European Commission to receive a carcinogenic classification.
Certain of our products are being evaluated under CLP regulation and their classification could negatively impact sales. On May 31, 2016, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety ("ANSES") submitted a proposal to ECHA that would classify TiO2 as a Category 1B Carcinogen presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans by inhalation. On June 8, 2017, the ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment ("RAC") announced its preliminary conclusion that certain evidence meets the criteria under CLP to classify TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen (described by the EU regulation as appropriate for "suspected human carcinogens") for humans by inhalation. The RAC published their final opinion on September 14, 2017, which proposed that TiO2 be classified as a Category 2 carcinogen by inhalation. In addition, the RAC proposed a note in their opinion to the effect that coated particles must be evaluated to assess whether a higher category (Category 1B or 1A) should be applied and additional routes of exposure (oral or dermal) should be included. After discussion with Member States and stakeholders, the European Commission concluded without a vote of the Member States that the classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen under the CLP Regulation is an appropriate measure. The European Commission first presented the proposed wording for the Entry of TiO2 in Annex VI to the CLP Regulation on June 12, 2018, and this wording has since been further amended. The latest version was published in the Commission Delegated Regulation on October 4, 2019 and applies to TiO2 in powder form meeting the size criteria in the proposed note. The regulation was sent for scrutiny by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, and the scrutiny period came to an end on February 4, 2020. The regulation will enter into effect 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will apply as of October 1, 2021. Member States, however, may choose to apply the regulation at any time after publication.
Adoption of the Category 2 Carcinogen classification will require that many end-use products manufactured with TiO2 be classified and labeled as containing a potentially carcinogenic component, which could negatively impact public perception of products containing TiO2. Such classification will also affect our manufacturing operations by subjecting us to new workplace safety requirements that could significantly increase costs. In addition, any classification, use restriction, or authorization requirement for use imposed by ECHA could trigger heightened regulatory scrutiny in countries outside the EU based on health or safety grounds, which could have a wider adverse impact geographically on market demand for and prices of TiO2 or other products containing TiO2 and increase our compliance obligations outside the EU. Any increased regulatory scrutiny could affect consumer sentiment or limit the marketability of and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2, which could have spill-over, restrictive effects under other EU laws, e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives. The classification could also require that all waste meeting the powder specifications in the proposed note be handled as hazardous waste, as separately determined by each Member State, which could result in significant impacts on our customers’ products, wastes from our operations and the implementation of Circular Economy efforts within the EU. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny could lead to claims by our employees or consumers of such products alleging adverse health impacts. Finally, the classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen could lead the ECHA to evaluate other products with similar particle characteristics (such as iron oxides or functional additives) for human carcinogenic potential by inhalation, which may ultimately have similar negative impacts on other products within our portfolio.
Environmental, Health and Safety Systems
We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. We cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage EHS legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us.
Environmental Remediation
We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources. Based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost to remediate contaminated sites.
We are engaged in closure processes at two facilities in the EU and we are undertaking detailed assessments of the environmental status of these facilities as part of the closure processes. The assessment of the environmental status may lead to a requirement for environmental remediation as a part of any closure process. Although the detailed assessment of the environmental status at these facilities is not complete, based on available information, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements.
Under CERCLA and similar laws in other jurisdictions, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws, such as those in effect in the EU, can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. We have not been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at former facilities or third-party sites, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA.
Under the RCRA in the U.S. and similar laws in other jurisdictions, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. Similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities.
During 2018 and 2019, China implemented new laws and regulations covering environmental contamination and created the Ministry for Environment Protection. Based on available information we do not believe that these regulatory changes will have a material effect on our financial statements.
Climate Change
Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. Increasing presence of climate change at the top of the global political and media agenda may lead to further domestic regulations and international agreements and commitments to restrict GHG emissions, all of which can lead to the necessity for increased investment in innovative energy sources and increased capital expenditure. The scope and speed at which climate change may impact business is difficult to predict, but it is likely to become a growing issue.
At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a group of nations, including the EU, agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System ("ETS"), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol. The European Parliament has used a process to formalize "backloading"—the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. A sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. The 
European Commission has established a market stability reserve as a long term solution to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience. The reserve started operating in 2019. 
Stage 4 of the ETS will begin in 2021 and carry on to 2030, and will focus on increasing the pace of emissions cuts by reducing the overall emission allowances at an annual rate of 2.2% from 2021 onwards (compared to the current rate of 1.74%), in order to align with the EU's binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030. It is difficult to estimate at this stage what the cost impact of stage 4 of the ETS will be on our EU based business. The EU has also set a binding target of increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 27% of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030, and additional proposals have been made to increase the target to 35%. At the EU, steps are being taken to stabilize the ETS. The next UN talks on climate change will take place in the U.K. in November 2020.
In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which entered into effect in November 2016 (the "Paris Agreement"). Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In August 2017, the U.S. informed the United Nations that it is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and submitted its formal withdrawal application in November 2019, which would become effective in August 2020. The Paris Agreement's commitments were non-binding and many states responded to the notification of withdrawal by putting in place their own GHG commitments, notwithstanding the withdrawal.
Efforts to curb GHG emissions in the U.S. are led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the "EPA") GHG regulations and similar programs of certain states. To the extent that our operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations and/or state GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the CAA’s requirements for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. Any further regulation, at state or federal level, may increase our operational costs, such as costs to purchase energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with GHG emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes).
We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to U.S. federal and state requirements, Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate immediate significant cost increases as a result of these programs. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 
Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other extreme climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets, operations and insurance costs. For example, our operations in low lying areas may be at increased risk due to flooding, rising sea levels or disruption of operations from more frequent and severe weather events and operations near forested areas may be at risk of wild fires.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 4,000 associates in our operations around the world. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
We place considerable value on the involvement of our associates and ensure that we keep them informed on matters affecting them, the overall organization as well as on the performance of the Company. 
We conduct formal and informal meetings with associates, and maintain a Company intranet website with key information and other matters of interest.

We are committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion on the basis of competence and ability without discrimination of any kind. Management actively pursues both the employment of disabled persons whenever a suitable vacancy arises and the continued employment and retraining of associates who become disabled while employed by the Company.
