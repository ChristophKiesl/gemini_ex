COMPANY OVERVIEW
 

Corporate Overview
 
Life On Earth, Inc. is a brand accelerator and incubator and is focused on building and scaling concepts in the natural consumer products category. Our mission is to bring our strategic focus and long-term forward-looking vision to consumers in the health, wellness and lifestyle spaces through superior branding, product quality, and direct to consumer and retail experience within the CPG industry.
 
On November 11, 2019, the Board of Directors and a majority of the voting power approved a resolution to effectuate a 5:1 Reverse Stock Split. and an increase in authorized Shares of Common Stock from One Hundred million (100,000,000) to Two Hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, $0.001 par value. The Company received approval from FINRA on March 25, 2020 and, on that date, the reverse stock split became effective. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split.
 
Our management team has over 50 years of combined experience in the food and beverage industry. In July 2016, we acquired Energy Source Distributors (“ESD”) to establish a presence on the West Coast in an all cash purchase. Since then, we have also acquired the Victoria’s Kitchen brand, the Just Chill brand and The Giant Beverage Company, Inc. (“Giant”). During fiscal 2019, we needed to prioritize our available resources and focus on growing the brands in our portfolio. As a result of this reprioritization, on May 7, 2019, the Company , Giant, and Frank Iemmiti and Anthony Iemmiti (“Frank and Anthony Iemmiti”) entered into a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that resolved all existing disputes between the two parties and sold the ownership of Giant to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. On July 4, 2019, the Company and Frank and Anthony Iemmiti executed an amended Dispute Resolution and Resale Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company deposited $50,000 into an attorney’s trust account and Frank and Anthony Iemmiti had a continuing obligation to provide the Company with all financial information of Giant that the Company needed to complete its SEC reporting requirements. Having filed of all SEC documents this money was released to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. In addition, the Company paid to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti the additional stated consideration in the Settlement Agreement, specifically 391,988 shares of common stock This agreement released all current and future causes of actions and claims against the Company. At the closing, the Company sold Giant to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti in exchange for their transfer to the Company of 291,000 common shares previously held by Frank and Anthony Iemmiti.
 
During 2020, the Company discontinued the wholesale beverage distribution operations in Northern California and the Company announced its intention to expand its business as a Consumer-Packaged Goods (“CPG”) Company. The Company is undergoing this offering to raise capital in order to acquire assets that would bring immediate accretive revenues and cash flow to the Company. The Company also stated that the assets it is seeking need to meet certain criteria of having tangible assets values that can be obtained through the proceeds of offering.
 

Life On Earth, Inc. was incorporated in April 2013.
 
In October 2013, we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. (“Gran Nevada”), an entity related through common management and ownership. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada’s beverages in the United States with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada’s distributors. The agreement was for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five-year terms unless terminated. We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014. This agreement was renewed for an additional 5 years as per the agreement. During the years ended 2020 and 2019, the Company sold $0 and $73,592 respectively. These products were produced by a third party copacker and were not purchased from Gran Nevada. The decrease in sales from 2019 to 2020 was related to limited production capacity for the Gran Nevada Horchata that the company was producing. The availability of 3rd party copackers that can produce an Horchata are limited and it directly impacted the sales. As there is currently no co-packing available for this product the Company does not know if they will be able to produce this product again in the future.

In July 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (“ESD”) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The acquisition of ESD in July 2016 allowed the Company to expand distribution on the West Coast. In June 2019, the Company further decided to discontinue the wholesale beverage distribution operations in Northern California and, on November 4, 2019, ESD filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
 
In October 2017, the Company acquired Victoria’s Kitchen, LLC (“VK”). VK is a specialty beverage company that makes exceptional European-inspired drinks. VK’s beverages are natural and all the beverages are Gluten-Free, GMO-Free, Dairy-Free, Vegan and contain no artificial ingredients or preservatives.
 
On April 30, 2018, the Company acquired The Giant Beverage Company Inc. (“Giant” or “GBC”). Giant is a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) business that covers the five boroughs of New York City under an eight-route distribution system. GBC serviced over 600 accounts in the five boroughs. Giant services mainly independent retailers but was expanding to service authorized chain accounts.
 
On May 7, 2019, Life On Earth, Inc., GBC, and Frank Iemmiti and Anthony Iemmiti (“Frank and Anthony Iemmiti”) entered into a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that will resolve all existing disputes between the two parties and will also result in the sale of the ownership of Giant back to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company deposited $50,000 into an Attorney’s Trust Account. Frank and Anthony Iemmiti have a continuing obligation to provide the Company with all financial information of Giant (the “Giant Financial Information”) that the Company needs to complete its SEC reporting requirements. On July 4, 2019 the Company and Frank and Anthony Iemmiti executed a Dispute Resolution and Resale agreement that at the closing the Company authorized the release of the $50,000 to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti. Also, at closing, the Company also paid Frank and Anthony Iemmiti the agreed upon consideration of $62,718 of the Company shares at $0.80 per share. Lastly at the closing, with an effective date of March 2, 2019 the Company sold GBC to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti for 291,000 shares of the Company stock that they owned. The sale of the Giant Beverage Company to Frank and Anthony Iemmiti became effective March 1, 2019.
 
On June 21, 2019, LFER made the determination to shut down and discontinue ESD’s operations and further focus on the brand portfolio. Effective November 4, 2019, ESD filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. On December 11, 2019, the Company received a final decree from the United States Bankruptcy Court ruling that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate for ESD had been fully administered. The results of ESD are included herein as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
 

Sales and Distribution 
 
The Company currently markets and sells mainstream functional beverage products through 3rd party Direct Store Delivery (DSD) platforms as well as through other distributors including KeHe Distributors, LLC (“KeHe”) and United Natural Foods, Incorporated “UNFI”. KeHe has a distribution network in more than 30,000 stores across North America. UNFI is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.
 
The Company also sells it Victoria’s Kitchen brands and Just Chill brands direct to consumers via Amazon online. The Company is also actively seeking additional brands for its portfolio that are primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, natural nonalcoholic functional beverages that are targeted towards the Company’s active lifestyle consumers. The Company recently announced that it would increase or expand its product lines, under its current brands or under new brands, to include CBD. The Company seeks to reach new consumers in a more direct to consumer business model instead of using the traditional channels such other wholesalers and retailers use.

Production and Distribution
 
We do not directly manufacture our products because we outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). After the product is manufactured, the finished products are stored in third-party warehouses. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. As we are using third party co-packers and do not have minimum production contracts in place, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We continually review our contract packing needs in light of regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs. These co-packers are located in different geographic locations throughout the United States and we currently use multiple co-packers. The material terms of these relationships are typically negotiated annually and include pricing, quality standards, delivery times and conditions, purchase orders, and payment terms. Payment terms are typically net 30, meaning that the total invoiced amount is expected to be paid in full within 30 days from the date the products or services are provided. We believe that we have sufficient options for each of our raw and packaging material needs, as well as our third-party distribution needs and also have long-term relationships with each of our suppliers and distributors, resulting in consistency in quality and supply. We also believe that we have sufficient breadth of retail relationships with distribution in both large and small retailers and independents and across multiple channels (mass, club, pharmacies, convenience, and small and large format retailers) throughout the United States.
 
The contractual arrangements with all third parties, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are typical of the beverage industry with standard terms. We have no long-term obligations with any of the third parties nor do any of them have long-term obligations with us. The third-party supplier, manufacturing and distribution agreements were entered into in the normal course of business within the guidelines of industry practices and are not deemed material and definite.
 
Competition

We are a Consumer-Packaged Goods (“CPG”) company. What sets us apart in the industry, is our consolidated corporate structure that handles all aspects of sales, marketing and proprietary distribution from a centralized location. Our platform is built for accelerating emerging growth brands in the United States by leveraging sales, supply chain, and distribution relationships. We have identified ways to build out distribution channels that are more flexible and responsive to today’s needs.
 
We believe that by sharing resources and capabilities in novel ways with new products in new situations, we can take advantage of profit-making opportunities that individual companies could not exploit alone.
 
The CPG industry and the direct selling industries are multi-billion-dollar industries which are highly competitive. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share. The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase, and no assurance can be provided that we can sustain our market position or expand our business. Many of our current CPG competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than we have. However, if we develop a diverse product line and obtain adequate financing, we can compete effectively in the industry. We face intense competition from very large, international corporations and from local and national companies. In addition, we face competition from well-known companies that have large market share. The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase. Many of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and have more name recognition than we have.
 
Government Regulation
 
Packaged consumable and digestible products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet food labeling requirements. The Company’s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.

Research and Development Activities
 
Our research and development efforts were focused on two primary paths. The first is to continually review our existing formulas and production processes and structure to evaluate opportunities for cost of goods sold improvements, without degrading the quality or fundamentally changing the consumer appeal taste profile of our existing products. The second major research and development efforts in the past were in the development of fundamentally new and differentiated products, based on consumer insights and trends and competitive intensity in those segments.
Employees
 
The Company currently has three full-time employees, as follows: a CEO, COO, and President.
 
Certain positions are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. The Company also outsources its logistics to third parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.
Going Concern Qualification

Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $2,325,907 and $8,007,035 for the years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company incurred a net loss from inception of approximately $17,200,000, has limited revenues, and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company’s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities and the Company’s ability to raise additional capital to fund operations. At May 31, 2020, we had cash on hand of $3,831. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 Intellectual Property Protection
 The Company has secured a registered trademark for its name and logo. The Company also has trademarks registered for the Victoria’s Kitchen and Just Chill brands.
