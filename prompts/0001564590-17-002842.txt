Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative platform technologies, we are able to target a broad range of diseases and disorders through distinct RNA-targeted mechanisms of action. 
        DMD Focus
 We are primarily focused on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping drug candidates targeting DMD. DMD is a rare genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. Females are rarely affected by the disorder. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary:
  
• | muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | respiratory and/or cardiac failure before the age of 30, to which they typically succumb.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 EXONDYS 51 is the first disease-modifying therapy to receive accelerated approval for DMD in the U.S. The yearly cost of care for individuals with DMD is high and increases with disease progression. We believe that DMD represents a significant market opportunity.
        U.S. Commercialization 
 Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51® (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. The accelerated approval of EXONDYS 51 is based on the surrogate endpoint of an increase of dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in some EXONDYS 51-treated patients. The FDA has concluded that the data we submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. A clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51, including improved motor function, has not been established. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon completing various post-marketing requirements and commitments to confirm the clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51. Our FDA post marketing requirements and commitments include several studies for eteplirsen and SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, our product candidates designed to skip exons 45 and 53, respectively. 
 In addition to successfully completing our FDA post-marketing requirements and commitments, we are focused on executing our various strategic initiatives designed to drive commercial success of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. We believe that the key priorities for a successful commercial launch include: 
  
• | working with physicians to identify patients and to initiate the process of securing prescriptions by providing education on the importance of genetic testing and knowing / understanding DMD mutations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining an active dialogue and working with payors to provide broad reimbursement and coverage for EXONDYS 51;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifying and appropriately addressing procedural barriers patients face in obtaining therapy to shorten timeframe to treatment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring all DMD patients have genetic tests and are appropriately identified for exon amenability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our commercial initiatives are designed to support these priorities. We are pursuing broad coverage of EXONDYS 51. The payor environment can be very challenging in the orphan drug space. As of the date of this report, the majority of covered lives are pending policy decisions and are currently reviewed case-by-case or approved with restrictions. We continue to have discussions with payors who have denied coverage or have policy decisions limiting coverage of EXONDYS 51. 
        Ex-U.S. Efforts
 
We are also pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. On December 19, 2016, we announced that the EMA validated our previously submitted Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for eteplirsen to treat DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. We are seeking conditional approval of eteplirsen in the EU through the centralized procedure. The review of an MAA generally takes approximately 12-15 months. The review time can vary as it is dependent on the “clock stop” period which is generally between 3 to 6 months to provide responses to questions from the EMA throughout the review process. During the review, we plan to initiate key activities in support of the potential launch of eteplirsen in the EU, such as building out our commercial infrastructure and scaling-up manufacturing. We believe Europe presents a large opportunity for us since there are more DMD patients in Europe than in the U.S. As of the date of this report, EXONDYS 51 has not been approved for sale or marketing by any regulatory agency or authority outside of the U.S. We are also working towards establishing early access programs for eteplirsen in various ex-U.S. jurisdictions. For commercialization activities in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., we may choose to conduct these activities ourselves or may enter into arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the marketing and sale of our products either globally or on a country-by-country basis.

Our Next Generation Exon Skipping Technology
 EXONDYS 51 is our first PMO-based technology to be granted accelerated approval by the FDA. The reminder of our product candidates currently in the clinic are also PMO-based. We are currently focused on rapidly advancing our next generation chemistry for DMD and other applications – a cell penetrating peptide conjugated PMO referred to as PPMO. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated enhanced efficacy as compared to PMO by improving delivery and dystrophin production in vivo, and showing a favorable tolerability in non-human primates. Based on these results, we believe our PPMO chemistry has the potential for a more durable response, which may support less frequent dosing and can potentially be tailored to target any organ. Our current plans are to open file an investigation new drug (“IND”) application in 2017 for PPMO toxicology studies and DMD exon 51.
Pipeline: A Comprehensive Approach to DMD
 
In addition to EXONDYS 51, our DMD pipeline includes other product candidates, which are at various stages of development. The chart below summarizes the status of our more advanced programs as of the date of this report, including those with our strategic partners, reflecting our efforts to become the global leader in DMD RNA-targeted precision medicine while also developing a pipeline with a comprehensive treatment approach to DMD:

       Collaborations with Multiple Treatment Approaches to DMD
 
In addition to advancing our exon-skipping product candidates for DMD, we are working with several strategic partners under various agreements to research and develop multiple treatment approaches to DMD. Included in these strategic partners are (i) Summit (Oxford) Ltd. (“Summit”) with whom we are collaborating under an exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement that grants us rights to Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline in Europe, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States and an option to acquire rights in Latin America and (ii) Nationwide Children’s Hospital with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of their microdystrophin gene therapy program under a research and exclusive option agreement and their Galgt2 gene therapy program under an exclusive license agreement. 

Objectives and Business Strategy
  We believe that our proprietary RNA-targeted technologies platform can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our RNA-targeted technologies platform, organizational capabilities and resources to become a leading developer and marketer of RNA-targeted therapeutics, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to engage in the following activities:

• | executing on our strategic initiatives designed to achieve a successful commercialization of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding the global footprint of eteplirsen by pursuing regulatory approval or establishing early access programs in jurisdictions where regulatory approval has not yet been obtained;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advancing the development of our follow-on exon-skipping drug candidates targeting DMD and further exploring potential funding, collaborations and other opportunities to support such development;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advancing the research and development of our RNA-targeted technologies platform, including our next generation chemistry, PPMO, and identifying product candidates to target additional therapeutic areas at our company or through potential strategic opportunities including potentially entering into partnership, licensing and/or collaboration arrangements with industry partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to expand our portfolio therapeutic approaches targeting DMD through strategic partnerships, collaborations and other potential opportunities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring we have the appropriate capitalization to fund our business objectives and strategies, including by raising additional capital through licensing, collaborations and offerings of Company equity and / or debt.

 Lead Development Program: Pipeline of Exon-Skipping PMO-Based Product Candidates for DMD
 Proprietary Platform Technologies
 PMO. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO-based therapeutics have been safely dosed in over 400 patients. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. When targeted to messenger RNA (“mRNA”), PMO-based compounds down-regulate protein translation by steric blockade. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies of siRNAs and DNA gapmers, and PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from these other RNA-targeted technologies.
 PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. This mechanism can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of 
 -7-

novel proteins. Thus, PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. 
 The safety of therapeutic agents is paramount. We believe that our PMO-based compounds significantly reduce the potential for off-target effects specifically because of their demonstrated inactivity with key molecular mechanisms that are known to be toxicologically active when stimulated. Additionally, consistent with our research and development to date, we believe that PMO-based compounds do not exhibit coagulation and immune stimulatory effects, do not stimulate toll-like receptors (“TLRs”) or receptors of the RIG-I-like receptor family, and do not sequester metal ions away from the catalytic centers of polymerases.
 In addition to our original PMO technology, we have also developed three new PMO-based chemistry platforms. We believe that the novel characteristics intrinsic to these new platforms will allow for the development of drug candidates with favorable safety and efficacy characteristics.
 PPMO. The first of these novel chemistries is based on cell-penetrating PPMOs. This technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced cellular delivery into the cytosol and the nucleus. Based on our pre-clinical research, we believe our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrates enhanced efficacy as compared to PMO and has the potential to provide improved delivery and dystrophin production in vivo, favorable tolerability in non-human primates, and a more durable response, which may support less frequent dosing and can potentially be tailored to target any organ. We plan on beginning IND-enabling Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) toxicology studies during early 2017 and we are targeting opening an IND before year-end in 2017 for DMD exon 51. 
 PMOplus®. The second of these chemistries, PMOplus®, features the selective introduction of positive charges to the PMO backbone. We believe that PMOplus® has potentially broad therapeutic applications, especially for anti-viral therapeutics.
 PMO-X®. The third of these chemistries, PMO-X®, incorporates novel and proprietary chemical modifications to the PMO backbone linkages. We believe PMO-X® may provide enhanced in vivo potency and efficacy, as well as greater flexibility in the modulation of selective tissue targeting and cellular delivery.
 We believe that our PMO-based technology platforms can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our PMO-based technology platforms, organizational capabilities, and resources to become a leading developer and marketer of a diversified portfolio of PMO-based therapeutics, especially for the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases.

EXONDYS 51. EXONDYS 51® (eteplirsen) Injection, our first commercial product, approved by the U.S. FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Approximately 13% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In connection with fulfilling our FDA post-marketing requirements and commitments, we are in the process of planning several studies for eteplirsen and product candidates targeting skipping of exon 53 and/or exon 45. In addition, we are conducting an open label extension of our Phase 2b study for which patients can transition to commercial drug after certain criteria are met (Study 4658-us-202), an open label study on ambulatory patients with a concurrent untreated control arm (Study 4658-301/PROMOVI), a study evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in participants with advanced stage DMD (Study 4658-204) and a study evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in participants with early stage DMD (Study 4658-203), each of which will allow for patients to transition to commercial drug after meeting certain criteria. We are also planning two additional Phase 1 studies. In connection with our MAA for eteplirsen, which received EMA validation, and our efforts to obtain approval of eteplirsen in the EU, we are in the planning stages of an intravenous study on participants between the ages of six months and four years in connection with our Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) in the EU.
 Exon 53. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), our phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, respectively. SRP-4053, an exon 53-skipping product candidate that we selected for development through the SKIP-NMD consortium, is currently in the clinic in EU as part of a Phase 1/2 study. Part I has been completed and Part II, an open label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). The SKIP-NMD Consortium, which supported certain clinical proof of concept studies and IND-enabling activities for an exon 53-skipping therapeutic using our PMO technology, received an EU Health Innovation-1 2012 collaborative research grant (grant agreement No. 305370) to support the initial development of SRP-4053. SRP-4053 will potentially address one of the most prevalent sets of mutations in DMD that are amenable to exon-skipping.
 Exon 45. We are enrolling and dosing patients amenable to exon 45 skipping in ESSENCE, our placebo controlled study for eteplirsen further described above. SRP-4045, an exon 45-skipping product candidate that we selected for development in collaboration with Children’s National Medical Center (“CNMC”) in Washington, D.C. and the Carolinas Medical Center (“CMC”) in Charlotte, N.C. This collaboration was funded primarily through two grants, one from Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program to CNMC and the other from the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to the CMC. Pursuant to an ongoing Sarepta-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical study studying SRP-4045 (Study 4045-101), we have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and are currently conducting the open-label portion of the study (Phase 2). SRP-4045 will potentially address one of the most prevalent sets of mutations in DMD that are amenable to exon-skipping. 
 Our DMD pipeline includes additional product candidates, which are at various stages of development. Our DMD program is part of our larger pan-exon strategy for the development of drug candidates to address the most prevalent exon mutations in the DMD population. Because the majority of DMD patients have exon mutations that cluster together, a small number of exon-skipping therapies will potentially be disease-modifying for a relatively large percentage of DMD patients. Approximately 75-80% of the total DMD population is potentially treatable with exon-skipping therapeutics.
 Discovery and Research Programs
 Rare Diseases. We are researching the application of our proprietary PMO-based technologies in a number of rare diseases. 
 Anti-Bacterials. The rapid emergence of broad antibiotic resistance has underscored the urgent need for new paradigms in antimicrobial development. Our anti-bacterial program is focused on drug-resistant bacteria identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) as urgent or serious threats to the U.S. healthcare system. Early research findings demonstrate that targeted PPMOs can successfully inhibit translation of essential structural genes such as acyl carrier protein (“acpP”), resistance proteins such as the NDM-1 metallo-b-lactamase, or those responsible for biofilm formation, which is critical for Burkholderia cepacia complex to evade host immune responses or systemic antibiotics such as cysteine protease cepI., which is responsible for biofilm expression. Additionally, though acpP alone can be bactericidal at clinically achievable concentration, data demonstrates that co-administration of the PPMOs targeting NDM-1 can restore antibiotic activity of drugs like meropenem or imipenem to clinically achievable levels in high-level multidrug resistant Acinetobacter, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Burkholderia spp in both bench top and mouse models. Finally, we have also seen that PPMOs targeting structural genes such as acpP or quorum sensing genes such as cepI (responsible for biofilm expression) can penetrate and disrupt established biofilm; furthermore, the PPMOs targeting acpP can successfully kill the established bacterial colonies in Burkholderia cepacia models. We believe the results of this early research could have broad commercial applicability. We are exploring IND enabling studies now, and are open to partnership opportunities in the development of our anti-bacterial program.

Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution
 We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product and product candidates to support clinical development as well as commercialization. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of our product and certain of our product candidates and their components. We currently do not have any of our own internal manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.
 For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (“CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the APIs and finished goods for our product candidates. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. Specially, for our commercial DMD program, we have commenced work with our existing manufacturers to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale.
 While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our product, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill all of these requirements, and are capable of continuing to expand capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks.  
 Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements, and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
 EXONDYS 51 is distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes EXONDYS 51 to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics.
 Material Agreements
 We believe that our RNA-targeted technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements.
Summit (Oxford) Ltd.
 On October 3, 2016, we entered into the exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Summit which grants us the exclusive right to commercialize products in Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline in the E.U., Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States (the “Licensed Territory”).
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we made an up-front payment of $40.0 million to Summit, with the potential for additional payments of up to $192.0 million based on achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for ezutromid. For each of Summit’s future generation small molecule utrophin modulators, we may be required to make up to $290.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. Additionally, on a product-by-product basis, we may be required to make up to $330.0 million in sales milestone payments.
 The Collaboration Agreement also grants us an option to expand the Licensed Territory. If we exercise this option, then we will be liable for a one-time $10.0 million option fee as well as up to $7.0 million in regulatory milestone payments. For each of Summit’s lead product candidate, ezutromid, for the treatment of DMD, and its second generation and future generation small molecule utrophin modulators (collectively, the “Licensed Product”), we may be liable for up to $82.5 million in sales milestone payments.
 Additionally, we may be required to make tiered royalty payments ranging from a low to high teens percentage of net sales on a product-by-product basis in the Licensed Territory.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Summit will be solely responsible for all research and development costs for the Licensed Products until December 31, 2017. Thereafter, Summit will be responsible for 55.0% of the budgeted research and development costs related to the Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory, and we will be responsible for 45.0% of such costs. Any costs in excess of 110.0% of the budgeted amount will be borne by the party that incurred such costs. Summit is also obligated to spend a specified minimum amount on the research and development of certain Licensed Products prior to the end of 2019.
 Manufacture and Supply of Licensed Products
 -10-

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Summit has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply to us active pharmaceutical ingredient, finished drug product and placebo for us to conduct research, development and commercialization activities for the Licensed Products. We will also have the right to establish back up and second source suppliers under certain circumstances.
Commercialization
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we will be solely responsible for all commercialization activities and associated costs relating to the Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Licensed Products in specified countries within the Licensed Territory and, if the exclusive option to expand the Licensed Territory to include specified countries in South and Central America (the “Option Territory”) is exercised, to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Licensed Products in certain specified countries within the Option Territory.
University of Western Australia
 
In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with University of Western Australia (“UWA”) under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated (the “Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement”). The Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. EXONDYS 51, SRP-4045 and SRP-4053 fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51 and up to five additional product candidates. As of the date of this report, a portion of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments has been made. We may also be obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we may be required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. However, we have the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Under this option, prior to the First Amendment (defined below), we could be required to make a one-time royalty payment of $30.0 million to UWA. 
 In June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with UWA. Under the First Amendment, we were obligated to make an up-front payment of $7.0 million to UWA upon execution of the First Amendment. Under the terms of the First Amendment, UWA has waived rights to certain royalties and amended the timing of certain other royalty payments under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, including lowering the one-time royalty payment that is due by us upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front, we would still be obligated to make up to $20.0 million in payments to UWA upon achievement of certain sales milestones. 
 Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by our agreement with UWA expires is November 2030 (not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available), however, patents granting from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date.
 Strategic Alliances
 In connection with our multi-front battle against DMD, we entered into a number of partnering opportunities. We believe these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent the most comprehensive approach to treating DMD.   
     Nationwide Children’s Hospital
 In January 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital for their Galgt2 gene therapy program. This program explores the potential surrogate gene therapy approach to DMD. Under this approach, the gene therapy looks to induce genes that make proteins that can perform a similar function as dystrophin, with the goal of producing a muscle cell that can function normally even when dystrophin is absent. This approach has the potential to be used broadly in several muscular dystrophies, regardless of their mutation. 
 In addition, in December 2016, we entered into a research and option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital on their microdystrophin gene therapy program. The initial trial, which is expected to go into Phase 1/2a trial in late 2017, will be conducted at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy has committed $2.2 million to the trial, with support from additional Duchenne foundations and families. We have committed to the trial through a research agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and we have an exclusive option to exclusively license the program.
      Catabasis
 -11-

In September 2016, we entered into a joint research collaboration with Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Catabasis”) to explore a combination drug treatment approach for DMD. We will contribute our expertise to study an exon skipping treatment while Catabasis will contribute its oral NF-kB inhibition treatment for this combination study for DMD. The objective of the joint research is to study the safety and efficacy of combining these two treatment strategies using a mouse model of DMD, including evaluating the potential for additional or synergistic benefits.
Charley’s Fund Agreement
 In October 2007, Charley’s Fund, Inc. (“Charley’s Fund”), a nonprofit organization that funds drug development and discovery initiatives specific to DMD, awarded us a research grant of approximately $2.5 million and, in May 2009, the grant authorization was increased to a total of $5.0 million. Pursuant to the related sponsored research agreement, the grant was provided to support the development of product candidates related to exon 50 skipping using our proprietary exon-skipping technologies. As of December 31, 2016, Charley’s Fund had made payments of approximately $3.4 million to us. Revenue associated with this research and development arrangement is recognized based on the proportional performance method. To date, we have recognized approximately $0.1 million as revenue. We have deferred $3.3 million of previous receipts, which are anticipated to be recognized as revenue upon resolution of outstanding performance obligations.
 Previously, we noted unexpected toxicology findings in the kidney as part of our series of preclinical studies for AVI-5038, our PMO-based candidate designed for the treatment of individuals with DMD who have an error in the gene coding for dystrophin that can be treated by skipping exon 50. We have conducted additional preclinical studies and have not alleviated the toxicity problem. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Charley’s Fund, the receipt of additional funds is tied to the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones. Because of the toxicity issues with AVI-5038, satisfaction of the additional milestones under the agreement is unlikely and we do not expect to receive any additional funds from Charley’s Fund.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as regulatory exclusivity and contractual protections.
 Our patents and patent applications are directed to our product candidates as well as to our PMO-based technologies platform. We seek patent protection for certain of our product candidates and proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate.
 Our product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and use patents and patent applications. Currently, our exon skipping clinical product candidates for DMD include EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen), SRP-4045 and SRP-4053.
 We own patents and have exclusively licensed patents from UWA that provide primary patent protection for eteplirsen, SRP-4045 and SRP-4053 as follows:

 ******Involved in Opposition proceedings initiated on August 25, 2016.
 In addition to the foregoing patents that protect eteplirsen, SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen as well as our DMD follow-on exon-skipping candidates (e.g., SRP-4045 and SRP-4053), which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of these drug candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2025 and 2036, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. 

 We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus®, PMO-X®). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire between 2024 and 2036, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta®, Sarepta Therapeutics®, PMOplus®, PMO-X® the Sarepta Therapeutics logo, EXONDYS®, and EXONDYS 51®. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, and successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.
 We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including:
  
• | our available resources;
--+-------------------------


• | the number and types of patents already filed or pending;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | the likelihood of success of the product candidate;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the size of the commercial market;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected.
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. In addition, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. For example, we are aware of certain claims that our competitor BioMarin has rights to in the U.S that, if granted, may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties that have rights to these claims to assert that our drug candidates, eteplirsen and/or SRP-4053, infringe on such claims. In 2014, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the USPTO declared various patent interferences between certain patents held by Sarepta under a license from the UWA and patent applications held by BioMarin under license from Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) related to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping therapies designed to treat DMD. Patents held or licensed to Sarepta and included in these interference proceedings are presumed valid by statute for the duration of these proceedings and any appeals. These interferences have not changed our plans to seek regulatory approval for eteplirsen in foreign markets and pursue post-marketing commitments in the U.S., continue with our clinical development plans for eteplirsen and SRP-4053 or continue to commercialize EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.; however, if final resolution of these interferences and related appeals are not in our favor, our current business, development and commercialization plans for eteplirsen and SRP-4053 may be negatively impacted. For details on and risks related to the interferences that the PTAB has declared involving our patents, please read Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our success, competitive position and future revenue, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies, product, and product candidates, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.
 The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. For example, BioMarin has rights to European Patent No. EP 1619249. We opposed this patent in the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (“Opposition Division”), and in November 2011, we announced that, although we succeeded in invalidating some of the patent’s claims, the Opposition Division maintained in amended form certain claims of this patent relating to the treatment of DMD by skipping dystrophin exons 51 and 46. We and BioMarin both appealed this decision in June 2013; however, pending final resolution of this matter, the patent at issue may provide the basis for BioMarin or other parties that have rights to such patent in the relevant European country to assert that our drug candidate, eteplirsen, infringes on such patent upon launching eteplirsen in such relevant European country. The outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted or determined as of the date of this report. If, as part of any appeal before the European Patent Office, we are unsuccessful in invalidating BioMarin’s claims that were maintained by the Opposition Division or if claims previously invalidated by the Opposition Division are restored on appeal, our ability to commercialize both eteplirsen and other therapeutic candidates, such as SRP-4045 and SRP-4053 could be materially impaired.  Moreover, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen could be materially impaired in a European country where BioMarin has a patent related to EP 1619249 while the appeal process remains ongoing before the European Patent Office Board of Appeals. In addition, we are aware of various divisional applications relating to EP 1619249 that are being pursued by BioMarin, which are pending, granted and, in some cases, are proceeding to grant.  One of these divisional applications that has been granted claims exon 45 skipping antisense oligonucleotides (EP 2594641) and another claims exon 53 skipping antisense oligonucleotides (EP 2602322).  We opposed EP 2594641 and EP 2602322 in the Opposition Division on September 29, 2016 and December 1, 2016, respectively.  Should we be unsuccessful in invalidating these patents, or any related patents that grant, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen or our other therapeutic candidates, such as SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, could be materially impaired. 
 In addition to government, court and regulatory patent decisions, changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that we own or have licensed from/to third-parties. Further, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, there is no assurance that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions.
 Government Regulation
 The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug 
 -14-

applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
 U.S. Drug Approval Process
 To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, first and foremost, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an NDA for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including placebo-controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the NDA and also potentially the nonclinical manufacturing site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical studies. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations:
  
• | Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase 1 studies usually involve less
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -15-

 
than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers unless the drug is toxic (e.g., cytotoxics) in which case they are tested in patients.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of an NDA. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, for orphan drug indications due to their lower prevalence, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated populations in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to data from natural history studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. Phase 4 trials are clinical studies conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase 4 trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for “full” approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, in the form of an NDA, including payment of a user fee unless the submission is for an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted NDAs for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some case, the FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the NDA, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the NDA sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA. 
 A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication and begin reviewing sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007 and both AVI-7288 and AVI-7537 were granted fast track status in September 2012.
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA 
 -16-

reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. 
 Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. 
 Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete NDA is accepted for filing.
 We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. 
 Holders of an approved NDA are required to:
  
• | report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the U.S.
 In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical entity for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. In the U.S., we have been granted an orphan drug designation for AVI-7288 for prophylaxis following documented or suspected exposure to Marburg virus, AVI-7537 for prophylaxis for patients following documented or suspected exposure to Ebola virus and AVI-5038 for the treatment of DMD in patients with a deletion, duplication or frame shift mutation correctable by skipping of exon 50 of the dystrophin gene to allow restoration of the reading frame (including mutations within exons 51, 51-53, or 51-55) in the U.S. The FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity to EXONDYS 51 through September 19, 2023, which is seven years from its approval date, September19, 2016, for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping.
 -17-

Distinct from orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of an NDA, if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of such product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and new chemical entity exclusivity. 
 Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 We are pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. On December 19, 2016, we announced that the EMA validated for centralized assessment our previously submitted MAA for eteplirsen to treat DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products.  Irrespective of whether it is an FDA approved drug or an investigational drug, approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries are required before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC concerning conduct of clinical trials in the EU and the Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the principles and guidelines on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials that has been implemented through national legislation in the member states in the EU. Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation has come into force, but will come into application in all EU Member States in October 2018 without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new regulation provides an overhaul of the system to ensure greater consistency in the approval of clinical trials with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State. The reporting Member State will consult and coordinate with all other Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted (concerned Member States). If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through a central EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in those Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials.
 In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit an MAA to either the national Competent Authorities or the EMA for the Centralized authorization procedures, using the ICH Common Technical Document (“CTD”). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization. This includes the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Submission of data in compliance with an agreed PIP is essential for the validation or acceptance of an MAA for review. Medicinal products are authorized in the EU through one of several different procedures, either by the national competent authorities of the EU Member States (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures), or through the centralized authorization procedure administered by the EMA. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products, for which there is a single application, a single evaluation and a single approval allowing direct access to the single market of the EU. Approval via the Centralized Procedure is a two-step process whereby the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) first adopts an “Opinion” recommending grant of a marketing authorization following a review of the submitted data to inform an assessment of benefit/risk. The adopted Opinion can be positive or negative.  A positive CHMP opinion is followed by European Commission (“EC”) binding decision to grant a marketing authorization. The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). These countries collectively belong to the European Economic Area. The timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application leading to the CHMP opinion is 210 days (discounting procedural clock-stops) from receipt of a valid application for marketing authorization. This time period to complete the scientific review is generally longer than the 210 days as “clock stops” are required to respond to additional written or oral information requested by the EMA. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EU Commission has 67 days to issue the EC Decision (i.e. the marketing authorization).
 Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines the scope and eligibility of applications for evaluation under the centralized procedure through which medicinal products must ("mandatory scope") or may ("optional scope" or "Generic/Hybrid") be authorized by the Community. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including medicinal products 
 -18-

derived from biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of certain diseases including treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is optional for new active substances and products that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, where approval would be in the interest of public health. Our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure.
 Accelerated evaluation may be granted in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case by case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. During an accelerated assessment, the opinion of the CHMP is given, in principle, within 150 days. The EU Commission Decision is then issued according to the timetable described above.
 Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full stand-alone marketing authorization application consisting of pharmaceutical and preclinical testing results and clinical trial data (as opposed to an application for a generic marketing authorization that relies on the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, reference medicinal product) are treated as reference medicinal products and accordingly entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full 10-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. This period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies or as the result of significant preclinical or clinical studies. 
 In the EU, orphan medicinal product designation is considered by the EMA for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU or if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. Medicinal products developed for treating serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. As such, they may also be eligible for an EU orphan drug designation.  Benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the 10-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of 12 years on the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen and AVI-5038 in the EU.
 Similarly to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. 
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. 
 The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States. This Directive imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer patient data, including sensitive health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards imposition of an obligation of public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to the processing of health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. The Data Protection Directive also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom 
 -19-

the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU Member States that are not considered by the EU to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU Guidance developed at both EU level and at national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
 In December 2015, a proposal for an EU General Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and will be applicable in May 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU General Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to any personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules.
 The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Expanded / Early Access 
 In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, providing the product either free of charge on a named patient basis, and providing the product on a compassionate use basis or can be charged at a price agreed by the National Agencies. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country.
Other Regulatory Requirements
 In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and brining suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The Healthcare Reform Act clarifies the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, providing that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. 
 -20-

In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act revised the FCA to provide that a claim arising from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws. 
 Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $10,781 to $21,563 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
 Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). The Healthcare Reform Act requires manufacturers to submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Recent scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices by certain companies may lead to changes in laws that currently allow substantial flexibility in pricing decisions by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Such changes could occur at the federal level or state level and may be adopted by statute, rule, or sub-regulatory policies. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. We have an ongoing dialogue with payors with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for EXONDYS 51. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for EXONDYS 51 have varied on their approach, including policies that allow broad coverage per the EXONDYS 51 prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage, to policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors are reviewing coverage on a case-by-case basis or approving with restrictions. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the price that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse on behalf of patients and physicians for the cost of EXONDYS 51. 
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. 
 
Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our EXONDYS 51 varies from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans manage access to FDA approved products’ coverage partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Exclusion from policies can directly reduce product usage in the payor’s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payor plans, as well.
 Medicaid. Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connections with favorable positioning on formularies. 
 Medicare. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are 
 -21-

also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. 
 Federal Purchasers. Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation.
PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program. To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. 
 ACA. The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act are expected under the new Trump administration and Congress. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Affordable Care Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
 General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S.
 
In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around DMD.
 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on:

• | our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing and scope of regulatory approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the speed at which we develop product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -22-

 
• | obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DMD Program Competition. Currently, other than EXONDYS 51, no disease-modifying product in the U.S. has been approved for the treatment of DMD and no such product is commercially available outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Other companies, however, have product candidates or other interests in development for the treatment of DMD.  
 PTC Therapeutics (“PTC”) has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, which targets nonsense mutations in development. The European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ataluren for the treatment of a subset of DMD patients in August 2014. In January 2016, PTC announced the completion of its rolling submission of an NDA for ataluren to the FDA and submission of its Phase 3 Ataluren Confirmatory Trial (“ACT”) DMD clinical trial result to the EMA. Ataluren uses a distinct scientific approach that addresses a different genotype of DMD patients compared to eteplirsen. Therefore, we do not believe ataluren is appropriate for the treatment of DMD patients that are amenable to exon-skipping therapy.
 BioMarin has an exon 51-skipping product candidate, drisapersen. An NDA for drisapersen was filed by the FDA and an MAA was submitted to the EMA in June 2015. In January 2016, the FDA issued a complete response letter and declined the approval for drisapersen for the treatment of DMD. BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of DMD.  BioMarin further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD.
 Wave Life Sciences (“Wave”) announced the selection of its stereopure exon-skipping candidate, WVE-210201, to target deletions of Exon 51.  WVE-210201 is said to be entering the clinic in the second half of 2017.
 Nippon Shinyaku has reported early clinical development data for its exon 53 skipping candidate, NS-065, and the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 study, which is enrolling in the U.S.  It has also reported a phase 1/2 study in Japan. NS-065 has been reported to have received an orphan drug designation in the U.S. and was granted Fast Track by FDA.
 Daiichi Sankyo has reported early clinical development in Japan for its exon 45 skipping candidate, DS-5141b.  
 Solid Biosciences, LLC, Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc. and Genethon have reported that they are each in the pre-clinical stages of development of a gene therapy technology for DMD.
 Other companies continue to pursue approval of products for the treatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our DMD pipeline.  Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if further clinical development of these or other exon-skipping compounds is planned.
 Additionally, companies such as Santhera, Summit, Catabasis, Pfizer and Tivorsan have unique product candidates in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our clinical candidates at this time.
 In addition, several companies and institutions have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including but not limited to Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit, Akashi, Catabasis and Oxford University.
 Platform Technology Competition. We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG, Santaris Pharma A/S (now Roche), Nippon Shinyaku, Daiichi Sankyo and Wave.
