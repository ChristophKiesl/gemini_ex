ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

General 
 BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (“BlackRock Capital,” the “Company” or the “Registrant,” which may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”) provides middle-market companies with flexible financing solutions, including senior and junior secured, unsecured and subordinated debt securities and loans, each of which may include an equity component. Our strategy is to provide capital to meet our clients’ current and future needs across this spectrum, creating long-term partnerships with growing middle-market companies. 
 We were incorporated on April 13, 2005, commenced operations with private funding on July 25, 2005, and completed our initial public offering on July 2, 2007. We are an externally-managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which we refer to as the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes we intend to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal 
 2


Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. We are also registered as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which we refer to as the “Advisers Act.” 
 Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through our debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in middle-market companies and target investments that we believe provide an attractive risk-adjusted return. The term “middle-market” refers to companies with enterprise value typically between $100 million and $1.5 billion. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $5 million and $25 million, although the investment sizes may be more or less than the targeted range and the size of our investments may grow with our capital availability. We generally seek to invest in companies that operate in a broad variety of industries and that generate positive cash flow. 
 Although most of our new investments are in senior secured loans to primarily U.S. private middle-market companies, our investment portfolio may include junior secured, unsecured and subordinated loans, common and preferred equity, options and warrants, credit derivatives, high-yield bonds, distressed debt and other structured securities. We may from time to time invest up to 30% of our assets opportunistically in other types of investments, including securities of other public companies and foreign securities. 
 The senior and junior secured loans in which we invest generally have stated terms of three to ten years and the subordinated debt investments we make generally have stated terms of up to ten years, but the expected average life of such senior and junior secured loans and subordinated debt is generally between three and seven years. However, we may invest in securities of any maturity or duration. The debt that we invest in typically is not initially rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than “Baa3” by Moody’s Investors Service, lower than “BBB-” by Fitch Ratings or lower than “BBB-” by Standard & Poor’s). We may invest without limit in debt of any rating, as well as debt that has not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
 Organization of the Advisor
 BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC (“BCIA”, or the “Advisor”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, including but not limited to the Advisor, “BlackRock”), is a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment advisor under the Advisers Act. BlackRock is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.7 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2020. BlackRock has substantial investment and portfolio management experience, which we believe is beneficial to the Company and our stockholders. As part of the BlackRock platform, we continue to seek to enhance the risk-return profile of the Company, strengthen its distribution paying capacity and optimize the valuation for our shareholders.
 Our investment activities are carried out by the Advisor, which is led by James E. Keenan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the BlackRock US Private Capital Group’s Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”). The voting members of the Investment Committee are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman Jr., Howard M. Levkowitz, Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal, and Philip Tseng. 
 Market opportunity 
 We believe that current market conditions present opportunities for investment in middle-market companies with attractive risk-adjusted returns for several reasons, including: 
 Middle-market companies have faced increased difficulty in accessing the capital markets. While many middle-market companies were able to raise funds by raising debt in the capital markets in the past, we believe this approach to financing has become more difficult, as transactions have increased in size to address investors’ demands for greater liquidity in securities such as high yield bonds. In addition, we believe that many senior lenders have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing large, liquid capital markets transactions. 
 There is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support private investments. We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital available to middle-market companies. We expect that private equity firms will be active investors in middle-market companies and that these private equity firms will seek to supplement their equity investments with senior secured and junior loans and equity co-investments from other sources, such as us. 
 Middle-market companies are increasingly seeking private sources for debt and equity capital. We believe that many middle-market companies prefer to execute transactions with private capital providers such as us, rather than execute high-yield bond or equity transactions in the public markets, which may necessitate increased financial and regulatory compliance and reporting obligations. 
 Consolidation among commercial banks has reduced the focus on middle-market business. We believe that many senior lenders have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market companies in favor of lending to large corporate clients, managing capital markets transactions and providing other non-credit services to their customers.

Competitive advantages 
 We believe we possess the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies: 
 The BlackRock Platform: Our investment activities are carried out by the Advisor, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock. BlackRock is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.7 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2020. With employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients worldwide. We believe our affiliation with BlackRock provides us with access to one of the deepest, broadest investment platforms in the financial services industry, with strategies across asset classes and investment styles all backed by our industry leading technology and risk management.  BlackRock’s platform provides our investment professionals with market, company and industry insights that enhances our investment and due diligence processes.
 Acquisition and Integration of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, LLC (“TCP”): In August 2018, BlackRock completed the acquisition of TCP, a leading investment manager focused on middle market performing credit and special situations credit opportunities. We believe that the acquisition of TCP and integration of its operations has benefited the Company through increased deal flow and added industry-specific expertise, along with providing a more holistic financing solution to our borrowers. As part of the integration, Howard M. Levkowitz, Rajneesh Vig, and Philip Tseng, three of TCP’s principals, joined the Investment Committee as voting members who brought vast experience and expertise in direct lending. Following the integration, our combined platform increased  in scale and capabilities. Additionally, we believe that the ability to co-invest with TCP affiliated funds helps to mitigate portfolio risk by increasing issuer and sector diversity. 
 Demonstrated ability to deploy capital consistent with our investment policies. Since our inception, we have invested in excess of $5.2 billion across 233 portfolio companies through December 31, 2020. We have a debt and income producing equity yield at fair value of approximately 8.9% at December 31, 2020. During 2020, we invested approximately $143.5 million of gross assets. 
 Proven transaction sourcing strategy. Since the inception of operations, we have sourced and reviewed more than 5,400 potential investments and have a proven process through which we have invested in excess of $5.2 billion through December 31, 2020. The Advisor identifies potential investments through its dynamic transaction origination efforts. The origination efforts include calling on financial institutions such as investment banks, commercial banks, specialty finance companies and private equity firms; as well as on advisory firms, trade associations and the owners and managers of middle-market companies with whom the investment professionals and investment committee members have relationships. We expect that our ability to leverage these relationships will continue to result in the referral of investment opportunities to us and provide us with a competitive advantage. 
 Highly experienced investment team. Since April 2018, our investment activities have been carried out by our Advisor, which is led by James E. Keenan, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the Investment Committee. The voting members of the Investment Committee are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman Jr., Howard M. Levkowitz, Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal and Philip Tseng. The investment professionals, as well as members of the Investment Committee, have extensive experience in fixed income, public equity and private equity investing, and possess a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills. 
 Our executive officers and directors and the employees of BlackRock and certain of its affiliates, as well as members of the Investment Committee, serve or may serve as investment advisors, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment funds managed by our affiliates. We note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently formed or formed in the future and managed or to be managed in the future by the Advisor or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Advisor or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by the Advisor or its affiliates. However, the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures. In any such case, if the Advisor forms other affiliates in the future, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions. 
 Disciplined investment process with focus on preservation of capital. In making investment decisions, the Advisor employs a disciplined and selective review process that focuses on, among other things, a thorough analysis of the underlying issuer’s business and the performance drivers of that business, as well as an assessment of the legal and economic features of each particular investment.

Cost-effective and high-quality infrastructure. We benefit from the existing infrastructure and administrative capabilities of BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. (the “Administrator”). For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement. 
 Operating and regulatory structure 
 Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by our Board of Directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, the Advisor and our affiliates. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Under our Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor an annual base management fee (the “Base Management Fee”) based on our total assets, as well as an incentive management fee (the “Incentive Fee”) based on our performance. The Current Management Agreement also provides that we will reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Advisor under that agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Advisor to us. 
 While we may borrow funds to make investments, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects. As a BDC and a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Code, for tax purposes, we are dependent on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock. RICs generally must distribute substantially all of their earnings to stockholders in order to achieve pass-through tax treatment, which prevents us from using those earnings to support operations, which may include new investments (including investments into existing portfolio companies). Further, BDCs must maintain an asset coverage ratio (the ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness) of not less than 150% (200% prior to May 2, 2020) in order to incur debt or issue senior securities, meaning generally that for every dollar of debt incurred or senior securities issued, we must have one dollar and fifty cents of assets. Our existing debt arrangements also require that we maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than 15
0% (200% prior to May 2, 2020), among other things.
 Portfolio composition 
 We have built an investment portfolio that includes primarily senior secured debt to U.S. private middle-market companies. Although most of our new investments are in senior debt investments, our investment portfolio may include junior secured, unsecured and subordinated loans, common and preferred equity, options and warrants, credit derivatives, high-yield bonds, distressed debt and other structured securities. Our targeted investment typically ranges between $5 million and $25 million, although the investment sizes may be more or less than the targeted range and may grow with our capital availability. We generally seek to invest in companies that operate in a broad variety of industries and that generate positive cash flows. While our focus is to generate current income through these investments, we also seek capital appreciation. 
 We generally are not permitted to invest in any private company in which any of our affiliates holds an existing investment, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We may, however, co-invest on a concurrent basis with our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds. 
 Exit Strategy. The Advisor seeks to invest in companies that it believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay loans and/or build equity value. With respect to loans and debt securities, the Advisor expects that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments will be a key means by which we exit these investments over time. In addition, the Advisor seeks to invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or another capital market transaction. With respect to our equity investments, the Advisor will look to exit such investments via repurchases by the portfolio company, public offerings and sales pursuant to merger and acquisition transactions.
 Liquidation Value of Assets. The prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing loans in which we invest is an important factor in the Advisor’s credit analysis. The Advisor emphasizes both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases. 
Investment Process
 The Advisor’s investment process is designed to maximize its strategic advantages: a strong brand name as a specialty lender to the middle-market and diverse in-house expertise and skills. The Advisor seeks out opportunities by conducting a rigorous and disciplined investment process that combines the following characteristics:

Deal Sourcing. As a leading middle-market corporate debt investment manager with approximately $15.1 billion in committed capital as of December 31, 2020 (approximately 5% of which consists of the Company’s committed capital), the Advisor is active in new deal financing opportunities in the middle-market segment. However, we believe that the Advisor’s real deal flow advantage comes from the proprietary network of established relationships of its investment professionals and synergies among its professionals and portfolio companies. Members of the Advisor’s Investment Committee for the Company (the “Investment Committee”) have long-term relationships with deal sources including investment bankers, restructuring professionals, bankruptcy attorneys, senior lenders, high yield bond specialists, research analysts, accountants, fund management teams, the Advisor’s advisory board, senior executive advisors, board members of former clients, former colleagues and other operating professionals to facilitate deal flow. The Investment Committee is currently comprised of seven voting members. In total, the Investment Committee consists of approximately 50 members from the Advisor. The number of voting and non-voting members of the Investment Committee is subject to increase or decrease in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All members of the Investment Committee attend investment meetings and are encouraged to participate in discussions. In addition, members of the Investment Committee have relationships with other investors, including insurance companies, bond funds, mezzanine funds, private equity funds, hedge funds and other funds which invest in similar assets. Further, the Advisor regularly calls on both active and recently retired senior executives from the relevant industries to assist with the due diligence of potential investments. Historically, these relationships with retired senior executives have also been a valuable source of transactions and information. The Advisor anticipates that they will continue to provide future opportunities. We believe the Advisor’s strong relationships with its portfolio companies facilitate positive word-of-mouth recommendations to other companies seeking the Advisor’s expertise. The Advisor’s relationships often result in the ability to access investment opportunities earlier than many of its competitors and in some cases on an exclusive basis.
 Due Diligence Process. The foundation of the Advisor’s investment process is intensive investment research and analysis by its experienced staff of investment professionals. The Advisor’s senior professionals have worked together for numerous years and we believe that they have a superior level of credit investing knowledge relative to other credit investors. The Advisor supplements its in-house knowledge with industry experts, including CEO/CFO-level executives, with direct management experience in the industries under consideration. The Advisor prefers these industry experts to consultants because of the practical business advice that comes from having managed businesses. The Advisor rigorously and comprehensively analyzes issuers of securities of interest. The process includes a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer’s business, an evaluation of its management, an analysis of the business strategy and industry trends, and an in-depth examination of the company’s capital structure, financial results and projections. The Advisor’s due diligence process includes:

• | an assessment of the outlook for the industry and general macroeconomic trends;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | discussions with issuer management and other industry executives, including the assessment of management/board strengths and weaknesses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an analysis of the fundamental asset values and the enterprise value of the issuer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the issuer’s key assets, core competencies, competitive advantages, historical and projected financial statements, capitalization, financial flexibility, debt amortization requirements, and tax, environmental, legal and regulatory contingencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the issuer’s existing credit documents, including credit agreements, indentures, intercreditor agreements, and security agreements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of documents governing the issuer, including charter, by-laws, and key contracts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a part of its due diligence process, the Advisor considers sustainability-related factors that can affect the future prospects of the issuer. Since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer better outcomes, the Advisor integrates sustainability considerations into the way it manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies.
 Structuring Originations. As an early non-bank participant in the leveraged loan market, we believe that loan origination is a core competency of the Advisor. Supplementing industry deal teams’ experience and competency, the Advisor has a number of professionals with legal experience, including significant experience in bankruptcy and secured credit. Deal teams work with the Advisor’s in-house legal specialists and outside counsel to structure over-collateralized loans with what we believe to be strong creditor protections and contractual controls over borrower operations. In many cases, the Advisor works to obtain contractual governance rights and board observer seats to protect principal and maximize post-investment returns. Deals usually include original issue discounts, upfront fees, exit fees and/or equity participations through warrants or direct equity stakes.
 Trading and Secondary Market Purchases. A key element in maximizing investment returns in secondary purchases is buying and selling investments at the best available prices. The Advisor has a dedicated trading staff for both the highly specialized traded loan market and for high-yield bonds. Through its trading operations, the Advisor maintains its established relationships with a network of broker-dealers in the debt securities markets. These relationships provide the Advisor with access to the trading dynamics of existing or potential investments and assist it in effectively executing transactions. These relationships may also lead to the early identification of potential investment opportunities for the Company.
 6


Portfolio Management & Monitoring. The Advisor actively monitors the financial performance of its portfolio companies and market developments. This constant monitoring permits the Advisor to update position risk assessments, seek to address potential problems early, refine exit plans, and make follow-on investment decisions quickly. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process.
 We consider board observation and information rights, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors, and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. We have developed a monitoring template that seeks to ensure compliance with these standards and that is used as a tool by the Investment Committee to assess investment performance relative to plan.
  
• | Deal teams maintain contact with portfolio company management through regularly scheduled and ad hoc conference calls and onsite visits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deal teams review portfolio company progress relative to plan and pre-determined performance benchmarks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adverse or unexpected developments, as well as consequential routine updates, are reported to the Investment Committee and thoroughly discussed at regularly scheduled weekly meetings. If merited, the Investment Committee will hold ad hoc meetings as necessary to address urgent issues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deal teams, with Investment Committee approval, encourage portfolio company managers to catalyze events to monetize holdings for greater return, or where needed, take corrective actions to address shortfalls to plan or benchmarks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All existing portfolio holdings are formally reviewed in detail by the entire Investment Committee once per quarter at the Advisor’s quarterly portfolio review.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investment Committee and Decision Process. The Advisor’s investment process is organized around the Investment Committee that provides for a centralized, repeatable decision process. The Investment Committee meets weekly and, with respect to each fund the Advisor advises, certain members of the Investment Committee are voting members. The voting members of the Investment Committee for the Company are currently James E. Keenan, Jason A. Mehring, R. Marshall Merriman, Jr., Howard M. Levkowitz, Rajneesh Vig, Nik Singhal, and Philip M. Tseng. Approval by a simple majority vote of the voting members of the Investment Committee is required for the purchase or sale of any investment. No voting member has veto power. The Advisor’s investment process is designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns and preserve downside protection.
 Investment structure 
 Once the Advisor determines that a prospective portfolio company is a suitable investment, it works with the management of that company, any intermediaries and other capital providers, including senior and junior debt security investors and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. 
 Most of our new investments are primarily in the form of senior secured loans, which generally have terms of three to ten years. We obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of the senior and junior secured loans. The collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 
 In the case of the senior secured and junior loans, the Advisor tailors the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that aims to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, the Advisor seeks to limit the downside potential of our investments. The Advisor may accomplish this through requiring a total return on our investment (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk or through incorporating call protection into the investment structure. The Advisor may also negotiate covenants in connection with our investments that protect the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. 
 The Advisor structures unsecured and subordinated debt securities and loans in which we may invest to have relatively high floating or fixed interest rates that provide us with current investment income. These debt securities and loans generally have terms of up to ten years. Such unsecured and subordinated debt securities and loans may have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the loan. Also, some of these loans will be collateralized by a subordinate lien on some or all of the assets of the company. 
 In some cases, our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest payable to be payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest. To the extent interest is PIK, it is payable through the increase of the principal amount of the loan by the amount of the interest due on the then-outstanding principal amount of the loan. We are required to recognize PIK interest, a non-cash source of income, as taxable income, increasing the amounts we are required to distribute to stockholders to qualify for the federal income tax benefits applicable to RICs.

In general, our debt investments include financial covenants and terms that require the portfolio company to reduce leverage over time, thereby enhancing its credit quality. These methods may include, among others: maintenance leverage covenants requiring a decreasing ratio of debt to cash flow; maintenance cash flow covenants requiring an increasing ratio of cash flow to interest expense and possibly other cash expenses such as capital expenditures, cash taxes and mandatory principal payments; and debt incurrence prohibitions, limiting a company’s ability to re-lever its balance sheet. In addition, limitations on asset sales and capital expenditures prevent a company from changing the nature of its business or capitalization without our consent. 
 Structurally, subordinated loans usually rank junior in priority of payment to senior debt, such as senior bank debt, and are often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. However, subordinated loans rank senior to common and preferred equity in a borrower’s capital structure. Due to their higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to senior loans, subordinated loans generally earn higher interest yields than senior secured loans. We believe that subordinated loans offer an attractive alternative investment opportunity. In many cases investors in subordinated loans receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers, and from time to time also may receive warrants to purchase equity securities. 
 Our debt investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Warrants we receive with our debt may require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We generally seek to structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, and we generally seek to structure puts or rights to sell such securities back to the company upon the occurrence of specified events. 
 Our equity investments may consist of preferred equity that pays dividends on a current basis or preferred equity that does not pay current dividends. Preferred equity generally has a preference over common equity as to distributions on liquidations and dividends. In some cases, we may acquire common equity. Our equity investments frequently are not control-oriented investments, and in many cases, we acquire equity securities as part of a group of private equity investors in which we are not the lead investor. We may also receive equity through portfolio company restructurings. Our preferred and common equity investments typically are made in conjunction with loans to these companies. 
 Ongoing relationship with portfolio companies 
 The Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Advisor monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair values of our investments, which may include the following and other methods: 
  
• | assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparisons to other companies in the industry;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | attendance at and participation in board meetings;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | review of interim and annual financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retention of third-party valuation firms to assist in determination of fair value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Managerial assistance 
 As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance or exercising strategic or managerial influence over such companies. We may receive fees for these services. The Advisor will provide managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that request this assistance. Employees of BlackRock devoted to the Company have experience providing managerial assistance to private operating companies like our portfolio companies, and such assistance has tended to be related to board representation and to strategic and financing transactions. The Advisor generally will not receive any direct compensation from our portfolio companies for providing managerial assistance although it may do so from time to time. 
 8


Investment rating system 
 The Advisor generally employs a grading system for our entire portfolio. The Advisor grades all loans on a scale of 1 to 4. This system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower’s business, the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors considered relevant. Generally, the Advisor assigns only one loan grade to each portfolio company for all loan investments in that portfolio company; however, the Advisor will assign multiple ratings for different investments in one portfolio company, when appropriate. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 Grade 1: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is substantially within or above the Advisor’s expectations and whose risk factors are neutral to favorable to those at the time of the original investment or subsequent restructuring. 
 Grade 2: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is below the Advisor’s expectations and that require closer monitoring; however, the adverse impact may be deemed temporary, and the most likely outcome is that no loss of investment return (interest and/or dividends) or principal is expected. 
 Grade 3: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is below the Advisor’s expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination or subsequent restructuring. Some loss of investment return is likely, but no loss of principal is expected. Companies graded 3 generally present a higher risk of liquidity pressure and/or covenant breach over the next six to twelve months. 
 Grade 4: Investments in portfolio companies whose performance is materially below the Advisor’s expectations where business trends have deteriorated and risk factors have increased substantially since the original investment or subsequent restructuring, potentially resulting in a breach of covenants or other event of default. Investments graded 4 are those for which some loss of principal or invested capital is likely. 
 The Advisor monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, the Advisor and Board of Directors review these investment ratings on a quarterly basis. Our average investment rating was 1.90 at December 31, 2020 and 1.39 at December 31, 2019. The following is a distribution of the investment ratings of our portfolio companies at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
 
 
 | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2019 | 
------------------+-------------------+-------------+-------------------+--
Grade 1 | $ | 189,012,640 | | $ | 543,022,093
Grade 2 | | 198,713,376 | | | 163,762,457
Grade 3 | | 38,605,618 | | | — 
Grade 4 | | 51,136,642 | | | 43,074,531 
Not Rated | | 1,557,200 | | | — 
Total investments | $ | 479,025,476 | | $ | 749,859,081

 The investment rating process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated by the investment team, led by a senior investment professional that is responsible for the portfolio company relationship. This evaluation generally is completed no less frequently than quarterly. At the Advisor’s periodic and timely meetings, the transaction team presents an update on the activities of any company rated below Grade 1. Each quarter, all investment professionals attend a separate investment rating meeting. At these quarterly meetings, the investment team responsible for each portfolio investment reviews each portfolio company and suggests a rating for each investment for discussion among the investment professionals. At the conclusion of discussion, and subject to the approval of the Company’s Interim CEO, the quarterly internal investment ratings are presented to the Board of Directors for their review. 
 Valuation Procedures 
 We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined, consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the 1940 Act. We value our assets on a quarterly basis. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 
 Securities traded on a recognized securities exchange are valued using the closing price on the exchange on the valuation date. Investments for which market prices from an exchange are not readily available are valued using the last available bid price or quote provided by an independent pricing service or one or more broker-dealers or market makers, unless they are deemed not to represent fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Because the Company expects that there will not be a readily available market for all of the investments in its portfolio, the Company expects to value a significant portion of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Determination of fair value involves subjective judgements and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize.
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts based on whether or not market quotations are used to value the Company’s investments. BCIA may believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller, a purchaser, or the market for a particular security may cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a “forced” sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread.
 With respect to the Company’s investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process applied each quarter, as described below: 
  
(i) | The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the Advisor responsible for the portfolio investment;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | The investment professionals provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms engaged by the Board of Directors (with the exception of statements and materials related to investments priced directly by the Advisor as described in (iv) below), such firms conduct independent appraisals each quarter and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Advisor;
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations prepared by the independent valuation firm and the Advisor, as applicable;
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | The fair value of certain investments, comprising in the aggregate, less than 5% of the Company’s net asset value and no more than 15% of total positions held, respectively, may be determined by the Advisor in good faith without the engagement of an independent valuation firm in accordance with the Company’s valuation policy; provided that if only the threshold with respect to the number of all positions valued at zero or immaterial amounts is exceeded, the Advisor may request Board approval to not request a fair valuation from an independent valuation firm for all such positions; and
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Advisor, the respective independent valuation firms (to the extent applicable) and the Audit Committee.

Investment Management Agreement 
 At a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders, held on February 18, 2015, the Company’s stockholders approved a new investment management agreement between the Company and BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock Advisors”) to permit BlackRock Advisors to serve as the Company’s investment adviser following the completion of the sale of certain assets related to managing the Company from the Previous Advisor, 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC, formerly BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors LLC. BlackRock Advisors is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. The Transaction was completed on March 6, 2015 and, pursuant to the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement, dated as of March 6, 2015, BlackRock Advisors began managing the Company’s investment activities. Prior to the consummation of the Transaction, the Company had entered into an investment management agreement with 52nd Street Capital Advisors LLC, the Company’s previous adviser. The BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement had the same management and incentive fee terms until March 6, 2017 and different management and incentive fees terms thereafter. For Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee terms prior to March 6, 2017, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2020. 
 On January 16, 2018, BlackRock Advisors assigned the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement, dated March 6, 2015, to a wholly owned subsidiary, BCIA, the Advisor, pursuant to Rule 2a-6 of the 1940 Act and the Company entered into a new investment management agreement with BCIA (the “Previous Management Agreement”). 
 At the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders, held on May 1, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved, among other matters, the proposal to allow the Company to increase leverage by approving the application to the Company of a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to become effective on May 2, 2020 (the 
 10


“Current Management Agreement” or the “Management Agreement”). Effective at the same time, the Company’s Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee were reduced as follows: (i) Base Management Fee was reduced from 1.75% of total assets to 1.50% on total assets up to 200% of net asset value and 1.0% on total assets that exceed 200% of net asset value; (ii) Incentive Fee based on net investment income was reduced from 20% over a 7% hurdle to 17.5% over a 7% hurdle; and (iii) Incentive Fee based on net capital gains was reduced from 20% to 17.5%.
 The Current Management Agreement will be in effect from year-to-year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of the directors who are not interested persons. The Company’s Board of Directors approved the continuation of the Current Management Agreement on November 3, 2020.
 Base Management Fee 
 Under the Management Agreement, the investment advisor, subject to the overall supervision of the Board, manages the day-to-day operations and provides the Company with investment advisory services. For providing these services, effective May 2, 2020, the Advisor receives a Base Management Fee at an annual rate of 1.50% of total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents), including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage, payable quarterly in arrears based on the asset valuation as of the end of the prior quarter. Additionally, the Base Management Fee is calculated at 1.00% on assets that exceed 200% of net asset value of the Company. Prior to May 2, 2020, the Base Management Fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents). The Base Management Fee for any partial quarter is prorated.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $10,799,832, $12,425,101, and $14,138,788, respectively, in Base Management Fees under the investment management agreement. 
 Incentive Management Fee 
  
(i) | Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income
----+----------------------------------------

 The Current Management Agreement provides that the investment advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to an Incentive Fee under certain circumstances. The Incentive Fee has two parts. The first portion is based on income other than capital gains and is calculated separately for each calendar quarter and will be paid on a quarterly basis. Effective May 2, 2020, the Incentive Fee based on income is calculated as follows: 
  
• | No Incentive Fee based on income other than capital gains for any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for such calendar quarter, that exceeds 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter but is less than approximately 2.12% (8.48% annualized).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 17.5% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for any calendar quarter that exceeds approximately 2.12% (8.48% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to May 2, 2020 (and since March 6, 2017), the Incentive Fee based on income was calculated as follows: 
  
• | No Incentive Fee based on income other than capital gains for any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for such calendar quarter, that exceeds 1.75% (7.00% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter but is less than approximately 2.19% (8.75% annualized).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, for any calendar quarter that exceeds approximately 2.19% (8.75% annualized) of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such quarter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The calculations described above will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than a quarter and adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such quarter.
 11


The payment of any such Incentive Fee based on income otherwise earned by our investment advisor will be deferred if, for the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, the Annualized Rate of Return is less than 7.0% of net assets attributable to common stock at the beginning of such four quarter period as adjusted for the net proceeds from any common stock issuances and the cost of any common stock repurchases during such four full calendar quarter period, with any deferred Incentive Fees to be carried over for payment in subsequent quarterly calculation periods to the extent such payment can then be made in accordance with the investment management agreement. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company incurred $6,304,333, $8,751,521, and $8,510,866, respectively, in Incentive Fees based on income. 
 BlackRock Advisors, in consultation with the Company’s Board of Directors, agreed to waive Incentive Fees based on income after March 6, 2017 to June 30, 2019 (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). BCIA had agreed to honor such waiver. The Advisor voluntarily waived a portion of its Incentive Fees based on income from July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Advisor has waived Incentive Fees of $6,304,333, resulting in no net Incentive Fees for the year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Advisor has waived Incentive Fees of $6,901,924, resulting in net Incentive Fees of $1,849,597. The waiver for Incentive Fees based on income was $8,510,866 for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in no net Incentive Fees based on income incurred by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, there was $1,849,597, and $1,849,597, respectively, of Incentive Fees payable based on income. The payment of Incentive Fee based on income of $1,849,597 at December 31, 2020 was deferred pursuant to the Incentive Fee deferral provision discussed above.
  
(ii) | Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
-----+--------------------------------------------

 The second portion of the Incentive Fee is based on capital gains and is calculated separately for each Annual Period. Effective May 2, 2020, our investment advisor will be entitled to receive an Incentive Fee based on capital gains for each Annual Period in an amount equal to 17.5% of the amount by which (1) net realized capital gains occurring during the period, if any, exceeds (2) gross unrealized capital depreciation, if any, occurring during the period. In calculating the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains payable for any period, investments are accounted for on a security-by-security basis. In addition, the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined using the “period-to-period” method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period will be based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by realized capital losses for the period and unrealized capital depreciation for the period. Prior to May 2, 2020 (and since March 6, 2017), the incentive fee on capital gains was calculated at an annual rate of 20%. 
 The capital gains Incentive Fee as calculated under the Current Management Agreement and the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement as described above, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulted in no capital gains incentive fee accrual. The Company did not have any cumulative accrued balance at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 
  
(iii) | Calculation of Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
------+----------------------------------------------------

 For purposes of calculating the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, (i) “Annual Period” means the period beginning on July 1 of each calendar year, including the calendar year prior to the year in which the investment management agreement became effective, and ending on June 30 of the next calendar year; (ii) “Annualized Rate of Return” is computed by reference to the sum of (i) the aggregate distributions to common stockholders for the period in question and (ii) the change in net assets attributable to common stock (before taking into account any Incentive Fees otherwise payable during such period); (iii) “net assets attributable to common stock” means total assets less indebtedness and preferred stock; and (iv) “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means net investment income (as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles) accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter excluding any accruals for or payments in respect of the Incentive Fee. 
 The Company is required under GAAP to accrue a hypothetical capital gains Incentive Fee based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this hypothetical capital gains Incentive Fee assumes all unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation is realized in order to reflect a hypothetical capital gains Incentive Fee that would be payable at each measurement date. If such amount is positive at the end of the period, then we recorded a capital gains Incentive Fee equal to 17.5% of such amount, for period ended after May 2, 2020 (or 20%, for period ended prior to May 2, 2020), less the amount of capital gains related Incentive Fees already accrued in prior periods. 
 If the resulting amount is negative, the accrual for GAAP in a given period may have resulted in the reduction of an expense. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. However, it should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the Advisers Act, the Current Management Agreement or the BlackRock Advisors Management Agreement. Amounts actually paid were consistent with the Advisers Act, which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital appreciation. In accordance with GAAP, the hypothetical liquidation for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 resulted in no capital gains Incentive Fee.
 12


 
(iv) | Calculation of Capital Gains
-----+-----------------------------

 Capital gains and losses are calculated using the proceeds received and either (i) fair market value at the beginning of the Annual Period or (ii) cost for investments acquired during the Annual Period. In calculating whether the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is payable with respect to any period, the Company accounts for assets on a security-by-security basis. In addition, the Company uses the “period-to-period” method pursuant to which the portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains for any period is based on realized capital gains for the period reduced by realized capital losses and gross unrealized capital depreciation for the period. Based on current interpretations of Section 205(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by the SEC and its staff, the calculation of unrealized depreciation for each portfolio security over a period is based on the fair value of the security at the end of the period compared to the fair value at the beginning of the period. Incentive Fees earned in any of the periods described above are not subject to modification or repayment based upon performance in a subsequent period. The Advisor has agreed to change the calculation of its Incentive Fees based upon gains for the period from July 1, 2018 until June 30, 2019, solely with respect to any change in the fair market value of the Company’s investment in preferred stock of KAGY Holding Company, Inc. by using $11,952,516 (March 31, 2018 value) as the fair market value at the beginning of the Annual Period instead of $329,881 (June 30, 2018 value).
 Indemnification 
 The Current Management Agreement provides that in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations thereunder, the Advisor is not liable to us or any of our stockholders for any act or omission by it or its employees in the supervision or management of our investment activities or for any loss sustained by us or our stockholders, and provides for indemnification by us of its members, directors, officers, employees, agents and control persons for liabilities incurred by it in connection with their services to us, subject to certain limitations and conditions. 
 Duration and termination 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Current Management Agreement will remain in effect for successive periods of twelve months, provided that each continuance is specifically approved at least annually by both (1) the vote of a majority of our Board or the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and (2) the vote of a majority of the Board who are not parties to the Management Agreement or interested persons (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. On November 3, 2020, our Board approved the Current Management Agreement for a successive twelve months. We may terminate the Current Management Agreement as a whole at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our Board or a majority of our outstanding voting securities or by the Advisor, on 60 days’ written notice by either party to the other which can be waived by the non-terminating party. The Current Management Agreement will also immediately terminate in the event of its assignment. 
 Administration agreement 
 We have entered into an administration agreement with BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., a subsidiary of BlackRock, under which the Administrator provides certain administrative services to us. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $1,457,979, $1,403,419, and $1,702,723, respectively, for such administrative services expenses. 
 Competition 
 A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. We compete with other BDCs, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) funds, commercial financing companies, insurance companies, high yield investors and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies has intensified. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the restrictions that the Code imposes on us as a RIC.

Leverage 
 Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”), which has an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $440,000,000, a stated commitment termination date of February 19, 2020, and a stated maturity date of February 19, 2021. The interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency borrowings thereunder is generally LIBOR plus an applicable margin of either 1.75% or 2.00% based on a pricing grid using the borrowing base as a multiple of the combined debt amount. The interest rate applicable to Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) borrowings thereunder is generally the prime rate in effect plus an applicable margin of either 0.75% or 1.00% based on a pricing grid using the borrowing base as a multiple of the combined debt amount. The Credit Facility’s commitment may increase in size, under certain circumstances, up to a total of $750,000,000. From the commitment termination date to the stated maturity date, the Company is required to repay outstanding principal amounts under the Credit Facility on a monthly basis in an amount equal to 1/12th of the outstanding amount at the commitment termination date. On June 5, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Facility which extended the commitment termination date on the Credit Facility to June 5, 2021 and the maturity date to June 5, 2022. On March 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Facility which (i) permanently reduced the aggregate amount of multicurrency commitments under the Credit Facility from $440,000,000 to $400,000,000 and (ii) reduced the amount of shareholders’ equity required under the Credit Facility from $500,000,000 plus 25% of net proceeds from the sale of equity interests to $450,000,000 plus 25% of net proceeds from the sale of equity interests. On August 30, 2019, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Credit Facility which (i) permanently reduced the aggregate amount of multicurrency commitments under the Credit Facility from $400,000,000 to $340,000,000 and (ii) reduced the amount of shareholders’ equity required under the Credit Facility from $450,000,000 plus 25% of net proceeds from the sale of equity interests to $375,000,000 plus 25% of net proceeds from the sale of equity interests after August 30, 2019. On March 31, 2020, the Company had entered into a Waiver and Agreement to the Credit Facility to waive certain requirements under the Credit Facility from March 31, 2020 through May 10, 2020 (the “Waiver Period”), which was extended to August 10, 2020 with a Second Waiver and Agreement that the Company entered into on May 1, 2020. As a result of the Fifth Amendment of the Credit Facility (described below), the waivers are no longer required or applicable. 
 On May 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Credit Facility which (i) extends the maturity date on loans made under the Credit Facility from June 5, 2022 to June 5, 2023, (ii) changes the interest rate applicable to borrowings to LIBOR plus an applicable margin equal to either 2.00% or 2.25% depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain indebtedness, (iii) reduces the aggregate commitment under the Credit Facility from $340,000,000 to $300,000,000, (iv) makes certain changes to the calculation of the borrowing base, and (v) reduces the amount that the Company’s commitment may increase in size, under certain circumstances, from $750,000,000 to $375,000,000. The most recent amendment also modifies the financial covenants under the Credit Facility to (i) reduce the amount of shareholders’ equity required under the Credit Facility from $375,000,000 to $275,000,000 plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of Equity interests by the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) reduce the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150% and (iii) incorporate a new senior coverage ratio to be maintained by the Company.
 Unsecured Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022 
 On June 13, 2017, the Company issued $143,750,000 in aggregate principal amount ($125,000,000 of the initial offering and $18,750,000 of the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option) of 5.00% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) under an indenture, dated as of June 13, 2017. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering, including the exercise of the overallotment option, were approximately $139,800,000. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2022, unless previously converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. The interest rate on the notes is 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017. Holders may convert their notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2021, in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of a note, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election at an initial conversion rate of 118.2173 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.46 per share of the Company’s common stock. On or after December 23, 2021, the Company may redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at its option in accordance with their terms. 
 The 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2022 Convertible Notes, at the time of issuance the Company estimated separate debt and equity components, and an original issue discount equal to the equity component was recorded in additional paid-in-capital in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Staffing 
 Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of BlackRock or the Administrator and its affiliates, pursuant to the terms of the Current Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Each of our executive officers is an employee of the Advisor or the Administrator and its affiliates. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Advisor. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately 50 investment professionals who focus on origination and transaction development and monitoring of our investments. We reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to the Advisor under the Current Management Agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Advisor relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Advisor to us. In addition, we reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of expenses it incurs in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent as well as our allocable portion of any costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Administrator to us. 
Regulation 
 We are a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisors or sub-advisors), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless that change is approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investment. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these are fundamental policies and they may be changed without stockholder approval. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. We have adopted procedures to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and such regulations. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 The NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance regulations 
 The NASDAQ Global Select Market has adopted corporate governance regulations with which listed companies must comply. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Privacy principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator). 
 15


We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to BlackRock’s employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.
