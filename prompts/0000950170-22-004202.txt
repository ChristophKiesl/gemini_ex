Item 1. Business
General
 
We serve major, national and independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies around the world and offer products and services with respect to the various phases of a well’s economic life cycle.

2021 was a transformative year at Superior. Following our emergence from bankruptcy, we embarked on a diligent effort to reconfigure our operations and organization to maximize shareholder value, enhance margin growth and have a more disciplined approach, both operationally and financially (the “Transformation Project”).

The Transformation Project has been focused around three sequential phases:
 •Business Unit Review – analyzing strategic changes and executing various non-core asset divestitures, which emphasized product optimization and margin enhancement to maximize the cash flow profile of our business units and focus on our core competencies (collectively, the “Business Unit Review”);
 •Geographic Focus – reviewing our footprint and improving capital efficiency by focusing on low-risk, high reward geographies to maximize returns; and
 •Right Size Support – streamlining support to match optimized business units that represent our core portfolio and consolidating our operational footprint to align the size of our operations with current demand to provide a superior value proposition and exhibit capital discipline.
    The evaluation and implementation of the Business Unit Review is substantially complete, which has resulted in lower revenue with increased margins. The Right Size Support and Geographic Focus components are ongoing and should be completed during 2022.
   Historically, we provided a wide variety of services and products to many markets within the energy industry. During 2021, we realigned our core businesses to focus on products and services that we believe meet the criteria of (1) being critical to our customers’ oil and gas operations, (2) facing low or no competition from the three largest global oilfield service companies, (3) requiring deep technical expertise through the design or use of our product or service, and (4) being unlikely to become a commoditized product or service to our customers. The result of this approach is a portfolio of business lines grounded in our core mission of providing high quality products and services while maintaining the trust and serving the needs of our customers, with an emphasis on free cash flow generation and capital efficiency for us.
 
In connection with our Transformation Project, our reportable segments were changed to Rentals and Well Services.
    Recent Developments
 
As used herein, “Superior,” “we,” “us”, “our” and similar terms refer to (i) prior to the Emergence Date (as defined below), SESI Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Superior Energy Services, Inc.) (“Predecessor”) and its subsidiaries and (ii) after the Emergence Date, Superior Energy Services, Inc. (formerly known as Superior Newco, Inc.) and its subsidiaries (“Successor”). Additionally, the use the following terms refer to our operations:

"Predecessor Period" | January 1, 2021 through February 2, 2021 
"Successor Period" | February 3, 2021 through December 31, 2021

Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11
 
On December 4, 2020, we and certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the “Affiliate Debtors”) entered into an Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Amended RSA”) that amended and restated in its entirety the Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”), dated September 29, 2020, with certain holders of SESI, L.L.C.’s (“SESI”) outstanding (i) 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “7.125% Notes”) and (ii) 7.750% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the “7.750% Notes”). The parties to the Amended RSA agreed to the principal terms of a proposed financial restructuring of the Affiliate Debtors, which was implemented through the Plan (as defined below).
 
   On December 7, 2020, the Affiliate Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, and, in connection therewith, the Affiliate Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the proposed Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Plan”). After commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Affiliate Debtors continued to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Affiliate Debtors filed a motion for approval of a debtor-in-possession financing facility, and on December 8, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved such motion and entered an interim order approving the financing (the “Interim DIP Order”). In accordance with the Interim DIP Order, on December 9, 2020, we, as guarantor and SESI, as borrower, entered into a $120 million Senior Secured Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Facility”). On January 19, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Affiliate Debtors’ entry into the DIP Credit Facility on a final basis.
 
On January 19, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 289, confirming and approving the Plan.

Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11
 
On February 2, 2021 (the “Emergence Date”), the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied or waived and we emerged from Chapter 11.

Bankruptcy Claims

During the Chapter 11 Cases, the Affiliate Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements setting forth, among other things, the assets and liabilities of each of the Affiliate Debtors, subject to the assumptions filed in connection therewith. Certain holders of pre-petition claims that were not governmental units were required to file proofs of claim by the bar date of January 7, 2021. Certain holders of pre-petition claims that were governmental units were required to file proofs of claim by the bar date of June 7, 2021. The Affiliate Debtors’ have received proofs of claim, primarily representing general unsecured claims, of approximately $1.7 billion. The Bankruptcy Court disallows claims that have been acknowledged as duplicates. Claims totaling approximately $1.4 billion have been withdrawn or disallowed. As a result of the claims resolution process post-emergence, the Affiliate Debtors agreed to allow certain claims classified per the Plan as Class 6 General Unsecured Claims against the Parent. Per ASC 852-10, liabilities are measured at their allowed claim amount, and the result of allowing these claims increased liabilities subject to compromise prior to emergence.

On the Emergence Date and pursuant to the Plan:
   •Administrative expense claims, priority tax claims, other priority claims and other secured claims were paid or will be paid in full in the ordinary course (or receive such other treatment rendering such claims unimpaired);
 •General unsecured creditors for the Affiliate Debtors remained unimpaired and received payment in cash, in full, in the ordinary course; 
 •General unsecured creditors for the Predecessor received their pro rata share of a cash pool in the amount of $125,000;
 •Eligible holders of the claims arising as a result of holding either the 7.125% Notes or the 7.750% Notes against the Affiliate Debtors received their pro rata share of:
 •A cash payment equal to 2% of the principal amount of 7.125% Notes or 7.750% Notes held by all holders who did not opt out of receiving a cash payout; or
•Solely to the extent that such a holder timely and validly elected to opt out of receiving the cash payout or was otherwise deemed to have opted out of receiving the cash payout, (A) 100% of the Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Emergence Date, subject to dilution, and (B), to the extent such holder was an “accredited investor” or “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of the SEC’s rules, subscription rights to participate in an equity rights offering (the “Equity Rights Offering”);
 •The Affiliate Debtors conducted the Equity Rights Offering through an offering of subscription rights for the purchase of Class A common stock on a pro rata basis; and,
 •Predecessor equity interests were cancelled and new Class A common stock was issued to settle claims arising as a result of holding either the 7.125% Notes or the 7.750% Notes, as noted above.
    Prior to the Emergence Date, the Equity Rights Offering was completed in accordance with the Plan, which resulted in the issuance of 735,189 shares of Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock issued in the Equity Rights Offering was exempt from
   registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) pursuant to section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
 
The costs of our efforts to restructure our capital, prior to and during the Chapter 11 Cases, along with all other costs incurred in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, have been material.

On the Emergence Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and a Certificate of Amendment of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”).

Also, on the Emergence Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”). The descriptions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Certificate of Amendment which are incorporated by reference herein.
 
Credit Facility
 
On the Emergence Date, pursuant to the Plan, we entered into a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders and letter of credit issuers named therein providing for a $120.0 million asset-based secured revolving Credit Facility, all of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit (the “Credit Facility”). The issuance of letters of credit will reduce availability under the Credit Facility dollar-for-dollar. On the Emergence Date, the Credit Facility replaced the DIP Credit Facility and the undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the former DIP Credit Facility were deemed outstanding under the Credit Facility. All accrued and unpaid fees and other amounts outstanding thereunder were paid in cash in full as well. The Credit Facility will mature on December 9, 2024.

The borrowing base under the Credit Facility is determined by reference to SESI’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ (i) eligible accounts receivable, (ii) eligible inventory, (iii) solely during the period from the Emergence Date until the earlier of December 9, 2022 and the date that unrestricted cash of SESI and its wholly-owned subsidiaries is less than $75.0 million, eligible premium rental drill pipe and (iv) so long as there are no loans outstanding at such time, certain cash of SESI and its subsidiary guarantors, less reserves established by the administrative agent in its permitted discretion.

Availability under the Credit Facility will be the lesser of (i) the commitments and (ii) the borrowing base. Subject to certain conditions, upon request and with the consent of the participating lenders, the total commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased to $170.0 million. SESI’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us and all of SESI’s material domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our, SESI’s and the subsidiary guarantors’ assets, other than real property.

Any borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest, at SESI’s option, at either an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.00% to 3.50% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% per annum, in each case on the basis of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, SESI is required to pay (i) a letter of credit fee, (ii) to the issuing lender of each letter of credit, a fronting fee and (iii) commitment fees. Upon the cessation of LIBOR, the Credit Facility provides for the use of alternative benchmark rates for the determination of the borrowing rate, and the cessation of LIBOR will not have a material impact on us.
 
Unless all loans are paid off and letters of credit outstanding are cash collateralized and the Credit Facility terminated, the Credit Facility requires, subject to permitted exceptions, compliance with various covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, permitted investments, liens on assets, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. The Credit Facility also requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 if (a) an event of default has occurred and is continuing or (b) availability under the Credit Facility is less than the greater of $20.0 million or 15% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base.

On May 13, 2021, SESI, SESI Holdings, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto entered into a first amendment and waiver to the Credit Facility (the “First Amendment and Waiver to the Credit Facility”) to, among other things, (i) extend the deadline thereunder for the delivery of our consolidated unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 to June 1, 2021 and (ii) obtain a limited waiver of potential defaults under the Credit Facility related to a delayed public filing of such financial statements after the original deadline for delivery of such financial statements.
 
On May 28, 2021, SESI, L.L.C., SESI Holdings, Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto entered into a waiver to the Credit Facility to (i) extend the deadline under the Credit Agreement for the delivery of Superior Energy Services, Inc.’s consolidated unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and the calendar months ending April 30, 2021 and May 31, 2021 to July 15,
   2021 and (ii) agree that until the unaudited financial statements and a revised borrowing base certificate in connection therewith are delivered, the lenders will not be required to make any advances requested. As discussed below, we have filed the required financial statements and delivered the revised borrowing base certificate in satisfaction of this requirement.
 
On July 15, 2021, SESI, the Former Parent, and the subsidiary guarantors party thereto entered into a waiver to the Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, and certain other financial institutions and other parties thereto as lenders to (i) extend the deadline under the Credit Facility for the delivery of our consolidated unaudited financial statements (x) as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 to September 30, 2021 and (y) as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and the calendar months ending April 30, 2021, May 31, 2021, July 31, 2021 and August 31, 2021 to October 30, 2021, (ii) obtain a limited waiver of potential defaults under the Credit Facility related to a delayed public filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q with respect to the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021 (including related financial statements) after the original deadline (and confirmation of such waiver as it pertains to the quarterly report on Form 10-Q with respect to the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021), and (iii) agree that until the quarterly unaudited financial statements and a revised borrowing base certificate in connection with each such quarter is delivered, the lenders will not be required to make any advances requested. We filed our consolidated unaudited financial statements as of, and for, the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 and delivered a revised borrowing base certificate within the required timeframe.
 
On November 15, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver to our Credit Agreement to (i) extend the deadline under the Credit Agreement for the delivery of our consolidated unaudited financial statements as of, and for, the quarter ended September 30, 2021 and the calendar month ending October 31, 2021 to December 10, 2021, (ii) obtain a limited waiver of potential defaults under the Credit Agreement related to a delayed public filing of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 after the original deadline, and (iii) agree that until the quarterly unaudited financial statements and a revised borrowing base certificate in connection with such quarter are delivered, the lenders will not be required to make any advances requested by Borrower. We filed our consolidated unaudited financial statements as of, and for, the quarter ended September 30, 2021 and delivered a revised borrowing base certificate within the required timeframe. In addition, the Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, permit the disposition of the HB Onshore Rentals Business (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
 
On February 10, 2022, we entered into a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement to, among other things, provide us with additional flexibility around making asset sales. Specifically, the Credit Agreement was amended to refresh the amount of properties sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to the “Substantial Portion” exception to $0 as of January 31, 2022. The “Substantial Portion” exception allows us to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of properties so long as the aggregate value of all such properties sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of do not exceed (a) 10% of our gross book value of the assets during the four fiscal year quarter period ending with the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made, or (b) 10% of our consolidated net sales or net income during the four fiscal year quarter period ending with the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made. The Credit Agreement was also amended to add a new asset sale exception that allows us to make additional asset sales up to $25.0 million so long as (a) liquidity is greater than $100.0 million, (ii) unused availability under the Credit Agreement is greater than $25.0 million, and (iii) we receive 100% cash consideration to the extent that the property being sold is otherwise included in the calculation of the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement.

On March 8, 2022, we entered into a Fourth Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit us to file SES Energy Services India Pvt. Ltd, a private limited company of India and an indirect subsidiary, for bankruptcy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India without triggering a default under the Credit Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Facility, including the related amendments thereto, is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Stockholders Agreement
 
On the Emergence Date, in order to implement the governance related provisions reflected in the Plan, the stockholder’s agreement, dated February 2, 2021 (the “Stockholders Agreement”), was executed, to provide for certain governance matters. Other than the obligations related to Confidential Information (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement), the rights and preferences of each stockholder under the Stockholders Agreement will terminate when such stockholder ceases to own any shares of Class A common stock.
 
The foregoing description of the Stockholders Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the document, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amendments to Stockholders Agreement
          We and stockholders holding a majority of our Class A common stock entered into an amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, effective May 14, 2021, extending the deadline to provide our stockholders unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements from 45 days after the conclusion of a quarter to 60 days after such quarter (or, if applicable, the first business day thereafter).
 
We and stockholders holding a majority of our Class A common stock entered into the Second Amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, effective May 31, 2021, extending the deadline to provide our stockholders the unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 to no later than July 15, 2021.
 
We and stockholders holding a majority of our Class A common stock entered into the Third Amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, effective as of July 14, 2021, extending the deadline to provide our stockholders the unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 to no later than September 30, 2021 and October 31, 2021, respectively.
 
We and stockholders holding a majority of our Class A common stock entered the Fourth Amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, effective as of November 15, 2021, extending the deadline to provide our stockholders the unaudited consolidated quarterly financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2021 to no later than December 10, 2021 and making certain technical amendments to the financial statement delivery mechanics.
 
We and stockholders holding a majority of our Class A common stock entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Stockholders Agreement, effective as of February 9, 2022, which provides that if an officer or other authorized agent has been granted authority to approve a matter or take other action pursuant to a board-approved delegation of authority matrix, prior approval of the board will be deemed obtained without any further approval from the board.

COVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions
 
During 2021, the significant business disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic impacted customers, vendors and suppliers in all geographical areas where we operate as well as the broader economies of affected countries. However, there are signs that business activity around the world has adjusted and will continue to improve in 2022.
 
The recent wave of COVID-19 cases related to the Omicron variant somewhat dampened the expectations regarding economic recovery and higher demand for oil. For example, due to travel restrictions put in place as a result of Omicron, the global oil demand forecast for 2022 was originally revised down by forecasters, including the IEA and EIA, primarily to account for projected reduced jet fuel use. However, the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than prior waves of COVID-19 variants. Consequently, management believes that this surge should not halt the recovery in oil demand. With widespread vaccination campaigns, and the apparent lower rates of serious illness and hospitalization resulting from the recent wave, this wave is likely to have a lesser impact on the economy and demand for oil than previous COVID-19 variants.
 
Absent any further material COVID-related disruption, oil demand is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels before the end of 2022. We also expect to accelerate work on projects that were delayed or slowed due to pandemic-related travel restrictions.
 
Products and Services
 
We offer a wide variety of specialized oilfield services and equipment generally categorized by their typical use during the economic life of a well. A description of the products and services offered by each of our segments is as follows:
 
The products and service offerings of Rentals are comprised of value-added engineering and design services, rental of premium drill strings, tubing, landing strings, completion tubulars and handling accessories, manufacturing and rental of bottom hole assemblies, and rentals of accommodation units.
 
The products and service offerings of Well Services are comprised of risk management, well control and training solutions, hydraulic workover and snubbing services, engineering and manufacturing of premium sand control tools, and onshore international production services. The Well Services segment also includes the operations of our offshore oil and gas property.
 
For information about our operating segments and financial information by operating segment and geographic area, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Customers
 
Our customers are major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in the geographic areas in which we operate. There were no customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019. A reduction in sales to any of our existing large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Competition

We provide products and services worldwide in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small or regionally focused companies, and large or international companies. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including but not limited to changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by factors such as weather, pandemics, and geopolitics, and general economic conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services.
Potential Liabilities and Insurance

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, well blowout or vessel loss, may result in substantial claims for damages.

As is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Nonetheless, our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case.
 
We maintain a liability insurance program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which we are liable, but well control costs are not covered by this program. These policies include primary and excess umbrella liability policies with limits of $200 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution incidents. All of the insurance policies we purchase contain specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions and are subject to either deductibles or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of insurance we maintain will be sufficient to fully protect us against all liabilities related to our business.
 
Government Regulation

Our business is significantly affected by federal, state and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 •worker safety standards;
 •the protection of the environment;
 •the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; and
 •the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites.
 
Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our underground injection wells, trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 
We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.
 
   Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
 
Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before commencing operations, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our operations, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry and infrastructure industry in general. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
 
Climate Change

In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, collectively referred to as greenhouse gasses (“GHGs”). The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirement related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and gas operations. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives.
 
At the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which went into effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emission, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 to meet this objective. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international commitments.

Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.

In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have
   been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
 
Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our productivity and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.

Raw Materials
 
We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations and reduce demand for our products and services. Examples of seasonal events that negatively affect our operations include high seas associated with cold fronts during the winter months and hurricanes during the summer months in the Gulf of Mexico, and severe cold during winter months in the U.S. land market area.
Human Capital
 
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,300 employees. Approximately 28% of our employees are subject to union contracts, all of which are in international locations. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. We strive to employ a dynamic workforce to complement our core values. Our hiring policy forbids the discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive company with people of various backgrounds, experience, culture, styles and talents. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews periodically and are included in the determination of their compensation and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a safety culture.
