Overview 
 
Enterprise Diversified, Inc. (formerly White Dove Systems, Inc., Interfoods Consolidated, Inc., and then Sitestar Corporation) was incorporated in Nevada on December 17, 1992. On June 1, 2018, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to “Enterprise Diversified, Inc.” Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “ENDI,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refers to Enterprise Diversified, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company operated through five reportable segments:
 

● | Asset Management Operations - this segment includes revenue and expenses derived from our various joint ventures, service offerings, and initiatives undertaken in the asset management industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real Estate Operations - this segment includes revenue and expenses related to the management of properties held for investment and held for resale through Mt Melrose (prior to the sale of 65% of our equity in Mt Melrose on June 27, 2019) located in Lexington, Kentucky, and revenue and expenses related to the management of legacy properties held for investment and held for resale through EDI Real Estate located in Roanoke, Virginia;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Internet Operations - this segment includes revenue and expenses related to our sale of internet access, hosting, storage, and other ancillary services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Operations - this segment includes any revenue and expenses from nonrecurring or one-time strategic funding or similar opportunities previously undertaken, and any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of the year ended December 31, 2019, and for all prior periods presented, Home Services Operations are reported as discontinued operations. The management of the Company also continually reviews various business opportunities for the Company, including those in other lines of business.
 
In previous periods, the Company reported under the following six business segments: Asset Management, Mt Melrose, HVAC, Internet, Real Estate, and Corporate. In an effort to highlight the direction of the Company and increase segment transparency, these historical segments were reorganized during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. Additional reorganizations were made as of January 1, 2019, in order to appropriately reflect the similarities in the Company’s real estate operations. As a result, the “Mt Melrose” and legacy “Real Estate” segments are referred to collectively as “Real Estate,” with the “HVAC” segment being referred to as “Home Services.” “Corporate” and other additional investments are combined under “Other Operations.” The “Asset Management” and “Internet” segments remain unchanged. See below for additional information on the activity included in each respective segment report.
 
Note that as of May 24, 2019, as per the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 28, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its Home Services Operations, via its subsidiary, Specialty Contracting Group, LLC (formerly known as HVAC Value Fund, LLC), to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser, Rooter Hero Plumbing, Inc. (“Rooter Hero”). In the transaction, the Company sold and conveyed all of the subsidiary’s personal property and customer lists and records, excluding stock inventory and other current assets. As part of the transaction, Rooter Hero assumed the subsidiary’s obligations under lease and/or loan agreements for all outstanding vehicles and equipment, as well as the obligations to service all of the subsidiary’s remaining customer accounts going forward. No cash consideration was exchanged in the transaction. As consideration for the transaction, Rooter Hero will pay monthly royalties for the sixty (60) months following the closing, calculated on the basis of any revenue received from the customer accounts transferred. Under such royalty arrangements, the Company will receive 7.5% of any monthly revenue generated from qualified sales during the first year, and 5% of any monthly revenue during years two through five. Royalties received will be reduced by pre-approved warranty-related costs for select customers.
 
Additionally, on June 27, 2019, as per the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 3, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in Mt Melrose, LLC to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser, Woodmont Lexington, LLC (“Woodmont”). As consideration for the transaction, Woodmont paid the Company $100,000 and agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio.
 
Asset Management Operations
 
ENDI created a wholly-owned subsidiary on October 10, 2016, named Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”). Willow Oak is an asset management operational platform oriented to the value-investing community. Value investing and knowledge of the global value-investing community are core competencies of Willow Oak’s management. Willow Oak intends to apply its core competencies to become a hub for the value-investing community, offering various forms of affiliations with respected value investment managers. Such affiliations to date include fund seeding and reinvestments, fund launching, investor relations, and fund management administrative support. The Company intends to actively expand its Willow Oak platform with additional affiliations and services that enhance the value of the Willow Oak platform to all affiliated funds. 
 
Willow Oak began offering its fund management services (“FMS”) to external funds on November 1, 2018, when it signed a consulting services agreement with Arquitos Capital, a domestic and offshore private investment fund controlled by Steven Kiel, a Company director and our principal executive officer. Willow Oak also provides FMS to the Bonhoeffer Fund. FMS consists of services not typically provided by traditional third-party providers to the hedge fund industry, including: access to the Willow Oak network, investor relations and marketing, administration and compliance, interface to traditional service providers, standard tools and best practices repository, and access to Willow-Oak-vetted third-party service providers.
 
Willow Oak expanded its affiliations on October 1, 2019, forming a new joint venture with Focused Compounding Capital Management, LLC (“Focused Compounding Capital Management”) through a wholly-owned Company subsidiary, Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC (“Willow Oak Capital Management”). Willow Oak Capital Management was made a 10% owner of Focused Compounding Capital Management and is entitled to receive 10% of any and all gross fees (including management fees and incentive fees), before expenses, generated from any and all separately managed accounts and funds that are managed or advised, directly or indirectly, by Focused Compounding Capital Management, including a new private investment fund, Focused Compounding Fund, LP, that was launched by Focused Compounding Capital Management on January 1, 2020. Under the terms of the joint venture, Focused Compounding Capital Management’s principals, Geoff Gannon and Andrew Kuhn, agreed to bear sole responsibility for any and all investment advisory matters associated with the conduct of Focused Compounding Capital Management’s business, while Willow Oak Capital Management agreed to bear the organizational expenses of the fund launch and also to provide Willow Oak’s FMS to Focused Compounding Capital Management on an ongoing basis.

Real Estate Operations
 
The Company operates its real estate operations through EDI Real Estate, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and, indirectly, through Mt Melrose, LLC, a formerly consolidated subsidiary. Mt Melrose, LLC owns and operates a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, which was acquired pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017, with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company (“Old Mt. Melrose”). On January 10, 2018, Mt Melrose, LLC (“New Mt Melrose”) completed its first acquisition of 44 real properties under the agreement, and on June 29, 2018, it completed its second acquisition of 69 additional real properties under the agreement. However, during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2018, the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement and no further acquisitions were consummated. A third-party property manager was engaged during this quarterly period ended December 31, 2018, to manage certain of the real properties previously acquired. Management also determined that it was necessary to right-size New Mt Melrose’s operations to reduce its level of high-interest debt. In an effort to expedite the optimization of the Mt Melrose portfolio, management further determined that a dedicated operator was necessary to manage the subsidiary. Accordingly, on June 27, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose, LLC to Woodmont, who agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of New Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio. The general terms and conditions governing the arrangement between the Company and Woodmont are set forth in an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Mt Melrose, LLC.
 
Our other real estate operations include activity from a legacy real estate investment portfolio held through EDI Real Estate, LLC. The portfolio, primarily located in the Roanoke area of Virginia, includes residential properties and vacant land. The portfolio includes single-family homes that are currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager, as well as other properties currently listed for sale.
  
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations through Sitestar.net, a wholly-owned subsidiary that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, third-party software as a reseller, and various ancillary services. Sitestar.net provides services and support to customers in the United States and Canada.
Discontinued Operations - Home Services Operations
 
The Company operated its home services operations through Specialty Contracting Group, LLC (formerly known as HVAC Value Fund, LLC), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on the management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. As of December 31, 2017, the subsidiary had closed on six acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.02 million, which included earn-outs of approximately $325,000. For all six acquisitions, all earn-outs had been paid in full as of December 31, 2018. On May 24, 2019, the Company completed its divestiture of the home services operations to Rooter Hero. As of the year ended December 31, 2019, and for all prior periods presented, all revenue and expenses related to home services operations have been reported as discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Asset Management Operations
 
The Company operates its asset management operations business through Willow Oak.
 
In 2016, the Company made a strategic determination to fund a seed investment totaling $10 million through Willow Oak to assist in the launch of Alluvial Fund, LP, a private investment partnership that was launched on January 1, 2017 by unaffiliated sponsor and general partner, Alluvial Capital Management, LLC. The Company had determined that Willow Oak’s support of Alluvial Capital Management, LLC and its direct investment in Alluvial Fund were both beneficial and necessary undertakings in conjunction with establishing an asset management operations business and gaining credibility within that industry. Under a side letter agreement with Alluvial Fund’s general partner, Willow Oak agreed not to fully withdraw its capital account prior to a date five years after the effective date of the side letter agreement. However, on December 31, 2017, pursuant to an amendment to the side letter agreement dated December 15, 2017, the Company caused $3.0 million to be withdrawn from Alluvial Fund in order to partially fund the Company’s acquisitions of real estate in the 2018 Mt Melrose transactions. As of December 31, 2019, Willow Oak continues to hold its remaining direct investment in Alluvial Fund. Investment gains and losses are reported as revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
 
In furtherance of establishing the asset management operations business, Willow Oak signed a fee share agreement on June 13, 2017, with Coolidge Capital Management, LLC (“Coolidge”), whose sole member is Keith D. Smith, who is also an ENDI director. Willow Oak is the sole member of Bonhoeffer Capital Management, LLC, the general partner to Bonhoeffer Fund, LP, a private investment partnership. Under their agreement, Willow Oak paid all start-up expenses and pays agreed-upon operating expenses that are not partnership expenses, and Willow Oak receives 50% of all performance and management fees earned by the general partner.
 
On August 1, 2018, Willow Oak, through a wholly-owned Company subsidiary, Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC (“Willow Oak Capital Management”), launched a newly organized private investment partnership, Willow Oak Select Fund, LP (“Select Fund”). Willow Oak Capital Management served as the general partner of Select Fund. Select Fund ultimately dissolved in June 2019 so that other joint ventures and partnerships could be pursued.
 
On November 1, 2018, Willow Oak also entered into a fund management services agreement with Arquitos Investment Manager, LP, which is managed by our chairman and principal executive officer, Steven L. Kiel, to provide Arquitos with Willow Oak’s Fund Management Services (“FMS”) consisting of the following services: investor relations, marketing, administration, legal, accounting and bookkeeping, annual audit coordination, and liaison to third-party service providers. As consideration for the services, Arquitos pays Willow Oak a fixed fee and a performance-based fee.
 
On October 1, 2019, Willow Oak partnered with Geoff Gannon and Andrew Kuhn to form Focused Compounding Capital Management, LLC (“Focused Compounding”). This new joint venture, of which Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC is a 10% owner, manages capital through separately managed accounts and a private partnership launched January 1, 2020. As a member of the general partner, Willow Oak provides ongoing FMS and operational support in addition to covering all one-time expenses associated with the launch of Focused Compounding Fund, LP. As consideration for the arrangement, Willow Oak is entitled to 10% of gross management and performance fees earned by Focused Compounding. In addition to hosting a popular investing podcast, the individual principals of Focused Compounding share investment news and advice through a subscription-based service.

Real Estate Operations
 
ENDI created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Mt Melrose”), on December 14, 2017, to acquire a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017, with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC (“Old Mt. Melrose”), a Kentucky limited liability company owned by Jeff Moore, then an ENDI director. On January 10, 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed a first acquisition from Old Mt. Melrose of 44 residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. On June 29, 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed a second acquisition from Old Mt. Melrose of an additional 69 residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company accounted for the first and second purchases of properties as an asset acquisition (consisting of a concentrated group of similar identifiable assets, including land, buildings, improvements, and in-place leases). As has been reported, on June 27, 2019 the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose, LLC to Woodmont. The Company deconsolidated the operations of New Mt Melrose, LLC on June 27, 2019, as a result of no longer having a controlling financial interest.
 
ENDI created a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary on July 10, 2017, named EDI Real Estate, LLC, to hold ENDI’s legacy portfolio of real estate. As of December 31, 2019, through EDI Real Estate, LLC, ENDI owns a legacy real estate investment portfolio that includes eight residential properties and vacant land. Our real estate portfolio under EDI Real Estate, LLC is primarily focused in the Roanoke area of Virginia. The portfolio includes single-family homes, both rented and vacant, that are managed by a third-party property management company. The leases in effect as of December 31, 2019, are based on annual time periods and include month-to-month provisions after the completion of the initial term.
 
State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry and do not vary significantly from one community to another. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances, govern rental properties and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas.
 
Internet Operations
 
Sitestar.net is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, web hosting, and various ancillary services. We provide services to customers in the United States and Canada. This segment markets and sells narrow-band (dial-up and ISDN) and broadband services (DSL and fiber-optic). Additionally, we market and sell web hosting and related services to consumers and businesses.
 
Our primary competitors include regional and national cable and telecommunications companies that have substantially greater market presence, brand-name recognition, and financial resources compared to Sitestar.net. Secondary competitors include local and regional ISPs.
 
The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar.net. Competitors often offer incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces.
 
There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security, and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues.
 
As of December 31, 2019, the focus of our internet segment is to generate cash flow, work to make our costs variable, and reinvest in our operations when an acceptable return is available. We did not make significant reinvestments into the internet segment during 2019.
 
Management is currently identifying the market value for domain names owned by the Company in order to assess potential income opportunities. Management evaluates these domain names for third-party sales potential, as well as for other marketing opportunities that could generate new revenue from current customers who utilize the domains.
 
Discontinued Operations - Home Services Operations
 
Prior to May 24, 2019, the Company operated its home services segment through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Specialty Contracting Group, LLC (formerly known as HVAC Value Fund, LLC). The Company, along with JNJ Investments, LLC, an unaffiliated third party, organized and launched Specialty Contracting Group, LLC on June 13, 2016. On May 18, 2018, the Company terminated its operating agreement with JNJ Investments, LLC, dated June 13, 2016.

As part of the amended and restated promissory note, the Company provided an additional contribution in the amount of $55,000 on May 18, 2018. The terms of the promissory note provide for interest in the amount of 10% annually, a repayment date no later than April 29, 2020, and the issuance of warrants in Triad Guaranty, Inc. equal to 2.5% of the company.
