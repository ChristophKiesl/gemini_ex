References in this document to “Full House”, the “Company”, “we”, “our,” or “us” refer to Full House Resorts, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates.

The following table presents selected statistical and other information concerning our properties as of December 31, 2016:

(1) | Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel opened its newly-constructed hotel in phases from May 2015 through September 2015.


(2) | Includes a 190-room hotel that we own and operate, and an adjacent 104-room hotel that we lease pursuant to a capital lease with a bargain purchase option.


(3) | Under the Facilities Agreement with Hyatt Equities, L.L.C., we have the ability to provide rooms to our guests at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort upon mutually agreeable rates, as well as other amenities and services that cater to our guests and support our operations. We also have an agreement with Hyatt to rent a villa for use by our designated casino guests. Hyatt has approximately 422 guest rooms. 

We manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States.  Accordingly, Stockman’s Casino and Grand Lodge Casino comprise a Northern Nevada business segment, while Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel, Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel, and Rising Star Casino Resort are currently distinct segments.  Our corporate headquarters are in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Our revenues are primarily derived from gaming sources, which include revenues from slot machines, table games and keno. Play at our slot machines accounts for most of our revenues, but we also offer a wide range of table games. We set minimum and maximum betting limits for our properties based on market conditions, customer demand and other factors. Our gaming revenues are derived from a broad base of guests that includes both high- and low-stakes players. We also derive a significant amount of revenues from our hotel rooms, food and beverage outlets, retail outlets, entertainment and our golf course at the Rising Star Casino Resort. Our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. Additionally, our operating results may be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our guests, weather conditions affecting access to our properties, achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies, taxation and other regulatory changes, and competitive factors, including but not limited to, additions and improvement to the competitive supply of gaming facilities. We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. 
Our mission is to maximize shareholder value. We seek to increase revenues by providing our guests with their favorite games and amenities, high-quality customer service, and appropriate customer loyalty programs. Our customers include local gaming customers who represent a high potential for repeat visits along with drive-in tourist patrons. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of revenue growth and expense management. We also assess the potential impact of growth and development opportunities, including capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing third-party properties. 


5

All of our casino properties are operated by us 24 hours each day, every day of the year.  We also operate the hotel and food and beverage operations at Silver Slipper, Bronco Billy's, Rising Star and Stockman's. At the Grand Lodge Casino, Hyatt Regency manages the hotel and food and beverage outlets.  
2016 Highlights
Bronco Billy's Acquisition and Amended and Restated Credit Facilities
On May 13, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado for consideration of $31.1 million. This acquisition diversifies our operations into a new geographical market.

Concurrent with the acquisition of Bronco Billy's, we entered into an amended and restated First Lien Credit Facility with a group of banks led by Capital One Bank, N.A., which includes a term loan of $45 million and revolving loan of $2 million. We also entered into an amended and restated Second Lien Credit Facility with ABC Funding, LLC which includes a term loan facility increase from $20 million to $55 million, of which the additional proceeds of $35 million were primarily used to complete our acquisition of Bronco Billy's.  As part of the amended and restated Second Lien Credit Facility, on May 13, 2016, the Company granted the second lien lenders 1,006,568 redeemable warrants. 
Rights Offering 
We completed a rights offering on November 10, 2016 and received a total of $5 million of gross proceeds ($4.64 million of net proceeds after offering costs) through the issuance of 3,846,154 shares of common stock at a price of $1.30 per share. We intend to use the net proceeds from the rights offering to partially fund certain capital expenditure growth projects at our existing properties, as well as for general corporate purposes.
 For further information on the above, see the consolidated financial statements set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
Operating Properties

Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel

On October 1, 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Silver Slipper Casino Venture, LLC (which owned the Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel) for approximately $72.2 million.  The Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel is situated on the far west end of the Mississippi Gulf Coast near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and has approximately 37,000 square feet of gaming space, a fine-dining restaurant, a buffet, a quick-service restaurant and two casino bars. The property sits at the western end of an approximately eight-mile-long white sand beach, the closest such beach to the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. The Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel currently generates the most revenue and operating income of any of our properties and its customers are primarily from communities in southern Louisiana, including the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas, and southwestern Mississippi. 
We lease approximately 38 acres, consisting of the seven-acre parcel on which the casino and hotel is situated and approximately 31 acres of marshlands. The lease term ends in April 2058. Between February 2019 and October 2027, we have the option to purchase the land. Management expects to exercise the buyout option depending on the Company's resources and future capital market conditions. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the phased opening of our newly constructed 129-room hotel, which includes nine premium gaming customer suites. During 2017, we anticipate building a swimming pool and beach club, as well as a new food and beverage offering, at the property.
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel was acquired in May 2016 for $31.1 million and includes three adjoining licensed operations in Cripple Creek, Colorado known as Bronco Billy's Casino, Buffalo Billy's Casino and Billy's Casino (collectively referred to as "Bronco Billy's"). Bronco Billy’s occupies a significant portion of the key city block of Cripple Creek’s prime “casino strip” and contains approximately 17,000 square feet of gaming space, 24 hotel rooms, a steakhouse and four casual dining outlets. Bronco Billy's also leases certain parking lots and buildings, including a portion of the hotel and casino, under a long-term lease. The lease has six renewal options in three-year increments to 2035 and the Company has the right to buy out the lease at any time during its term. Bronco Billy's customers are primarily from the Colorado Springs metropolitan area, the second-
6

largest metropolitan area in Colorado with a population of approximately 700,000. Its population increased approximately 1.7% between 2015 and 2016.

Rising Star Casino Resort

On April 1, 2011, we acquired all of the operating assets of Grand Victoria Casino & Resort, L.P. through Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary. We paid approximately $43 million for the property, including re-branding costs to rename the property Rising Star Casino Resort.  The property is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Rising Star offers approximately 40,000 square feet of casino space, a contiguous 190-room hotel, an adjacent leased 104-room hotel, five dining outlets and an 18-hole Scottish links golf course. The 104-room hotel is leased pursuant to a capital lease agreement which expires in 2027 and contains a bargain purchase option. During recent years, this property was adversely affected by the legalization of gaming in Ohio where several new competitors are now located. All of such potential casinos in Ohio are now open.
We are making significant improvements to the Rising Star facilities including a partial hotel refurbishment, the creation of a new VIP gaming room, sense-of-arrival improvements in the main pavilion and on the casino boat, construction of a new restaurant on the casino floor, and construction of an RV park. We are also in the process of developing a 10-car ferry boat service across the river to Kentucky. Commencement of the ferry boat service is subject to approvals from various agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard. 
Under Indiana regulations, we are allowed to have significantly greater casino gaming capacity than we utilize today. The Company has been exploring the possibility of relocating this excess gaming capacity to another location in Indiana. This would require legislative approval and there is no certainty that such approval will be received or, even if any proposed legislation were to become law, that the Company would be successful in developing a new gaming, lodging and entertainment facility.
Northern Nevada 

Stockman’s Casino

We acquired Stockman’s Casino in Fallon, Nevada on January 31, 2007, for approximately $27 million.  In 2008, we sold a Holiday Inn Express that was part of the original acquisition for approximately $7.2 million. Stockman’s Casino is located approximately one hour from Reno, Nevada and includes approximately 8,400 square feet of gaming space. The facility has a bar, a fine-dining restaurant and a coffee shop. Stockman's primarily serves the local market of Fallon and surrounding areas, including the nearby Naval Air Station, the United States Navy's premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility and home of the "Top Gun" school.
During the third quarter of 2016, we began construction on a number of exterior improvements to the property, including a new parking lot, a new digital marquee sign, lush landscaping surrounding the casino's main entrances, and new administrative offices connected directly to the casino. Construction work on the parking lot and new digital marquee sign was completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the remaining enhancements during 2017. 
Grand Lodge Casino

On June 28, 2011, we entered into a lease with Hyatt Equities, L.L.C. ("Hyatt") to operate the Grand Lodge Casino at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort and entered into an agreement with HCC Corporation to acquire the operating assets and certain liabilities related to the Grand Lodge Casino for approximately $1.4 million. The Grand Lodge Casino is located within the Hyatt Regency in Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe and includes approximately 18,900 square feet of casino space.  The Hyatt Regency is one of three AAA Four Diamond hotels in the Lake Tahoe area, and is one of only three AAA Four Diamond hotels in northern Nevada. Its customers consist of both locals and tourists visiting the Lake Tahoe area.
  On November 25, 2015, the lease was amended to extend our relationship and refurbish and improve the casino facility. The amendment included (i) an agreement for Hyatt to renovate the casino up to a maximum cost of $3.5 million and for the Company to purchase up to $1.5 million of new gaming devices, equipment or other capital expenditures, and (ii) an increase in monthly rent from $125,000 to $145,833 commencing on January 1, 2017 (or the date which Hyatt's renovations are completed, whichever is later), and $166,667 commencing on January 1, 2018. The Company and Hyatt are working together on the refurbishment, which began in February 2017 and is currently scheduled to be completed in June 2017. 
7

The lease amendment also included, among other obligations, a five-year extension of the initial term of the lease to August 31, 2023 and deferral of Hyatt's option to purchase our leasehold interest and related operating assets to January 1, 2019.
Board and Executive Transition
On November 28, 2014, Full House, and Daniel R. Lee, Bradley M. Tirpak and Craig W. Thomas (jointly and severally, the “Shareholder Group”), entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve actions taken by the Shareholder Group to call a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders for the purpose of, among other things, nominating certain individuals to our board of directors and amending the Company’s by-laws (the “Solicitation”).
 The Settlement Agreement, and later the Amended Settlement Agreement, resulted in, among other items, the increase of our board of directors from five to eight members and related appointments, the resignation of Andre M. Hilliou and Mark J. Miller as directors, the Shareholder Group's irrevocable withdrawal of its Solicitation, and agreement to certain customary standstill restrictions, a mutual release of claims between the Company and the Shareholder Group, and certain reimbursements. On January 9, 2015, Mr. Hilliou's employment as Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Miller's employment as Chief Operating Officer were terminated.
On November 28, 2014, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Lee (the “Employment Agreement”) pursuant to which Mr. Lee serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer. The Employment Agreement was effective as of November 28, 2014 and expires on November 30, 2018, unless earlier terminated.
Prior Projects, Proposals and Terminations

American Place
In August 2015, we responded to a "request for proposal" ("RFP") by the Indianapolis Airport Authority ("Airport Authority") with a proposal for a $650 million lifestyle complex, anchored by a modest-sized casino, known as "American Place". Under our proposal, we would act as the "master developer" (as such term is used in the RFP) of the project and plan to seek partners for many of its aspects. The project was contingent, among other things, on being selected by the Airport Authority; on changes in the state gaming laws and other regulatory approvals that would allow the relocation to Indianapolis of approximately half of the gaming devices that are licensed to operate in Rising Sun, Indiana; and on obtaining financing for the proposed project. In March 2016, the Airport Authority canceled the RFP process.
Terre Haute

In January 2017, State Senator Ford of Terre Haute, Indiana introduced legislation that would allow Full House to relocate half of its permitted gaming capacity to a new casino to be developed in Terre Haute. Such development requires approval of both houses of the state legislature and the approval or acquiescence of the governor. On February 16, 2017, the Public Policy Committee of the Indiana State Senate voted 5-5 on Senator Ford's bill; it required a majority vote to proceed to the Senate floor. There are other methods whereby the proposal could be considered by the broader legislature, although the Public Policy Committee is the normal and most expedient route. The legislature meets annually and is currently in session, with adjournment anticipated at the end of April. There is no certainty at this time that such legislation will ever become law or that such casino will ever be developed.
Buffalo Thunder Casino and Resort

From September 2011 to September 2014, we advised the Pueblo of Pojoaque on the operations of Buffalo Thunder Casino and Resort in Santa Fe, New Mexico, along with the Pueblo’s Cities of Gold and other gaming facilities.
Majestic Star Agreement Termination

On March 21, 2014, we entered into an agreement with The Majestic Star Casino LLC to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of Majestic Mississippi, LLC, which operates a casino located in Tunica, Mississippi commonly known as the Fitz Tunica Casino & Hotel.  On June 23, 2014, the agreement was terminated and on August 21, 2014, we settled all disputes related to this unconsummated matter by forfeiting $1.7 million in deposits. We also incurred additional acquisition-related fees for this transaction, including $0.6 million of costs associated with the potential financing of the purchase.

Government Regulation

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations and include, without limitation, the following conditions and restrictions:

• | Periodic license fees and taxes must be paid to state and local gaming authorities;


• | Certain officers, directors, key employees, and gaming employees are required to be licensed or otherwise approved by the gaming authorities;


• | Individuals who must be approved by a gaming authority must submit comprehensive personal disclosure forms and undergo an exhaustive background investigation, the costs for which must be borne by the applicant;


• | Changes in any licensed or approved individuals must be reported to and/or approved by the relevant gaming authority;


• | Failure to timely file the required application forms by any individual required to be approved by the relevant gaming authority may result in that individual’s denial and the gaming licensee may be required by the gaming authority to disassociate with that individual; and


• | If any individual is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, the gaming licensee is required to disassociate with that individual.

Violations of gaming laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A summary of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors” for additional discussion.
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our Indiana property is subject to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for its riverboat and golf club operations, and our Mississippi property is located near environmental wetlands and discharges wastewater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of the property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owners or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent the property. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.
Competition

The gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities include traditional commercial casinos and casino resorts in various states including on tribal lands and at racetracks, riverboat and dockside gaming, state-sponsored lotteries, video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels, pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog racing and jai alai, sports betting and card rooms.  Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. All of our casinos, as well as other casinos that we may develop or acquire, compete with all these forms of gaming.  We also will compete with any new forms or jurisdictions of gaming that may be legalized, as well as with other types of entertainment. Some of our competitors have more personnel and 
9

greater financial or other resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are: location, with casinos located closer to their feeder markets at an advantage; casino, lodging, entertainment and other hospitality product quality in terms of facilities, customer service and ease of access; breadth of offerings, including the types of casino games and other non-gaming amenities; and marketing, including the amount and frequency of promotions offered to guests.
 
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel

Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel is the western-most casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and competes with several larger casinos located nearby in Hancock County, Mississippi, casinos in Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi and with casinos in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Gulfport and Biloxi are 45 minutes and one hour east, respectively, of the Silver Slipper along Interstate 10. New Orleans and Baton Rouge are one and two hours, respectively, west of Silver Slipper.
Silver Slipper is the closest casino to most of St. Tammany Parish, one of the most affluent and fastest-growing parishes in Louisiana. Louisiana law permits 15 riverboat casinos, one land-based casino, four casinos at racetracks, and in certain areas, a limited number of slot machines at qualifying truck stops. The legislation permitting riverboat and truck stop casinos requires a local referendum and, at the time such legislation occurred, the legalization was rejected by St. Tammany Parish voters. At this time, all licenses for riverboat casinos in Louisiana have been granted and are in operation. Mississippi, which has lower gaming tax rates than Louisiana, does not have a limitation on the number of casino licenses, but requires casinos in certain southern counties to be within 800 feet of the shoreline, as defined by state law.
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel
Bronco Billy's is located in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is a former gold mining town located approximately one hour southwest of Colorado Springs near the base of Pikes Peak. Cripple Creek is now considered a gambling and tourist destination and is one of only three cities in Colorado where commercial gaming is permitted. The other two cities are near Denver. Additionally, two Native American gaming operations exist in southwestern Colorado and there are tribal casinos in Oklahoma, but these are much further from Colorado Springs than Cripple Creek. As of December 31, 2016, there were eight other gaming facilities operating in Cripple Creek. Gaming in Colorado is “limited stakes,” which restricts any single wager to a current maximum of $100.
Rising Star Casino Resort

The Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun, Indiana is one of three riverboat casinos located on the Ohio River in southeastern Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Its closest competitors are each approximately 15 miles away, near bridges crossing the Ohio River. Rising Star also competes with casinos in Ohio; a casino-resort in French Lick, Indiana; and two racetrack casinos near Indianapolis, Indiana.
A Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 2014 may permit a horse racing track in northern Kentucky to install slot machine-like devices, although it has not yet done so. The Indiana legislature also passed legislation in 2015 to allow table games at racetracks (which are now limited to slot machines) beginning in 2021. 
Northern Nevada
Stockman’s Casino

We believe Stockman’s Casino is the largest of several casinos in Churchill County, which has a population of approximately 25,000. A nearby source of additional customers is Naval Air Station Fallon, the United States Navy's premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility and home of the "Top Gun" school. While we are not aware of any significant planned expansion to gaming capacity in the Churchill County area, additional competition may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, while the Navy seems to be currently expanding its base in Fallon, were it to reduce its activities at the base, it would likely have an adverse effect on Stockman's results of operations. 
Grand Lodge Casino

Grand Lodge Casino is one of four casinos located within a five-mile radius in the North Lake Tahoe area.   A fifth casino, scheduled to re-open in 2016 after a refurbishment, has not yet re-opened. Its opening date has been postponed several times and the project entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2016. 

10

Grand Lodge Casino also competes with casinos in South Lake Tahoe and Reno.  There are also numerous Native American casinos in California serving the Northern California market.
Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our customer loyalty programs and specialized marketing campaigns, such as our seasonal "Christmas Casino" event at the Rising Star Casino Resort. We advertise through various channels, including radio, television, internet, billboards, newspapers and magazines, direct mail, email and social media.  We also maintain websites to inform customers about our properties and utilize social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals.  Our customer loyalty programs include the Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, Bronco Billy’s MVP “Most Valuable Players” Club, the Rising Star Rewards Club™, the Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club® and the Stockman’s Winner’s Club.  Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays. 
Our properties do not have coordinated loyalty programs. We do not currently believe that it would be economically advantageous given the disparate locations of our properties. Instead, our loyalty programs focus on providing each casino's customers the amenities they most prefer.
Employees

As of March 14, 2017, we had 13 full-time corporate employees, three of whom are executive officers and two additional senior management employees. Our casino properties had 1,319 full-time and 360 part-time employees as follows:

 | Full-time | Part-time
Silver Slipper Casino and Hotel | 455 | | 95 
Bronco Billy's Casino and Hotel | 253 | | 56 
Rising Star Casino Resort | 431 | | 161
Grand Lodge Casino | 97 | | 44 
Stockman’s Casino | 83 | | 4 


We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions.
