ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Friendable, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company), was incorporated in the State of Nevada.
 
Friendable, Inc. is a mobile-focused technology and marketing company, connecting and engaging users through two distinctly branded applications. The Company initially released its flagship product Friendable, as a social application where users can create one-on-one or group-style meetups. In 2019 the Company moved the Friendable app closer to a traditional dating application with its focus on building revenue, as well as reintroducing the brand as a non-threatening, all-inclusive place where Everything starts with Friendship…meet, chat & date. During 2021 management decided that the Friendable app should no longer be supported and that the Companys resources would be better focused on the development of its second app, the FanPass app (see below).
 
On June 28, 2017, the Company formed a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary called Fan Pass, Inc.
 
Fan Pass is the Companys most recent app/brand, released on July 24, 2020. Fan Pass believes in connecting Fans of their favorite celebrity or artist, to an exclusive VIP or Backstage experience, right from their smartphone or other connected devices. Fan Pass allows an artists fanbase to experience something they would otherwise never have the opportunity to afford or geographically attend. The Company aims to establish Fan Pass as its premier brand and mobile platform that is dedicated to engaging music fans from anywhere around the World with the music artists featured on the FanPassLive App. The Company developed an enhanced version of its Fan Pass application (v2.0) with improved features and attributes which it released on July 24, 2021. This upgrade includes all new UI/UX attributes, upgraded feature sets for artists and fans, an accelerated artist on boarding process and enhanced dashboard features. On August 5, 2021 the Company announced the approval of the Fan Pass v2.0 livestream artist platform by both the Apple App and Google Play Stores. The mobile applications can be downloaded by users worldwide, and Fan Pass v2.0 is also accessible via desktop and web applications. FanPassLive offers artists at all levels and genres, the opportunity to engage fans from one platform, removing the need for multiple sharing platforms. It conveniently provides Exclusive Artist Channels jam-packed with all their relevant content from videos, photos, interviews, and past and upcoming events. While its free for music artists to join, Fan Pass monetizes its business model by using an ALL ACCESS VIP Offering to music fans priced at a $2.99 monthly subscription ($25.99 annual subscription) with a three-day free trial. Fan Pass also offers an Artist Pro monthly subscription of $8.99 which offers the ALL ACCESS VIP, plus advanced dashboard analytics, merchandising store access and promotion of scheduled music events,

On April 5, 2021 the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the state of Nevada to designate 500,000 of its authorized preferred stock as Series D Convertible Preferred. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (whether whole or fractional) that have a Fair Market Value, in the aggregate, equal to the Series D Conversion Price. The Series D Conversion Price shall initially be equal to $10.00 and may be converted, at the option of the holder, at any time, into nonassessable common shares (a) at 80% of the average closing price reported on OTCMarkets for the 20 trading days preceding conversion through June 30, 2021, (b) as amended, at 80% of the average closing price reported on OTCMarkets for the 10 trading days preceding conversion effective July 1, 2021,and (c) as amended, at 50% of the average closing price reported on OTCMarkets for the 10 trading days preceding conversion effective March 3, 2022
 
On January 5, 2022 the Company acquired the intellectual property assets, customer lists, websites and supporting computer programs associated with the music services business of Artist Republik, Inc. in initial consideration for the issuance of 176,986,025 of the Companys common shares. At the end of 12 months following the Closing, in the event the number of shares issued to Seller at the Closing has been diluted below 25% of the total outstanding common shares as of such date, the Company shall issue to the Seller that additional number of shares necessary so that the number of shares issued to Seller is not less than 25% of the then-total issued and outstanding shares of the Company. For a period of 12 months from the Closing Date, the holders of the shares issued pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement shall be limited to selling not more than 10% of the average daily trading volume, in the aggregate, on any given trading day. The Companys preliminary estimate of the fair value of the purchase consideration was $1,047,150, consisting of $637,150 for the initial shares, based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the acquisition date, and $410,000 for the contingent consideration for the future maintenance of the 25% minimum equity threshold referred to above, calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation Starting its business in 2020, Artist Republik is an innovative, decentralized music business that allows independent music artists from around the world to take more control of their own careers through networking, centralized resources, and AI-based management tools. The acquisition is aimed to solidify the Companys now all-encompassing suite of products and music services, positioning the Company as an all-inclusive music offering to both music fans and music artists. With a suite of artist-centric services that extend livestreaming capabilities and virtual performance options, this powerful combination of support and services offered by Fan Pass and Artist Republik will now include music distribution for all artists, while fans can enjoy access to a variety of artist channels across different genres, exclusive live events, behind-the-scenes content, artist merchandising and more. The offering also provides artists more autonomy and freedom over their own music, ticketing streams, blog/social promotion, custom merchandise development, beats/samples sales and more, all without being signed to a record label or giving up their creative rights. In January, 2022 the Company also launched and released FeaturedX.com, a web property acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Artist Republik, FeaturedX has thousands of music artists currently available and is a place where artists can book a guest feature, co-write, MIDI composition or live instrumental tracking for other artists releasing their next single or looking to extend reach and exposure by tapping into these available resources for music production and collaboration.
