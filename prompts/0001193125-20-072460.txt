Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a nationwide provider of credit products and services to small businesses. The products and services we provide to our customers include loans and leases for the acquisition of commercial equipment and working capital loans. Our average original transaction size was approximately $16,000 at December 31, 2019 and our average net investment on Equipment Finance contracts as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $11,000. We acquire our small business customers primarily by offering equipment financing through independent commercial equipment dealers and various national account programs, through direct solicitation of our small business customers and through relationships with select lease and loan brokers. Through these origination partners, we are able to cost-effectively access small business customers while also helping our origination partners obtain financing for their customers. As of December 31, 2019, we serviced approximately 91,000 finance contracts having a total original value of $1.6 billion for approximately 77,000 small business customers. Our revenue consists of interest and fees from our leases and loans and, to a lesser extent, income from our property insurance program and other fee income, and is derived from customers in the United States. 
 The small balance commercial financing market is highly fragmented. We estimate that there are more than 100,000 independent commercial equipment dealers and other intermediaries who sell the types of equipment we finance or require the types of financing we provide. We believe this segment of equipment dealers is underserved because: (1) large commercial finance companies and large commercial banks typically concentrate their efforts on marketing their products and services directly to larger equipment manufacturers and larger distributors, rather than to independent equipment dealers; and (2) many smaller commercial finance companies and regional banking institutions have not developed the systems and infrastructure required to adequately service large volumes of low-balance transactions. We focus on establishing our relationships with independent equipment dealers who value convenient point-of-sale financing programs because we can make their sale process more effective. By providing them with the ability to offer our financing and related services to their customers as an integrated part of their selling process, our origination partners are able to increase their sales and provide better service to their customers. By doing this, we are also able to gather small business customers to which we can sell additional credit products and services through our fully integrated origination platform which allows us to efficiently solicit, process and service a large number of low-balance financing transactions. From our inception in 1997 to December 31, 2019, we have processed approximately 1,267,000 lease applications and originated over 525,000 new leases. 
 Through the issuance of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured deposits, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Marlin Business Bank (MBB), serves as the Companys primary funding source. MBB receives time deposits through a variety of sources including: directly from customers, through the use of on-line listing services, and through the use of deposit brokers. In the future MBB may elect to offer other products and services to the Companys customer base. As a Utah state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank, MBB is supervised by both the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. 
 On January 13, 2009, Marlin Business Services Corp. became a bank holding company and, as such, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. On September 15, 2010, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia confirmed the effectiveness of Marlin Business Services Corp.s election to become a financial holding company (while remaining a bank holding company) pursuant to Sections 4(k) and (l) of the Bank Holding Company Act and Section 225.82 of the Federal Reserve

  Boards Regulation Y. Such election permits Marlin Business Services Corp. to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity, including the maintenance and expansion of our reinsurance activities conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, AssuranceOne, Ltd. (AssuranceOne). 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe several characteristics may distinguish us from our competitors, including the following: 
 Multiple Sales Origination Channels. We use multiple sales origination channels to penetrate effectively the highly diversified and fragmented small-ticket equipment leasing market. We use both direct and indirect origination channels. Our direct channel involves soliciting our existing small business customer base for repeat business as well as identifying other small business customers who need financing. The indirect channel sources financing opportunities through our partner network and our broker network. Our indirect origination channels, which accounted for approximately 77% of the 2019 lease and loan new origination fundings, involve: (1) establishing relationships with independent equipment dealers; (2) securing endorsements from national equipment manufacturers and distributors to become the preferred lease financing source for the independent dealers who sell their equipment; and (3) establishing relationships with independent brokers who identify opportunities for us. Our broker network accounted for 27% of the indirect channels 2019 lease and loan new origination volume. Our direct origination channel accounted for approximately 23% of the 2019 lease and loan new origination volume. 
 Highly Effective Account Origination Platform. Our telephonic direct marketing platform and our strategic use of outside sales account executives offer origination partners a high level of personalized service through our team of sales account executives and sales support personnel. Our business model is built on a real-time, fully integrated customer information database and a contact management and telephony application that facilitate our account solicitation and servicing functions. 
 Comprehensive Credit Process. We seek to manage credit risk effectively at the origination partner as well as at the transaction and portfolio levels. Our comprehensive credit process starts with the qualification and ongoing review of our origination partners. Once the origination partner is approved, our credit process focuses on analyzing and underwriting the small business customer and the specific financing transaction, regardless of whether the transaction was originated through our direct or indirect origination channels. Our underwriting process involves the use of our customized acquisition scorecards along with detailed rules-based analysis conducted by our team of seasoned credit analysts. 
 Portfolio Diversification. As of December 31, 2019, no single small business customer accounted for more than 0.20% of our portfolio balance and leases from our largest origination partner accounted for only 3.82% of our portfolio. Our portfolio is also diversified nationwide with the largest state portfolios existing in California (14%), Texas (12%) and Florida (10%). 
 Fully Integrated Information Management System. Our business integrates information technology solutions to optimize the sales origination, credit, collection and account servicing functions. Throughout a transaction, we collect a significant amount of information on our origination partners and small business customers. The enterprise-wide integration of our systems enables data collected by one group, such as credit, to be used by other groups, such as sales or collections, to better perform their functions. 
 Sophisticated Collections Environment. Our centralized collections department is structured to collect delinquent accounts, minimize credit losses and maximize post charge-off recovery dollars. Our collection strategy employs a delinquency bucket segmentation approach, where certain collectors are assigned to accounts based on their delinquency status. We also stratify and assign our accounts to collectors based on other relevant criteria, such as customers with an early missed payment, risk profile and transaction size. This segmentation approach allows us to assign our more experienced collectors to the late stage delinquent accounts. In addition, the collections department also focuses on collecting delinquent late fees, property taxes, and other outstanding amounts due under the customers contracts.

 Access to Multiple Funding Sources. We have established and maintained diversified funding sources, with our wholly-owned subsidiary, MBB. MBB is currently our primary funding source through the issuance of fixed and variable rate FDIC-insured deposits raised nationally through direct platforms, listing services, and through various deposit brokers. We believe that our proven ability to access funding consistently at competitive rates through various economic cycles provides us with the liquidity necessary to manage our business. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7). 
 Experienced Management Team. Our executive officers have an average of more than 20 years of experience in financial services. As we have grown, we have expanded the management team with a group of successful, seasoned executives. 
Disciplined Growth Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to enhance our current position as a provider of credit services to small and mid-sized businesses by pursuing a strategy focused primarily on organic growth initiatives while actively managing credit risk. We seek to maintain consistent credit quality standards while continuing to pursue strategies designed to increase the number of independent equipment dealers and other origination partners that generate and develop lease and loan customers. We also target strategies to further penetrate our existing origination partners. Additionally, Marlin has historically completed business combinations as part of our growth and market expansion strategies and we may evaluate opportunities for business combinations from time to time. 
Asset Originations 
 Overview of Origination Process. We access our small business customers through our extensive network of independent equipment dealers and through the direct solicitation of our small business customers. We use both a highly efficient telephonic direct sales model and, for strategic larger accounts, outside sales executives to market to our origination partners. Through these sources, we are able to deliver convenient and flexible financing solutions to our small business customers. 
 Our origination process begins with our database of thousands of origination partner prospects located throughout the United States. We develop and continually update this database by purchasing marketing data from third parties, such as Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., by joining industry organizations and by attending equipment trade shows. The prospects in our database are systematically distributed to our sales force for solicitation and further data collection. Sales account executives access prospect information and related marketing data through our contact management software. This contact management software enables the sales account executives to sort their origination partners and prospects by any data field captured, schedule calling campaigns, send e-mails, produce correspondence and documents, manage their time and calendar, track activity, recycle leads and review management reports. 
 Once a sales account executive converts a prospect into an active relationship, we follow a two-pronged approach to managing the relationship. Firstly, all active relationships have an assigned sales account executive, offering our origination partners an individual relationship through which they can address all of their questions and needs, including matters relating to pricing, credit, documentation, training and marketing. Since many of our origination partners have little or no prior experience in using lease financing as a sales tool, our personalized approach facilitates the leasing process for them. Additionally, this approach enables our sales account executives to identify origination partners with the highest growth potential and target resources and attention to growing the most promising relationships. 
 Secondly, customers originated through our partners are referred to our Direct Sales Team. Sales representatives from our Direct team call new customers to introduce Marlin and identify additional financing opportunities with the customer, including working capital needs. Customers receive regular marketing communication from Marlin in addition to outreach from the Direct Sales team. Customers who apply for and 
 
-4- 


  receive additional financing directly from Marlin then are assigned a Direct sales account executive, building a personal relationship with an understanding of the customers business and ongoing financing needs. In the course of providing additional financing directly to customers, we identify new equipment dealers who are in turn referred internally to the Indirect Sales team and added to our database as a prospect, creating a virtuous cycle of growth between the two channels. 
 Other key aspects of our platform aimed at facilitating the lease financing process for origination partners and customers include: 
 

 | ability to submit applications via fax, phone, Internet, mail, e-mail, web portal or integration with our partners digital sales platforms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | credit decisions generally within two hours;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | one-page, plain-English form of lease for transactions up to $100,000;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to use electronic documents with instantaneous routing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | check, wire, or ACH funding to the origination partner once all lease and loan origination conditions are satisfied;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | value-added services, such as application and portfolio reporting, marketing support and sales training on the benefits of financing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | online portal for dealers to view current status and important information about their customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | on-site or telephonic training of the equipment dealers sales force on leasing as a sales tool; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | custom leases and loan programs.
--+---------------------------------

 Sales Origination Channels. We primarily use indirect sales origination channels to penetrate effectively a multitude of origination partners in the highly diversified and fragmented small-ticket equipment leasing market. All inside sales account executives use our telephonic direct marketing sales model to solicit these origination partners and small business customers. 
 Indirect Channels. Our indirect sales origination channels, which account for approximately 86% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio, involve: 
 

 | Independent Equipment Dealer Solicitations. This origination channel focuses on soliciting and establishing relationships with independent equipment dealers in a variety of equipment categories located across the United States. Service is a key determinant in becoming the preferred provider of financing recommended by these equipment dealers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Major and National Accounts. This channel focuses on two specific areas of development: (i) national equipment manufacturers and distributors, where we seek to leverage their endorsements to become the preferred lease financing source for their independent dealers, and (ii) major accounts (larger independent dealers, distributors and manufacturers) with a consistent flow of business that need a specialized marketing and sales platform to convert more sales using a leasing option.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Brokers. Our broker channels account for approximately 14% of the active lease contracts in our portfolio and consist of our relationships with lease brokers and certain equipment dealers who refer small business customer transactions to us for a fee or sell us leases that they originated with small business customers. We conduct our own independent credit analysis on each small business customer in a broker lease transaction. We have written agreements with most of our broker origination partners whereby they provide us with certain representations and warranties about the underlying lease transaction. The origination partners in our broker channels generate leases that are similar to those generated by our direct channels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Direct Channel. This channel focuses primarily on soliciting our existing portfolio of approximately 77,000 small business customers for additional equipment leasing or working capital opportunities. We view our existing small business customers as an excellent source for additional business for various reasons, including (i) retained credit information; (ii) payment history; and (iii) a demonstrated propensity to finance their equipment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Offerings 
 Equipment Loans and Leases. The types of lease products offered by each of our sales origination channels share common characteristics, and we generally underwrite our leases using the same criteria. Our leases provide for non-cancelable rental payments due during the initial lease term. The initial non-cancelable lease term is equal to or less than the equipments economic life. Initial terms generally range from 36 to 72 months. At December 31, 2019, the average original term of the leases in our portfolio was approximately 49 months, and we had personal guarantees on approximately 30% of our leases. The remaining terms and conditions of our leases are substantially similar, generally requiring small business customers to, among other things: 

 | address any maintenance or service issues directly with the equipment dealer or manufacturer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | insure the equipment against property and casualty loss;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | pay or reimburse us for all taxes associated with the equipment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | use the equipment only for business purposes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | make all scheduled payments regardless of the performance of the equipment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We charge late fees when appropriate throughout the term of the lease. Our standard lease contract provides that in the event of a default, we can require payment of the entire balance due under the lease through the initial term and can take action to seize and remove the equipment for subsequent sale, refinancing or other disposal at our discretion, subject to any limitations imposed by law. 
 At the time of application, small business customers select a purchase option that will allow them to purchase the equipment at the end of the contract term for either one dollar, the fair market value of the equipment or a specified percentage of the original equipment cost. We seek to realize our recorded residual in leased equipment at the end of the initial lease term by collecting the purchase option price from the small business customer, re-marketing the equipment in the secondary market or receiving additional rental payments pursuant to the applicable contracts renewal provision. 
 Property Insurance on Leased Equipment. Our lease agreements specifically require customers to obtain all-risk property insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the value of the equipment and to designate us as the loss payee on the policy. If the customer already has a commercial property policy for its business, it can satisfy its obligation under the lease by delivering a certificate of insurance that evidences us as the loss payee under that policy. At December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our small business customers insured the equipment under their existing policies. For the others, we have a master property insurance policy underwritten by a third-party national insurance company that is licensed to write insurance under our program in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This master policy names us as the beneficiary for all of the equipment insured under the policy and provides all-risk coverage for the value of the equipment. 
 In May 2000, we established AssuranceOne, our Bermuda-based, wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary which enables us to reinsure the property insurance coverage for the equipment financed by Marlin Leasing Corporation and MBB for our small business customers. Under this contract, AssuranceOne reinsures 100% of the risk under the master policy, and the issuing insurer pays AssuranceOne the policy premiums, less claims, premium tax and a ceding fee based on a percentage of annual net premiums written. The reinsurance contract is scheduled to expire in September 2023. On January 27, 2010, pursuant to an application filed with the 
 
-6- 


  Bermuda Monetary Authority, AssuranceOne changed from a Class 1 insurer to a Class 3 insurer under the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978, as amended. As a Class 3 insurer, AssuranceOne is permitted to collect up to 50% of its premiums in connection with insurance coverage on equipment unrelated to the Company, meaning that, through AssuranceOne, we may offer an insurance product to cover equipment not otherwise financed through the Company. 
 Working Capital Loans. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company launched Funding Stream, a flexible loan program of MBB. The success of this program and the growing demand by small businesses for convenient working capital solutions prompted the Company to update the name of this program to Working Capital Loans in 2018, while maintaining its commitment to a convenient, hassle-free alternative to traditional lenders and access to capital to help companies grow their businesses. Generally, these loans range from $5,000 to $150,000, have 6 to 24 month terms, and have automated daily or weekly payback. Business owners can apply online, in ten minutes or less, on MarlinCapitalSolutions.com. Approved borrowers can receive funds in as little as two days.

 Information Management 
 A critical element of our business operations is our ability to collect detailed information on our origination partners and small business customers at all stages of a financing transaction and to manage that information effectively so that it can be used across all aspects of our business. Our information management system integrates a number of technologies to optimize our sales origination, credit, collection and account servicing functions. Applications used across our business include: 

 | a customer relationship management system that: (1) summarizes vital information on our prospects, origination partners, competitors and small business customers compiled from third-party data, trade associations, manufacturers, transaction information and data collected through the sales solicitation process; and (2) produces detailed reports using a variety of attributes to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our sales process and customer interactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a call management reporting system that systematically analyzes call activity patterns to improve inbound and outbound calling campaigns for originations, collections and customer service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a data warehouse that aggregates data from origination, sales, credit and servicing attributes based on the performance and preferences of our origination partners and small business customers. Organization leaders have direct access to monitor origination partners, trends, exposure, portfolio concentration and other key performance indicators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Credit Underwriting 
 Credit underwriting is separately performed and managed apart from asset origination. Credit analysts are located in our New Jersey corporate office and our office in Corona, California. Our typical financing transaction involves three parties: the origination partner, the small business customer and us. The key elements of our comprehensive credit underwriting process include the qualification and ongoing review of origination partners, the performance of due diligence procedures on each small business customer and the monitoring of overall portfolio trends and underwriting standards. 
 Qualification and Ongoing Review of Origination Partners. Each origination partner is reviewed and qualified by the credit analyst. The origination partners credit information is reviewed as part of the qualification process. Over time, our database has captured credit profiles on thousands of origination partners. We regularly track all applications and lease and loan originations by source, assessing whether the origination partner has a high application decline rate and analyzing the portfolio performance of the leases and loans originated through that source. Each origination partner is reviewed on a regular basis using portfolio performance statistics as well as any other information noted in the sources file. We will place an origination partner on watch status if its portfolio performance statistics are consistently below our expectations. If the origination partners statistics do not improve in a timely manner, we often stop accepting applications from that origination partner. Some of our business is originated directly with the end user, therefore there is no origination partner involved. 
 Small Business Customer Review. Each small business customers application is reviewed using our customized acquisition scorecards along with our rules-based set of underwriting guidelines that focus on 
 
-9- 


  predictive commercial and consumer credit data. We use proprietary, customized acquisition scorecards for use in our credit decisioning process based on our database of historical information. The scorecards are tested and validated on an ongoing basis by credit and non-credit subject matter experts both inside and outside the organization. The scorecards key attributes and mathematical computations are periodically modified. The scorecards enable us to increase efficiencies and consistency in the credit decisioning process. In 2019, approximately 55% of new credit applications were auto-decisioned using Marlins scorecards. 
 Our underwriting guidelines have been developed and refined by our management team based on proven best practices and its experience in extending credit to small and mid-sized businesses. Our underwriting guidelines require a thorough credit investigation of the small business customer. The guidelines may also include an analysis of the personal credit of the owner, who may guarantee the transaction, and verification of the corporate name and location. The credit analyst may also consider other factors in the credit decision process, including: 

 | financial strength of the business;
--+------------------------------------


 | length of time in business;
--+----------------------------


 | confirmation of actual business operations and ownership;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | management history, including prior business experience;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | size of the business, including the number of employees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | third-party commercial credit data and consumer credit data (when applicable);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | legal structure of business; and
--+---------------------------------


 | fraud indicators.
--+------------------

 Transactions over $150,000 receive a higher level of scrutiny which may include a review of financial statements or tax returns and a review of the business purpose of the equipment to the small business customer. 
 Within two hours of receipt of the application, the credit analyst is usually ready to render a credit decision on transactions less than $50,000. If there is insufficient information to render a credit decision, a request for more information will be made by the credit analyst. Credit approvals are typically valid for up to a 90-day period from the date of initial approval. In the event that the funding does not occur within the initial approval period, a re-approval may be issued after the credit analyst has reprocessed all the relevant credit information to determine that the creditworthiness of the applicant has not deteriorated. 
 In some instances, after a lease is approved, a phone verification with the small business customer is performed by us prior to funding the transaction. The purpose of this call is to review the terms and conditions of the lease contract, confirm the customers satisfaction with the equipment and obtain additional billing information. We will delay paying the origination partner for the equipment if the contract management specialist uncovers any material issues during the phone verification. 
 Account Servicing 
 We service the leases we originate. Account servicing involves a variety of functions performed by numerous work groups, including: 
 

 | entering the lease into our accounting and billing system;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | preparing the invoice information;
--+-----------------------------------


 | generally, filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements on leases in excess of $50,000;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | paying the equipment dealers for leased equipment and services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | billing, collecting and remitting sales, use and property taxes to the taxing jurisdictions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
-10- 


 
 | assuring compliance with insurance requirements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | providing customer service to the leasing customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 Our integrated lease processing and accounting systems automate many of the functions associated with servicing high volumes of small-ticket leasing transactions. 
 Collection Process 
 Our centralized collections department is structured to collect delinquent accounts, open fees, renewal payments and recover post-default dollars to offset losses incurred. This process features a blend of proven methods: 

 | a delinquency bucket approach is in use, in which certain collectors are assigned to accounts based on their delinquency status;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 1 to 30 day accounts are pooled together and called by a team of collectors using a predictive dialer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 31+ accounts are assigned to collectors within the respective delinquency bucket such as 31-60, 61-90 or 91-120 (prior to charge-off);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | during collection calls, the collectors also attempt to collect open late fees, delinquent property taxes, and all other miscellaneous fees; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | collectors are compensated for commission purposes on a team basis, but they are also evaluated individually using various metrics which include call volumes, payments taken, messages, promises to pay and customer centric measurements.

 Initial outbound phone contact is generally made when a lease becomes 10 days past its due date. A predictive dialer is used to create outbound call campaigns based on delinquency. 
 Delinquency notices are sent at 10, 30, 60 and 90-day delinquency stages. Generally, the notices are in paper form, but the collectors also use e-mails to communicate with delinquent lessees. In addition, and as needed, collectors will also generate ad-hoc notices to those most at-risk customers to communicate the seriousness of the delinquency. During the late stage efforts, late charges are assessed and legal options explored, including but not limited to acceleration of the entire lease balance, litigation and repossession. 
 Generally, after an account becomes 120 days or more past-due it is charged-off from the servicing system. Those charged-off accounts are then referred to our internal legal or recovery teams. These teams may initiate legal action against the end-user customer and any personal guarantor if warranted. The accounts may also be referred to an external collection agency or law firm for action to offset the losses taken from charge-off.
All collection related activity and notes are directly input into the servicing system to record and memorialize conversations and action plans with customers. 
 At the end of the initial lease term, on fair market value leases, a customer may return the equipment, continue leasing the equipment or purchase the equipment under the guidelines set forth in the purchase option granted to the customer. Our end of term department seeks to realize our recorded residual in the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Corporation, MBB and our other subsidiaries are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on us and our subsidiaries and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.

 Although most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment lease financing business, certain states require lenders and finance companies to be licensed, impose limitations on certain contract terms and on interest rates and other charges, mandate disclosure of certain contract terms and constrain collection practices and remedies. In addition to state licensing requirements, we are required to comply with various laws and requirements that protect credit applicants or are otherwise applicable to financial institutions, including but not limited to the following: 
 

 | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that requires financial institutions to maintain privacy regarding credit application data in our possession and to periodically communicate with certain customers on privacy matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | USA Patriot Act of 2001, that requires financial institutions, including our banking subsidiary, to assist in the prevention, detection and prosecution of money laundering and the financing of terrorism;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which protects from unwanted auto-dialed or pre-recorded telemarketing calls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) requires financial institutions to establish a written program to implement Red Flag Guidelines, which are intended to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. The FACT Act also provides guidance regarding reasonable policies and procedures that a user of consumer credit reports must employ when a consumer reporting agency sends the user a notice of address discrepancy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of certain credit applicants; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics in the extension of credit and require that we provide notice to credit applicants of their right to receive a written statement of reasons for declined credit applications.

 Our insurance operations are subject to various types of governmental regulation. Our wholly-owned insurance company subsidiary, AssuranceOne, is a Class 3 Bermuda insurance company and, as such, is subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978, as amended, and related regulations. 
 Banking Regulation. 
 Our subsidiary, Marlin Business Bank, is a Utah state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank and is supervised by both the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (the Department). We are a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. We elected to become a financial holding company (while remaining a bank holding company) and the Bank Holding Company Act, as modified by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, permits us to engage in a wider range of financial activities deemed to be financial in nature including lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities, providing financial, investment or economic advisory services and underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities. Our status as a financial holding company permits the Company to conduct reinsurance activities through our AssuranceOne subsidiary. 
 Federal law provides the federal banking regulators, including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board, with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. 
 Federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the payment of dividends, the timing of the 
 
-12- 


  availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress could have a material adverse impact on our operations.
 Capital Adequacy. 
 The Company and MBB operate under the Basel III capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies effective on January 1, 2015, as modified by certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that became fully effective on January 1, 2019. Under the risk-based capital requirements applicable to them, bank holding companies must maintain a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including the asset equivalent of certain off-balance sheet activities such as acceptances and letters of credit) of not less than 8% (10% in order to be considered well-capitalized). The requirements include a 6% minimum Tier 1 risk-based ratio (8% to be considered well-capitalized). Tier 1 Capital consists of common stock, related surplus, retained earnings, qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of certain consolidated subsidiaries, after deducting goodwill and certain other intangibles. The remainder of total capital (Tier 2 Capital) may consist of certain perpetual debt securities, mandatory convertible debt securities, hybrid capital instruments and limited amounts of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures and unrealized gains on equity securities. At December 31, 2019, the Companys Tier 1 Capital and total capital ratios were 18.73% and 19.99%, respectively. 
 The capital standards require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The capital requirements also now require a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio with a required minimum of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered well-capitalized). The Federal Reserve Boards guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio (i.e., after deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. MBB is subject to similar capital standards. At December 31, 2019, the Companys leverage and common equity ratios were 16.31% and 18.73%, respectively. 
 The Company is required to have a level of regulatory capital in excess of the regulatory minimum and to have a capital buffer above 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. If a banking organization does not maintain capital above the minimum plus the capital conservation buffer it may be subject to restrictions on dividends, share buybacks, and certain discretionary payments such as bonus payments. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires federal regulators to take prompt corrective action against any undercapitalized institution. Five capital categories have been established under federal banking regulations: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Well-capitalized institutions significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Adequately capitalized institutions include depository institutions that meet but do not significantly exceed the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. Undercapitalized institutions consist of those that fail to meet the required minimum level for one or more relevant capital measures. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions consist of those with 
 
-13- 


  capital levels significantly below the minimum requirements for any relevant capital measure. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are those with minimal capital and at serious risk for government seizure. 
 Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Institutions that are adequately capitalized but not well-capitalized cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. 
 The federal bank regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institutions capital, the agencys corrective powers include, among other things: 
 

 | prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan and such a plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the banking institutions holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institutions holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. MBBs Tier 1 Capital balance was $147.8 million at December 31, 2019, resulting in a Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk based ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.91%, 15.47%, 15.47% and 16.73%, respectively, which exceeded the regulatory requirements for well-capitalized status of 5%, 6.5%, 8% and 10%, respectively. 
 Pursuant to the FDIC Agreement entered into in conjunction with the opening of MBB, MBB must keep its total risk-based capital ratio above 15%. MBBs total risk-based capital ratio of 16.73% at December 31, 2019 exceeded the threshold for well-capitalized status under the applicable laws and regulations, and also exceeded the 15% minimum total risk-based capital ratio required in the FDIC Agreement. 
 The federal banking agencies final regulatory capital rules, discussed above, also modify the above prompt corrective action requirements to add a common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio requirement, and increase certain other capital requirements for the various prompt corrective action thresholds. For example, the requirements for a bank to be considered well-capitalized under the rules are a 5.0% tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% common equity tier 1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, those ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance. 
 The deposits of MBB are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF) and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. The Dodd-Frank Act increased deposit insurance on most accounts to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions. 
 
-14- 


 The FDICs risk-based premium system for FDIC deposit insurance is governed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, as amended by certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC changed its risk-based premium system for FDIC deposit insurance which now includes quarterly assessments of FDIC-insured institutions based on their respective rankings in one of four risk categories depending upon their examination ratings and capital ratios. The FDIC capital assessment base now includes consolidated total assets minus tangible equity capital, defined as Tier 1 Capital. Institutions in FDIC-assigned Risk Categories II, III and IV are assessed premiums at progressively higher rates. 
 The Dodd Frank Act raised the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions). Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. When the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small banks credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment. If the reserve ratio exceeds 1.5%, the FDIC must dividend to DIF members the amount above the amount necessary to maintain the DIF at 1.5%, but the FDIC Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, suspend or limit the declaration of payment of dividends. 
 Source of Strength Doctrine. 
 Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as Federal Reserve Board policy and regulation, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and is expected to stand prepared to commit resources to support each of them. Consistent with this policy, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 
Future Legislation. 
 From time to time, legislation will be introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions. These proposals could substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates and financial product offerings and disclosures, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, if enacted, or any regulations issued to implement it, would have on the Company or MBB. 
National Monetary Policy. 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of the Company and MBB are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
 The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our future business, earnings and growth cannot be predicted. 
 
-15- 


 Dividends. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued policy statements which provide that, as a general matter, insured banks and bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. For state-chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System, such as MBB, the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for the payment of dividends by the bank subsidiary in any calendar year if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in that calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the current years net income combined with the retained net income for the two preceding calendar years. Retained net income for any period means the net income for that period less any common or preferred stock dividends declared in that period. Moreover, no dividends may be paid by such bank in excess of its undivided profits account. 
 Transfers of Funds and Transactions with Affiliates. 
 Regulations governing the Company and its affiliates, including sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, impose restrictions on MBB that limit the transfer of funds by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. and certain of its affiliates, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments or purchases of assets. These transfers by MBB to Marlin Business Services Corp. or any other single affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of MBBs capital and surplus, and transfers to all affiliates are limited in the aggregate to 20% of MBBs capital and surplus. These loans and extensions of credit are also subject to various collateral requirements. These regulations also require generally that MBBs transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to MBB than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. 
 Restrictions on Ownership. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the FDIC has been notified 60 days prior to such acquisition and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption in the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, such as the Company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging this rebuttable control presumption. 
 We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all material statutes and regulations that are applicable to our business. See further discussion of our risks related to regulation and capital requirements within  Risk Factors under Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.Competition 
 We compete with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to small and mid-sized businesses, including: 
 

 | national, regional and local banks and finance companies that provide leases and loan products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
