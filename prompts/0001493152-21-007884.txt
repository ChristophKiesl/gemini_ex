ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report, references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Big Cypress Acquisition Corp.
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 12, 2020. We were for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as target businesses. We have not selected any specific target business and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any target business regarding an initial business combination with our company. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on our management team’s differentiated ability to source, acquire and manage a business in the life sciences industry.
 
In November 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,156,250 founder shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.012 per share, to our sponsor, Big Cypress Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”).
 
On December 7, 2020, the Sponsor forfeited 161,719 founder shares to the Company and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. (“Ladenburg”) and certain of its employees purchased from the Company an aggregate of 161,719 representative shares at an average purchase price of approximately $0.012 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,875.
 
On January 3, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 1/3 of a share of common stock for every share of common stock outstanding, resulting in an aggregate of 2,875,000 founder shares outstanding (including up to 375,000 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part). On January 4, 2021, our Sponsor forfeited 28,750 founder shares to us and Ladenburg and certain of its employees purchased from us an aggregate of 28,750 representative shares at an average purchase price of approximately $0.008 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $230.00.
 
On January 14, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 11,500,000 of our units (the “Public Units”) which included Public Units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, which option was exercised in full. Each Public Unit consists of one share of common stock and one-half redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”). The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 417,200 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit with each Private Unit consisting of one share of common stock and one-half redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Warrants”), generating total proceeds of $4,172,000. The Private Units were sold to the Sponsor and Ladenburg. The Private Units and Private Warrants are identical to the Public Units and Public Warrants sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.
 
Following the closing of the IPO and the sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $6,038,360 consisting of $1,529,500 of underwriting fee, $4,220,500 of deferred underwriting fee, and $288,360 of other offering costs. In addition, $1,216,731 of cash was held outside of the trust account established in connection with the IPO, which is available for the payment of offering costs and for working capital purposes.
 
As a result of the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option in full, 375,000 of the founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
