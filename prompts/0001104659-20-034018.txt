ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“CASI” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CASI) is a U.S. biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics and pharmaceutical products with a product portfolio that includes approved and investigational assets.  In August 2019, the Company launched its first commercial product, EVOMELA® (Melphalan for Injection), in China that is approved for use as a conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation in the multiple myeloma setting. The Company’s other core hematology/oncology assets in its pipeline include (i) an autologous CD19 CAR-T investigative product (CNCT19) being developed as a treatment for patients with B-ALL and B-NHL; (ii) CID-103, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma; and (iii) greater China rights to ZEVALIN® (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan), a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody, that is approved in the U.S. to treat patients with NHL. The Company’s oncology assets also include China rights to (i) octreotide long acting injectable (LAI) microsphere formulation indicated for the treatment of certain symptoms associated with particular neuroendocrine cancers and acromegaly, and (ii) a novel formulation of thiotepa, which has multiple indications and a long history of established use in the hematology/oncology setting, both of which are being developed for import registration and market approval in China. The Company has established and continues to expand its operational expertise and execution capability as it further enhances its product and pipeline portfolio.
 
We believe our product mix reflects a risk-balanced approach between products in various stages of development, between products that are innovative, proprietary and generic, with a greater emphasis on innovative therapeutics. We intend to continue to pursue building a robust pipeline of drug candidates for development and commercialization in China as our primary market, and if rights are available for the rest of the world.
 
We believe the China operations offer a significant market and growth potential due to the extraordinary increase in demand for high quality medicine coupled with regulatory reforms in China that facilitate the entry of new pharmaceutical products into the country. We will continue to in-license clinical-stage and late-stage drug candidates, and leverage our cross-border operations and expertise, and hope to be the partner of choice to provide access to the China market. We expect the implementation of our plans will include leveraging our resources and expertise in both the U.S. and China so that we can maximize regulatory, development and clinical strategies in both countries.
 
The Company’s EVOMELA, ZEVALIN and MARQIBO® assets were originally licensed from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum”) and the Company had supply agreements with Spectrum to support the Company’s application for import drug registration and for commercialization purposes. On March 1, 2019, Spectrum completed the sale of its portfolio of FDA-approved hematology/oncology products including EVOMELA, ZEVALIN and MARQIBO to Acrotech Biopharma L.L.C. (“Acrotech”). The original supply agreements with Spectrum were assumed by Acrotech; Spectrum agreed to continue with a short-term supply agreement for EVOMELA for the initial commercial product supply in connection with the Company’s launch, with the long-term supply assumed by Acrotech.
 
As part of the long-term strategy to support our future clinical and commercial manufacturing needs and to manage our supply chain for certain products, on December 26, 2018, we established CASI Pharmaceuticals (Wuxi) Co., Ltd. (“CASI Wuxi”) to develop a future manufacturing facility in China to be located in the Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone in Jiangsu Province, China. The site is currently in the design and engineering phase.
 
Since its inception in 1991, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations and, as of December 31, 2019, has incurred an accumulated deficit of $523.9 million. In 2012, the Company shifted its business strategy to China and has since built an infrastructure in China that includes sales and marketing, medical affairs, and regulatory and clinical development. In 2014, the Company changed its name to “CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” The majority of the Company’s operations are now located in China. The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to, among other factors, its continuing clinical and development activities. Our operations in China are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CASI Pharmaceuticals (China) Co., Ltd. (“CASI China”), which is located in Beijing, China. Through CASI China, we will focus on the China market devoting more resources and investment going forward.

Taking into consideration the cash balance as of December 31, 2019, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund its operations at least through March 16, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a cash balance of $53.6 million of which approximately $2.6 million was held by CASI China, and approximately $22.1 million was held by CASI Wuxi. The Company intends to continue to exercise tight controls over operating expenditures and will continue to pursue opportunities, as required, to raise additional capital and will also actively pursue non- or less-dilutive capital raising arrangements.
 
CORE PRODUCT AND CANDIDATES IN HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY
 
EVOMELA® (Melphalan for Injection) - Launched In China



EVOMELA (Melphalan for Injection) is an intravenous formulation of melphalan commercialized by Acrotech (formally by Spectrum) in the multiple myeloma treatment setting in the United States. The EVOMELA formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which is used as a co-solvent in other formulations of melphalan. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan in EVOMELA allows for greater stability when reconstituted, allowing for longer preparation and infusion times. In August 2019, CASI launched EVOMELA in China as its first commercial product. The Company is also preparing for a post-marketing study required as part of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) marketing approval.

CNCT19 (CD19 CAR-T). CNCT19 targets CD19, a B-cell surface protein widely expressed during all phases of B-cell development and a validated target for B-cell driven hematological malignancies. CD19-targeted CAR constructs from several different institutions have demonstrated consistently high antitumor efficacy in children and adults with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). In June 2019, the Company acquired exclusive worldwide license and commercialization rights to CNCT19 from Juventas Cell Therapy Ltd. (“Juventas), a China-based domestic company engaged in cell therapy. Juventas will continue to be responsible for the clinical development and regulatory submission and maintenance of CNCT19 regulatory applications, with CASI’s participation on the joint steering committee. CASI will be responsible for the launch and commercialization of CNCT19 and for the payment of certain future development milestones and sales royalties. The China NMPA has approved the clinical trial applications for CNCT19 in Phase 1 studies in B-NHL and B-ALL. Juventas is making preparations for the trials and the Company expects that the dosing of the first patient will occur during 2020.
 
CID-103 (anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). CID-103 is a novel investigational anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Preclinical data demonstrate CID-103 to have enhanced activity against a broad array of malignancies which express CD38 and potentially better safety and best in class when compared to other CD38 monoclonal antibodies. In April 2019, the Company acquired exclusive worldwide rights to CID-103 from Black Belt Therapeutics Limited, which had previously obtained the program from Tusk Therapeutics Ltd. CID-103 is at the IND/IMPD submission stage of development, with a Phase 1 study targeted to start in the United Kingdom during 2020. CASI is responsible for all development and commercialization activities of the CID-103 program.
 
ZEVALIN® (Ibritumomab Tiuxetan). As part of our license transaction with Spectrum pursuant to which we acquired greater China rights to core product EVOMELA, we also acquired the greater China rights to FDA-approved ZEVALIN. ZEVALIN is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab, and Yttrium-90 (Y-90) a beta-emitting radioisotope. On February 12, 2019 the Company received NMPA’s approval of the Company’s Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to allow for a confirmatory registration trial to evaluate the drug’s efficacy and safety. We intend to advance the development, import drug registration, and market approval of ZEVALIN in China and currently is in the planning/execution stage for the registration study.
Thiotepa. The Company has exclusive China license and distribution rights to a novel formulation of thiotepa, a chemotherapeutic agent, which has multiple indications including use as a conditioning treatment for use prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Thiotepa has a long history of established use in the hematology/oncology setting. CASI intends to advance the development, import drug registration, and market approval of this product in China. The Company expects the clinical development program to begin during 2020.

OTHER ONCOLOGY ASSETS
 
Octreotide LAI. Octreotide LAI formulations are considered a standard of care for the treatment of acromegaly and for the control of symptoms associated with certain neuroendocrine tumors. In October 2019, the Company acquired exclusive China development and distribution rights for Octreotide LAI from Pharmathen Global BV. Octreotide LAI has been approved in various European countries. CASI intends to advance the development, import drug registration, and market approval of this product in China. The Company expects the clinical development program to begin during 2020.
 
ANDAs. In January 2018, the Company acquired a portfolio of 25 U.S. FDA-approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), one ANDA that FDA tentatively approved, and three ANDAs that are pending FDA approval. In October 2018, the Company acquired an additional ANDA for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In late 2018, the Chinese government announced and rolled out new drug pricing reforms, the so-called “4+7” volume-based drug procurement and tenders’ scheme. The drug pricing reform is more conducive to the international pharmaceutical companies. It primarily impacts the volume-based drug procurement in the Chinese local market and did not affect the ANDA’s global pricing. In 2019, the Company delisted 7 ANDAs to match the Company’s strategic development. For the rest of the held ANDAs, the Company’s primary focus is the global market. As a result, the Company assessed that the “4+7” pilot program will have a limited impact on the potential pricing of the ANDA drugs in the China local market.
 
MARQIBO (Vincristine Sulfate Liposome Injection). As part of our license transaction with Spectrum pursuant to which we acquired greater China rights to our core product EVOMELA, we also acquired the greater China rights to MARQIBO. MARQIBO is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, formulation of vincristine sulfate, a microtubule inhibitor, approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. In March 2019, the Company received NMPA’s approval of the Company’s Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to allow for a trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety. However, due to the evolving standard of care environment, the rare and niche indication for this product, and our commitment to prioritize resources for our other programs, the Company considers this product to be non-core and is currently evaluating its options for this product.
CASI WUXI
 
On December 26, 2018, the Company, together with Wuxi Jintou Huicun Investment Enterprise, a limited partnership organized under Chinese law (“Wuxi LP”) established CASI Wuxi to build and operate a manufacturing facility in the Wuxi Huishan Economic Development Zone in Jiangsu Province, China. The Company holds 80% of the equity interests in CASI Wuxi and Wuxi LP holds 20%.
 
In November 2019, CASI Wuxi entered into a lease agreement for the right to use state-owned land in China for the construction of a manufacturing facility. Pursuant to the agreement, CASI Wuxi has committed to invest land use right and property, plant and equipment of RMB1 billion (equivalent to US$ 143 million) within three years from the date of establishment of CASI Wuxi. The timing of the development and investment plans are subject to further discussion with the government. The Company is currently in the design and engineering phase for the facility and assessing the construction plan and timeline.
 
business Development 
 
CASI has built a fully integrated, world class biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the successful development and commercialization of innovative and other therapeutic products. 
 
Our current external business development effort is concentrated on acquiring additional drug candidates through in-license and acquisitions to expand our pipeline. We intend for our pipeline to reflect a diversified and risk-balanced set of assets that include (1) late-stage clinical drug candidates in-licensed for China regional rights, (2) proprietary or licensed innovative drug candidates, and (3) select high quality pharmaceuticals that fit our therapeutic focus. We use a market-oriented approach to identify pharmaceutical candidates that we believe have the potential for gaining widespread market acceptance, either globally or in China, and for which development can be accelerated under our global drug development strategy. Although oncology with a focus on hematological malignancies is our principal clinical and commercial target, we are opportunistic about other therapeutic areas that can address unmet medical needs.

RELATIONSHIPS RELATING TO PROGRAMS
 
Contract Manufacturing for EVOMELA. Established relationships, coupled with supply agreements, have secured the necessary resources to supply clinical materials for our clinical development program and to supply commercial inventory for EVOMELA. As an import product into China, we expect that future supply of EVOMELA will be continue to be met by our partner Acrotech and its contract manufacturers.
 
China Distributor for EVOMELA. On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into a three-year exclusive distribution agreement with China Resources Guokang Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd (“CRGK”) to appoint CRGK on an exclusive basis as its distributor to distribute EVOMELA in the territory of the People’s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), subject to certain terms and conditions. The Company’s internal marketing and sales team will continue to be responsible for commercial activities, including, for example, direct interaction with Key Opinion Leaders (KOL), physicians, hospital centers and the generating of sales.
 
Contract Manufacturing for ZEVALIN and MARQIBO. As import products into China, we expect that any clinical trial materials or commercial supply needed will similarly be supplied by our partner Acrotech and its contract manufacturers. With regard to Marqibo, the Company is currently evaluating its development strategy and options in light of an evolving standard of care for the niche indication and our commitment to prioritize resources for our other programs.
 
For CNCT19, under our license agreement with Juventas, Juventas continues to be responsible for the clinical development and regulatory submission of CNCT19, including the phase 1 trials, as well as responsible for manufacturing and supplying CASI with the future commercial supply of CNCT19. The Company will be responsible for the launch and commercialization of CNCT19. As CASI has an established sales and marketing team in the hematology oncology therapeutic area, we expect that the Company’s internal marketing and sales team will directly be responsible for CNCT19 commercial activities, including, for example, direct interaction with physicians, hospital centers and the generation of sales.
 
For CID-103, the Company is responsible for all development and commercialization activities of the CID-103 program. We expect that our clinical materials and commercial inventory will be supplied by one or more contract manufacturers with whom we are in current discussions.
 
For Octreotide LAI, under our agreement with Pharmathen Global BV (“Pharmathen”), Pharmathen will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying CASI with clinical materials and commercial inventory.
 
For Thiotepa, under our agreement with Riemser Pharma GmbH (“Riemser”), Riemser will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying CASI with clinical materials and commercial inventory.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States, Canada, China and other key markets.  The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.  Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can: (i) obtain patents to protect our own products; (ii) obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents; (iii) protect our trade secrets and know-how; and (iv) operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
 
With regards to our in-licensed drug EVOMELA, and drug candidates ZEVALIN and MARQIBO, we have acquired exclusive licenses to intellectual property to enable us to develop and commercialize the drug candidates in our greater China commercial markets.
 
6

 

With regards to our in-licensed anti-CD38 antibody candidate CID-103, we have acquired an exclusive license to patents around CID-103 and other anti-CD38 antibodies. This license covers 50 pending applications worldwide, directed to the antibodies themselves and treatment methods using the antibodies. The pending applications includes 5 pending USA patent applications, and 5 corresponding pending applications in each of Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Singapore.   We intend to further expand our patent portfolio and in the submission stage of additional applications.
 
The patent term for any patents granted from the earliest of these pending applications will expire in June 2038, assuming all annuities are paid and not considering any term extensions for regulatory approval that might be available.
 
With regards to our drug candidates Octreotide LAI and Thiotepa, we have acquired exclusive licenses to intellectual property and the know-how to enable us to develop and commercialize the drug candidates in the China market.
 
With regards to our proprietary ENMD-2076, for which we have discontinued development, we maintain a patent portfolio that includes 22 granted patents or allowed patent applications with patent term for U.S. Patent No. 7,563,787 expiring on March 5, 2027, and the patent terms of our granted patents in other countries expiring on September 29, 2026, assuming all maintenance fees and annuities are paid. Although we have discontinued development of ENMD-2076 in order to prioritized other aspects of our pipeline, such as our hematology oncology assets, our intellectual property for ENMD-2076 remains available for business development partnering.
 
We have pending trademark applications for CASI and CASI PHARMACEUTICALS.
 
We review and assess our portfolio on a regular basis to secure protection and to align our patent strategy with our overall business strategy. 
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 
Our research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, sale, marketing, advertising, and distribution of therapeutics in the United States, China and other countries are subject to extensive regulations by federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates the development and commercialization of drugs and biologics. Drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and biological products, in addition to being subject to certain provisions of the FFDCA, are regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We believe that the FDA will regulate the products currently being developed by us or our collaborators as drugs or biologics. Both the FFDCA and PHSA and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and other promotion of biologics and drugs, as the case may be.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Preparing drug and biologic candidates for regulatory approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, a developer first must conduct preclinical studies in the laboratory and in animal model systems in accordance with applicable FDA requirements, including Good Laboratory Practice regulations, to gain preliminary information on an agent's effectiveness and to identify any safety problems. The results of these studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as protocols and detailed descriptions for proposed clinical investigations, are submitted to FDA as a part of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a drug or biologic, which must become effective before human clinical trials of an investigational drug can begin. An IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND application, and places the clinical trial(s) on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND application sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be certain that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
 
7

 

We or our collaborators must then conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), and other clinical-trial related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the candidate for each proposed indication We or our collaborators will be required to select qualified investigators (usually physicians within medical institutions) to supervise the administration of the products, test or otherwise assess patient results, and collect and maintain patient data; monitor the investigations to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with applicable requirements, including the requirements set forth in the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND; and comply with applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board (“IRB”) for each institution where the trials will be conducted before the trial can begin, and each IRB must monitor the study until completion. Study subjects must provide informed consent and sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial.
 
Clinical trials of drugs or biologics are normally done in three phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational candidate into humans to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 trials normally involve trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the candidate for specific target indications. Phase 3 trials are expanded clinical trials with larger numbers of patients which are intended to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to gather additional information for proper dosage and labeling of the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials may take several years to complete. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. We or our collaborators, the FDA, or an IRB (with respect to a particular study site) may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after receiving initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of the product or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.
 
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and, for regenerative medicine therapies, regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development, and FDA’s review, of drugs and biologics (e.g., granting approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints subject to post-approval trials). Generally, drugs or biologics that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs for those disease or conditions, and/or those that provide a meaningful benefit over existing treatments. Moreover, if a sponsor submits a marketing application for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat, and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent application. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, these programs do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 
8

 

If clinical trials of a product candidate are completed successfully, the sponsor of the product may seek FDA marketing approval. If the product is classified as a new drug, an applicant must file a New Drug Application (NDA). For biological products, an applicant must file a Biologics License Application (BLA). In each case, FDA must approve the application before the product can be marketed commercially. NDAs and BLAs must include, among other things, detailed information about the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling and the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of a drug, and safety, purity, and potency of a biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. A user fee must be paid with the submission of an NDA or BLA (unless a fee waiver applies) in order to support the cost of agency review, which is currently almost $3 million. FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing and production and testing facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. In addition, FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites that generated data for the NDA or BLA as well as us or our collaborators as a clinical trial sponsor.
 
The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that FDA will accept the application for filing or that any approval will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has ten months from the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant. However, the time required by the FDA to review and approve NDAs and BLAs is variable and, to a large extent, beyond our control. Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data, the FDA may ultimately decide that an NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria and deny the approval. In such instance, FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter, describing all the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in an application that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Further, even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but the Agency historically has tended to follow such recommendations. In addition, the FDA may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that may include both special labeling and controls, known as Elements to Assure Safe Use, on the distribution, prescribing, dispensing and use of a drug product. After approval is obtained, a marketed product is subject to continuing regulatory requirements and review relating to cGMP, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, and other matters. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label. Discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product, mandated labeling changes, or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 
Drugs and biological products may be eligible to receive certain regulatory exclusivities upon approval. For example, a drug that constitutes a new chemical entity (i.e., an active moiety that has not been previously approved in another NDA) is entitled to five years of exclusivity during which FDA may not accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for filing referencing such chemical entity, unless a “Paragraph IV certification” is made in which case FDA may accept such applications four years after initial approval of the new chemical entity. In addition, three years of exclusivity can be awarded for applications (including supplements) containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted by the applicant and essential to the FDA’s approval of new versions or conditions of use of previously approved drug products, such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or other conditions of use. A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. Moreover, a drug or biologic may receive orphan drug designation if intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which restricts FDA from approving any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of an inability to assure drug supply.

FDA may approve generic drugs and biological products through abbreviated pathways. Generic drugs may be marketed upon approval of an ANDA, which contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved drug. Approval is generally supported by data from bioequivalence studies, rather than complete preclinical and clinical studies. Biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product are eligible for an abbreviated approval pathway. Although licensure of biosimilar or interchangeable products is generally expected to require less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for reference products, the FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability. Under section 610 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, entitled “Actions for Delays of Generic Drugs and Biological Products”, generic drug and biosimilar developers may sue brand manufacturers, or generic or biosimilar manufacturers, to obtain sufficient quantities of reference product necessary for approval of the developers’ generic or biosimilar product. If a generic drug or biosimilar developer is successful in its suit, the defendant manufacturer would be required to provide sufficient quantities of product on commercially-reasonable, market-based terms and may be required to pay the developer’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as well as financial compensation under certain circumstances. While intended to facilitate the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar products, we cannot determine what effect this new private right of action may have on the development and approval of generic drug and biosimilar products at this time.
 
The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 establishes penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an application. In general, the FDA is authorized to temporarily or permanently bar companies and individuals, from submitting or assisting in the submission of applications to FDA, and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market drugs under certain circumstances. FDA’s debarment authority has also been expanded to apply to certain import-related offenses. In addition to debarment, the FDA has numerous enforcement and disciplinary powers, including the authority to withdraw approval of an application or to approve an application under certain circumstances, to suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct, and various civil and criminal penalties. The FDA may also withdraw product approval or take other corrective measures if, among other things, ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
 
Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 
Healthcare Regulation
 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.

Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
 
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA), created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 
For those marketed products which are covered in the United States by certain government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.
 
National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, formerly the China Food and Drug Administration)
 
In the PRC, the NMPA is the authority under the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) that monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceuticals products, medical appliances and equipment, and cosmetics. We are also subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug administration in China. For clinical-stage product candidates, our development activities in China can follow two purposes: (1) to obtain clinical data to support our global FDA-regulated trials as is the case for our proprietary ENMD-2076, and (2) to obtain clinical data to support local registration with the NMPA. For late-stage product candidates that we in-license for greater China rights, such as EVOMELA, which has been launched, ZEVALIN and MARQIBO, our development activities in China are to secure marketing approval from NMPA by conducting import drug registration. The “Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals,” as last amended on August 26, 2019, provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products in China. The newly amended Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals became effective on December 1, 2019.
 
11

 

We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to manufacturers and distributors in general.
 
The Marketing Authorization Holder System. Pursuant to the newly amended Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals, the Marketing Authorization Holder System, previously implemented in a few pilot regions in China, is now implemented nationwide. Companies and research and development institutions can be drug marketing authorization holders after they receive drug approvals. The drug marketing authorization holder are responsible for their products throughout the life cycle, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, production and distribution, post-market studies, and the monitoring, reporting, and handling of adverse reactions in connection with pharmaceuticals in accordance with the newly amended law. 
 
The marketing authorization holders may engage contract manufacturers for manufacturing, provided that the contract manufacturers are licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers, and may engage pharmaceutical distribution enterprises with a valid drug distribution license to sell their products. Upon receiving the marketing authorizations from the NMPA, a drug marketing authorization holder may transfer its drug marketing authorization and the transferee should have the capability of quality management, risk prevention and control, and liability compensation to ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality controllability of drugs, and fulfill the obligations of the drug marketing authorization holder.
 
Product Manufacturing. For the registration of locally manufactured drugs, both drug substance and drug product need to be manufactured in China through either a self-owned facility or a contract manufacturing organization. The study drug to be used for clinical trials must be manufactured in compliance with NMPA Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. A domestic manufacturer of pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) must obtain the drug manufacturing license and the drug/API registration approval to produce pharmaceutical products and API for marketing in China. Pursuant to the newly amended Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals, the GMP certification has been cancelled, but with its cancellation, drug manufacturing enterprises are still required to strictly comply with GMP requirements. GMP requirements include institution and staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, hygiene conditions, production management, quality controls, product distributions, maintenance of records and manner of handling customer complaints and adverse reaction reports. The drug manufacturing license is valid for five years, and must be renewed at least six months before its expiration date.
 
In addition, before commencing business, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must also obtain a business license from the Administration of Market Regulation at the local level.
 
Preclinical Research and Clinical Trials. For an investigational new drug application, a clinical trial approval issued from the NMPA was historically required to conduct clinical trials. However, since July 24, 2018, the NMPA announced to adopt a negative notification system for clinical trial approvals. In particular, if the applicant does not receive negative comments within 60 days after the CDE accepts the clinical trial application, the applicant can proceed with the clinical trial immediately based on the protocol submitted without the need for obtaining a clinical trial approval. Chemical generics, on the other hand, only need to undergo bioequivalent studies upon a filing for record with the NMPA. In order to apply for a clinical trial application approval to support local registration in China, a pharmaceutical company is required to conduct a series of preclinical research including research on chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetics of pharmaceuticals. This preclinical research should be conducted in compliance with the relevant regulatory guidelines issued by the NMPA. In particular, safety evaluation research must be conducted in compliance with China’s Good Laboratory Practice.
 
After completion of preclinical studies and obtaining permission to conduct the clinical trial from the NMPA, clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials, and Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted at the post-marketing surveillance stage, in compliance with China’s Good Clinical Practice:
 
Phase 1 – preliminary trial of clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. The primary objective is to observe the pharmacokinetics and the tolerance level of the human body to the new medicine as a basis for ascertaining the appropriate methods of dosage.
 
12

 

Phase 2 – preliminary exploration on the therapeutic efficacy. The purpose is to assess preliminarily the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients with the target indication of the pharmaceutical products and to provide the basis for the design and dosage tests for Phase 3. The dosing and methodology of research in this phase generally adopts double-blind, random methods with limited sample sizes.
Phase 3 – confirm the therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to further verify the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients within the target indication, to evaluate the benefits and risks and finally to provide sufficient experimentally proven evidence to support the registration application of the pharmaceutical products. In general, the trial should adopt double-blind random methods with sufficient sample sizes.
Phase 4 –assess therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions post-approval. The purpose is, by conducting a new drug’s post-marketing study, to assess therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions when the drug is widely used, to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug when used among the general population or specific groups and to adjust the administration dose, among others.
Collecting and Using Patients’ Biospecimens and Derived Data. Foreign-invested sponsors that collect and use patients’ biospecimens in clinical trials are required to file with the China Human Genetic Resources Administrative Office, or the HGRAO, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, or the MOST. In 2017, the MOST issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval for collecting and using human genetic resources for the purpose of commercializing a drug in the PRC. In June 2019, the State Council of PRC issued the Regulation on the Administration of PRC Human Genetic Resources, which formalized the approval requirements pertinent to research collaborations between Chinese and foreign-owned entities.
 
Pursuant to this new HGR Regulation, a new notification system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) was put in place for clinical trials using PRC patients’ biospecimens at clinical study sites without involving the export of such specimens outside of China. Under the new rule, a notification filing specifying the type, quantity and usage of the biospecimens, among others, with the HGRAO is required before conducting such clinical trials. The collection and use of PRC patients’ biospecimens in international collaboration in basic scientific research are still subject to the approval of the HGRAO.
 
Import Drug Registration or Multi Regional Clinical Trials. NMPA regulations allow foreign drug developers to conduct import drug registration or multi regional clinical trials in China for a new drug as part of a global drug development program. An International Multicenter Clinical Trial (IMCCT) Application needs to be filed with the NMPA and approval is required prior to conducting the trials.
 
In October, 2017, the NMPA released the Decision on Adjusting Items concerning the Administration of Imported Drug Registration, which includes the following key points:
 

· | If the International Multicenter Clinical Trial, or IMCCT, of a drug is conducted in China, the IMCCT drug does not need to be approved or entered into either a Phase II or III clinical trial in a foreign country, except for preventive biological products. Phase I IMCCT is permissible in China.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If the IMCCT is conducted in China, the application for drug marketing authorization can be submitted directly after the completion of the IMCCT.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | With respect to clinical trial and market authorization applications for imported innovative chemical drugs and therapeutic biological products, the marketing authorization in the country or region where the foreign drug manufacturer is located will not be required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | With respect to drug applications that have been accepted before the release of this Decision, if relevant requirements are met, importation permission can be granted if such applications request exemption of clinical trials for the imported drugs based on the data generated from IMCCT.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NMPA Decision on IMCCT and the application for imported new drugs is expected to streamline and accelerate the applications for imported new drugs.
 
In order to apply for an IMCCT Application in China, a biopharmaceutical company is required to submit a comprehensive investigation new drug application package filed with foreign regulatory agency, i.e. the FDA, in a format compliant with NMPA guidance.
 
After obtaining the IMCCT approval from the NMPA, clinical trials are conducted in compliance with the both FDA/ICH and NMPA Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
 
Data derived from IMCCT can be used for the New Drug Registration Applications with the NMPA. When using IMCCT data to support New Drug Registration Applications in China, applicants shall submit completed global clinical trial report, statistical analysis report and database, along with relevant supporting data in accordance with the ICH-CTD (International Conference on Harmonization-Common Technical Document) content and format requirements; subgroup research results summary and comparative analysis shall also be conducted concurrently.
 
New Drug Registration and Application. After completion of the first 3 phases of clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical in its targeted indication, a New Drug Registration Application needs to be filled with the NMPA, which includes research data of chemistry, manufacturing and controls, pre-clinical studies and clinical trial report. For imported drugs, the New Drug Registration Application is also known as the Import Drug License Application.
 
Once a new drug registration approval or import drug license is received, the product can be sold nationwide in China.
 
Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation. The NMPA has launched the generic quality consistency evaluation (GQCE) since 2013, which requires domestically-manufactured generic drugs to conform to the quality standards and therapeutic efficacy of originator products. In 2016, the Chinese regulatory authorities announced that imported generic drugs must also pass the GQCE in China. The GQCE generally required the manufacturers of generics to conduct bioequivalent studies (or dissolution tests) of a generic drug against a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug) in order to establish equivalence to the originator products. If there is no qualified reference drug, the generic manufacturer has to conduct a clinical efficacy trial.
 
The first wave of GQCE focuses on 289 oral formulations of chemical drugs listed in China’s Essential Drug List. The NMPA will reject to renew the marketing authorizations of these generic drugs if their manufacturers fail to complete the GQCE by the end of 2018 (or the end of 2021 if clinical efficacy trials are required). If the manufacturers can prove that the generics are products in shortage and clinically essential, they can apply for an extension up to 5 years in order to pass the GQCE. Once one generic manufacturer successfully passes the GQCE, all of the other manufacturers producing the same generic drug must complete their GQCE within three years following the first successful GQCE. Otherwise, the NMPA will not renew their respective marketing authorizations.
 
The launch of GQCE will significantly elevate of the bar of entry of generic manufacturers. Generics that pass the GQCE will be on a preferred list at public hospital tenders and will be entitled to a more favorable reimbursement status. Public hospitals will only be allowed to purchase from the first three generic manufacturers who pass the GQCE.
 
Pricing. The government regulates prices for pharmaceuticals (except for narcotic and Type 1 psychotropic drugs) mainly by establishing a price negotiation, consolidated procurement mechanism, and revising medical insurance reimbursement standards. The Chinese government has initiated several rounds of price negotiations with manufacturers of patented drugs, drugs with an exclusive source of supply, and oncology drugs since 2016. The average percentage of price reduction has been over 50%. Once the government agreed with the drug manufacturers on the supply prices, the drugs would be automatically listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and qualified for public hospital purchase.
Reimbursement. China is a single-payor market with near universal healthcare provided by the government. Up to 99% of the population receives healthcare coverage at various levels of reimbursement. Commercial insurance is available but is minimally adopted, and is seen as a supplement above and beyond government reimbursement. To obtain government reimbursement for a drug, the government must agree to add it to the NRDL or the provincial reimbursement drug lists at a negotiated price (at times at a significant discount to prevailing market price). Prior to this time, the market is self-pay, where patients will be responsible for 100% of the launch price determined by the company. We believe the self-pay market in China is expanding, given the rise in personal income levels in the country. The government has updated the NRDL in November 2019 to include 70 new drugs. Previous updates to the NRDL occurred in 2017 and 2009. In addition, there were also NRDL price negotiations in 2018 and 2019. Admission to the NRDL depends on a number of factors, including on-market experience, scale of patient adoption, physician endorsement, cost effectiveness and budget impact. Provincial governments have some discretion to add additional drugs not listed in the NDRL to provincial reimbursement drug lists.
 
14

 

Hospital Listing. Government hospitals currently represent over 90% of the pharmaceutical market in China. In order for a new drug to be prescribed at a government hospital, it has to be listed in the hospital formulary. The process of entering into the formulary is commonly referred to as “hospital listing”, and typically requires a long lead time. These decisions are made on a hospital-by-hospital basis with timing that can range from every six months to every five years. Some hospitals also have temporary listing procedures that can accelerate timing. Private hospital and non-hospital pharmacies, which represent less than 10% of the drug market in China, do not require a formulary process to sell a drug.
Centralized Procurement and Tenders. Provincial and municipal government agencies will establish a provincial drug procurement agency to operate a mandatory collective tender process for purchases by government hospitals of a medicine included in provincial or local medicine procurement catalogs. The provincial or local medicine procurement catalogs are determined by the provincial drug procurement agency based on the National Essential Drugs List, the NDRL, local hospital formularies, etc. If a new drug has been included in a government hospital formulary, the NDRL or the provincial reimbursement drug list, the relevant hospitals must participate in collective tender processes for the purchase of such new drug. During the collective tender process, the provincial drug procurement agency will establish a committee consisting of recognized pharmaceutical experts. The committee will assess the bids submitted by the various participating pharmaceutical manufacturers, taking into consideration, among other things, the quality and price of the drug product and the service and reputation of the manufacturer. Only drug products that have been selected in the collective tender processes may be purchased by participating hospitals.
 
“4+7” Volume-based Drug Procurement and Tenders. In June 2018, the State Council decided to launch a new round of drug pricing and procurement reform. The reform policy aims to lower drug costs for patients, reduce transaction costs for enterprises, regulate drug use of hospitals, and improve the centralized drug procurement and pricing system. This reform is implemented mainly by the National Healthcare Security Administration, or the NHSA, a new agency established in 2018 as part of the institutional restructuring with a mandate for pricing and procurement of drugs and medical disposables. The NHC supports the reform by introducing policy that encourages purchasing and prescribing of the selected drug. The NMPA is responsible for the quality assurance of the drugs submitted for tenders.
 
The national pilot scheme for centralized volume-based drug procurement and tenders under the reform was launched in November 2018. The selected drugs must pass the GQCE on quality and effectiveness.
 
The centralized volume-based procurement is open to all approved enterprises that manufacture drugs on the government-set procurement list in China. Based on published results in 2019, the procurement list rise to 33 generic drugs and was expanded to 25 provinces.
 
COMPETITION 
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries is intense and based significantly on scientific and technological factors, the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability and length of time required to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing and the ability to commercialize products in a timely fashion. Moreover, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology that could result in the technological obsolescence of any products that we develop.
 
15

 

We compete with many specialized biopharmaceutical firms, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in oncology will increase. Many biopharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area, including oncology and inflammation, and many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.
 
The biopharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively, we will be required to continually expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially viable opportunities.
 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our product candidates may be developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and complete the other requirements to get a pharmaceutical product on the market are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. We may rely on third parties to commercialize our products, and accordingly, the success of these products will depend in significant part on these third parties' efforts and ability to compete in these markets. The success of any collaboration will depend in part upon our collaborative partners' own competitive, marketing and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and marketed by our collaborative partners and our competitors.
 
Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. In addition, many of these competitors have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approvals. The existence of competitive products, including products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products that we may develop. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing our product candidates.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
Our work force currently consists of approximately 125 full-time employees, the majority of which are located in China. Certain of our activities, such as manufacturing and clinical trial operations, are outsourced at the present time. We may hire additional personnel, in addition to utilizing part-time or temporary consultants, on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
 
We were incorporated under Delaware law in 1991. In 2012, we refocused our clinical and regulatory strategy to leverage resources in China and implemented a name change in 2014 to “CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” Our offices are located at 9620 Medical Center Drive, Suite 300, Rockville, Maryland 20850, and our telephone number is (240) 864-2600. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, CASI China, is headquartered in Beijing, China. We conduct substantially all of our commercial, regulatory and related operations through CASI China. CASI China’s headquarters are located at 1701-1702, China Central Office Tower 1, No.81 Jianguo Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100025 China. We also lease office and laboratory space from a related party at 425 Eccles Ave South San Francisco, CA 94080. Management decisions are primarily being made out of CASI China where our executive team spends a substantial amount of time.

CHINA OPERATIONS
 
In August 2012, we established a wholly-owned China-based subsidiary and an office in Beijing, and in 2014, established a R&D Center in Beijing. We also established a wholly-owned domestic China based subsidiary under which our preclinical activities are operated. In addition, CASI Wuxi was established on December 26, 2018, to own and operate the Wuxi manufacturing facility. Our staff in China currently consists of approximately 110 full-time employees. Among its activities, our China operations help to oversee the Company’s sales and marketing of EVOMELA and the anticipated commercial activities of our pipeline products, technology transfer, local preclinical and clinical operation activities, as well as its NMPA regulatory activities. In addition, the Beijing operations include business development activities and executive management activities. We expect our operations in China to continue to grow.
