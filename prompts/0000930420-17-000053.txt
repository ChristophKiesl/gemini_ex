Item 1. Business.
Company Overview 
Kforce Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kforce”) provide professional and technical specialty staffing services and solutions to customers through the following segments: Technology (“Tech”), Finance and Accounting (“FA”), and Government Solutions (“GS”). Kforce provides flexible staffing services and solutions on both a temporary (“Flex”) and permanent (“Direct Hire”) basis. We operate through our corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida and 61 field offices located throughout the U.S., as well as an office in Manila, Philippines. Kforce was incorporated in 1994 but its predecessor companies, Romac & Associates, Inc. and Source Services Corporation have been providing staffing services since 1962. Kforce completed its Initial Public Offering in August 1995.
Kforce serves clients from the Fortune 1000, the Federal Government, state and local governments, local and regional companies and small to mid-sized companies. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 25% of revenues and no single customer accounted for more than 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from domestic operations with customers located in the U.S. and substantially all long-lived assets were located in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our international operations comprised approximately 1% of net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and are included in our Tech segment.
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of our customers’ businesses. Our reporting segments are significantly impacted by the increase in the number of holidays and vacation days taken during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. In addition, we experience an increase in direct costs of services and a corresponding decrease in gross profit in the first fiscal quarter of each year as a result of certain annual U.S. state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each year.
The following charts depict the percentage of our total revenues for each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (the chart for 2014 excludes our former Health Information Management (“HIM”) segment, which we sold in 2014):
For additional segment financial data see Note 13 – “Reportable Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Tech
Our Tech segment provides both temporary staffing and permanent placement services to our clients, focusing primarily on areas of information technology such as systems/applications architecture and development, project management, enterprise data management, business intelligence, e-commerce, technology infrastructure, network architecture and security. Revenues for our Tech segment decreased 1.4% to $883.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $895.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The average bill rate for our Tech segment for 2016 was approximately $67 per hour. Our Tech segment provides service to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in the financial services, communications, insurance services and government sectors. A September 2016 report published by Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) stated that temporary technology staffing is expected to experience growth of 6% in 2017. We believe the primary drivers of this growth and the continuing use of temporary staffing as a solution during uncertain economic cycles are the increasingly strict regulatory environment and cost of employment, both of which are driving the systemic use of temporary staffing, particularly in project-based work such as technology, and the increasing demand for talent in areas like cybersecurity, cloud-based computing, data analytics and application development. The secular drivers of technology spend have remained intact with many companies now becoming increasingly dependent on the efficiencies provided by technology and the need for innovation to support business strategies and sustain relevancy in today’s rapidly changing marketplace. The SIA report also provides that notable skill shortages in certain technology skill sets are expected to continue.
FA
Our FA segment provides both temporary staffing and permanent placement services to our clients in areas such as general accounting, business analysis, accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial analysis and reporting, taxation, budget preparation and analysis, mortgage and loan processing, cost analysis, professional administration, outsourced functional support, credit and collections, audit services, and systems and controls analysis and documentation. Our FA segment provides service to clients in a variety of industries with a strong footprint in the financial services, healthcare and government sectors. Revenues for our FA segment increased 3.6% to $337.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $325.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The average bill rate for our FA segment for 2016 was approximately $32 per hour. A September 2016 report published by SIA stated that finance and accounting staffing is expected to experience growth of 6% in 2017.
GS
Our GS segment provides staffing services and solutions to the Federal Government as both a prime contractor and a subcontractor in the fields of information technology and finance and accounting. The GS contracts are concentrated among customers that have historically been less likely to be impacted by sequestration threats and budget constraints, such as the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. GS offers integrated business solutions to its customers in areas such as: information technology, healthcare informatics, data and knowledge management, research and development, audit readiness, financial management and accounting, among other areas. Revenues for our GS segment increased 1.3% to $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our GS segment also includes a product-based business specialized in manufacturing and delivering trauma-training manikins, which accounted for approximately 16% of its total revenues in 2016. Substantially all GS services are supplied to the Federal Government through field offices located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, San Antonio, Texas and Austin, Texas. 
Types of Staffing Services
We target clients and recruits for both Flex and Direct Hire services, which contributes to our objective of providing integrated solutions for all of our clients’ human capital needs.

Flex
For each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Flex represented approximately 96% of total Kforce revenues, respectively. We provide our clients with qualified individuals (“consultants”) on a temporary basis when it is determined that they have the appropriate skills and experience and are the right match for our clients. We recruit consultants from the job boards, Kforce.com, social media networks and passive candidate marketing, where we identify individuals who are currently employed and not actively seeking another position. These consultants can be directly employed by Kforce, qualified independent contractors or foreign nationals sponsored by Kforce. Our success is dependent upon our internal employees’ (“associates”) ability to: (1) acknowledge, understand and participate in creating solutions for our clients’ needs; (2) determine and understand the capabilities of the consultants being recruited; and (3) deliver and manage the client-consultant relationship to the satisfaction of both our clients and our consultants. We believe proper execution by our associates and our consultants directly impacts the longevity of the assignments, increases the likelihood of being able to generate repeat business with our clients and fosters a better experience for our consultants, which has a direct correlation to their redeployment.
Flex revenues are driven by the number of total hours billed and pre-established bill rates. Flex gross profit is determined by deducting consultant pay, benefits and other related costs from Flex revenues. Associate commissions, related taxes and other compensation and benefits, as well as field management compensation are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), along with other customary costs such as administrative and corporate compensation. The Flex business model involves attempting to maximize the number of billable consultant hours and bill rates, while managing consultant pay rates and benefit costs, as well as compensation and benefits for our core associates. Flex revenues also includes revenues for our GS segment. These revenues involve providing longer-term contract services to the customer primarily on a time-and-materials basis.
Direct Hire
Our Direct Hire business is a significantly smaller, yet important, part of our business that involves locating qualified individuals (“candidates”) for permanent placement with our clients. We primarily perform these searches on a contingency basis; thus, fees are only earned if the candidates are ultimately hired by our clients. The typical fee structure is based upon a percentage of the placed individual’s annual compensation in their first year of employment, which is known or can be estimated at the time of placement. We recruit candidates using methods that are consistent with Flex consultants. Also, there are occasions where consultants are initially assigned to a client on a temporary basis and later are converted to a permanent placement, for which we may also receive a fee (referred to as “conversion revenue”). 
Direct Hire revenues are driven by placements made and the resulting fees billed and are recognized net of an allowance for “fallouts,” which occur when candidates do not complete the applicable contingency period. Although the contingency period can vary by contract, it is typically 90 days or less. There are no consultant payroll costs associated with Direct Hire placements, thus, all Direct Hire revenues increase gross profit by the full amount of the fee. Direct Hire associate commissions, compensation and benefits are included in SG&A.
Industry Overview
The specialty staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies, most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base. Based on a report published by SIA in 2016 regarding the largest staffing firms in the United States, we estimate Kforce is one of the 10 largest publicly-traded specialty staffing firms in the U.S. According to a report published by the SIA in June 2016, 134 companies reported at least $100 million in U.S. staffing revenues in 2015 and these companies represented an estimated 56.8% of the total market.

Based upon previous economic cycles experienced by Kforce, we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for additional U.S. workers and, conversely, an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional U.S. workers. From an economic standpoint, temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand, which continued to be positive during 2016, based on data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) and SIA. The penetration rate (the percentage of temporary staffing to total employment) in December 2016 was at 2.04%, a slight decline from the December 2015 high of 2.06%. While the health of the macro-employment picture was uncertain at times during 2016, it generally continuously improved, with the unemployment rate at 4.7% as of December 2016, and non-farm payroll expanding an average of approximately 180,000 jobs per month in 2016. Also, the college-level unemployment rate, which we believe serves as a proxy for professional employment and therefore aligns with the candidate and consultant population that Kforce serves, was at 2.5% in December 2016. Further, we believe that the unemployment rate in the specialties we serve, especially in certain technology skill sets, is lower than the published averages, which we believe speaks to the demand environment in which we are operating. Management believes that the tepid growth in the overall U.S. economy seen through much of 2016, the recent change in administration, and the increasing costs and government regulation of employment may be driving a secular shift to an increased use of temporary staff as a percentage of total workforce as employers may be reluctant to increase permanent hiring. If the penetration rate of temporary staffing experiences growth in the coming months and years, we believe our Flex revenues may grow even in a relatively modest growth macro-economic environment. Kforce remains optimistic about the growth prospects of the temporary staffing industry, the penetration rate, and in particular, our revenue portfolio; however, the economic environment includes considerable uncertainty and volatility and therefore no reliable predictions can be made about the general economy, the staffing industry as a whole, or specialty staffing in particular.
According to an industry forecast published by SIA in September 2016, the U.S. temporary staffing industry generated estimated revenues of $103.7 billion in 2013, $109.2 billion in 2014 and $115.7 billion in 2015, and has projected revenues of $120.0 billion in 2016 and $124.8 billion in 2017. Based on projected revenues of $120.0 billion for the U.S. temporary staffing industry, this would put the Firm’s overall market share at approximately 1%. Therefore, our business strategies are sharply focused around expanding our share of the U.S. temporary staffing market and further penetrating our existing clients’ staffing needs.
Business Strategies
Our primary goals are to enhance long-term shareholder value by achieving above-market revenue growth as compared to our peers in the segments in which we are focused, making prudent investments to enhance our operating model and efficiency and generating improved levels of operating profitability. We believe the following strategies will help us achieve our goals. 
Invest in Revenue-Generating Talent. We continue to focus on providing our talent with the necessary tools to be more effective and efficient in performing their roles and to better evaluate our business opportunities and allow us to elevate the value we are bringing to our clients and candidates. This includes enhancing our sales methodology and training our sales associates to engage in more strategic conversations and shape solutions with our clients. We completed the initial rollout of our sales transformation initiative in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will continue to make progress on ensuring it is fully engrained within the Firm. We also expect to enhance our delivery methodology and training of our delivery associates. This includes our national delivery team, which focuses on quality and speed of delivery services to our clients with demands for high volume staffing. Additionally, the Firm expects to continue to selectively hire and allocate revenue-generating talent in markets, products, industries and clients that present us with the greatest opportunity for profitable revenue growth. 
Enhanced Customer Focus. During 2016, Kforce consolidated our sales and delivery organization under a single leader, our Chief Operations Officer, and certain revenue-enabling support functions were realigned in an effort to allow us to more effectively compete for business, particularly with our largest customers. We believe the new alignment, coupled with the rebalancing of our sales and delivery talent through a disproportionate investment in sales talent, will enable us to allocate additional sales talent to provide exceptional service to our largest customers with whom we have long-term relationships. In order to achieve greater penetration within each of our largest accounts, we work to foster an understanding of our clients’ human capital needs holistically while building a consultative partnership rather than a transactional client relationship.
We strive to differentiate ourselves by working closely with our clients to understand their needs and maximize their return on human capital. Finding the right match for both our clients and consultants is our ultimate priority. The placement of our highly skilled consultants requires operational and technical skill to effectively recruit and evaluate personnel, match them to client needs, and manage the resulting relationships. We believe the proper placements of consultants with the right clients will serve to balance the desire for optimal volume, rate, effort and duration of assignment, while ultimately maximizing the benefit for our clients, consultants and the Firm. In addition, Kforce’s ability to offer flexible staffing solutions, coupled with our permanent placement capability, offers the client a broad spectrum of specialty staffing services.

Leverage Technology Infrastructure. We have made significant progress toward a rollout of our new customer relationship management system which incorporates our enhanced sales methodology to reinforce execution. This rollout is a major piece of a multi-year effort to replace and upgrade our technology tools to equip our talented associates with significantly improved capabilities to deliver exceptional service to our clients, enhance productivity and accelerate associate ramp-up. As we look into the future, we expect to continue improving our technology infrastructure and surrounding processes to generate additional operating leverage as we grow, enhance flexibility in meeting our clients' increasing needs and improve the effectiveness of our associates.
Retain our Great People. A significant focus of Kforce is on the retention of our tenured and top performing associates. We ended fiscal 2016 with a strong, streamlined management, revenue-generating, and revenue-enabling teams, which we believe will continue to enhance our ability to achieve future profitable growth.
We believe our consultants are a significant component in delivering value to our clients. We are focused on efficient and effective consultant care processes, such as onboarding, frequent and ongoing communication and programs to redeploy our consultants in a timely fashion. We strive to increase the tenure and loyalty of our consultants and be their “Employer of Choice,” thus enabling us to deliver the highest quality talent to our clients. Overall, Kforce’s consultant satisfaction Net Promoter Score is 61%; additionally, 71% of consultants rated us a 9 or a 10 out of 10.
Enhance Shareholder Value. Kforce is committed to continue to invest in our business to generate long-term shareholder value while appropriately balancing the return of capital to our shareholders. In 2016, the Firm continued to repurchase a significant amount of stock under the Board-authorized program and completed four quarterly dividends. Kforce expects to focus on reducing expenses and anticipates continuing with our share repurchase program and dividends in 2017. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented specialty staffing services industry within each of our reporting segments. We face substantial competition from large national firms and local specialty staffing firms. The local firms are typically operator-owned, and each market generally has one or more significant competitors. We also face competition from national clerical and light industrial staffing firms, and national and regional accounting firms that also offer certain specialty staffing services. We believe, however, that our geographic presence, diversified service offerings, national delivery teams, enhanced sales methodology, focus on consistent service and delivery and effective job order prioritization all provide a competitive advantage, particularly with clients that have operations in multiple geographic markets. In addition, we believe that our service offerings are primarily concentrated in areas with significant growth opportunities in both the short and long term. 
In addition, many companies utilize Managed Service Providers (“MSP”) or Vendor Management Organizations (“VMO”) for the management and purchase of staffing services. Generally, MSPs and VMOs are organizations that standardize processes through the use of Vendor Management Systems (“VMS”), which are tools used to aggregate spend and measure supplier performance. VMSs can also be provided through independent providers. Typically, MSPs, VMOs and/or VMS providers charge staffing firms administrative fees of 1% to 4% of total service revenues, and these fees are usually recorded by staffing firms as a cost of services, thereby compressing profit margins. While Kforce does not currently provide MSP or VMO services directly to its clients, our strategy is to work with MSP, VMO and VMS providers that enable us to best extend our Flex staffing services to current and prospective clients.
Kforce believes that the availability and quality of associates, candidates and consultants, level of service, effective monitoring of job performance, scope of geographic service, compliance orientation and price are the principal elements of competition in our industry. We believe that availability of quality associates, candidates and consultants is especially important. In order to attract candidates and consultants, we place emphasis upon our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits, quality and varied assignments, scheduling flexibility, and permanent placement opportunities, all of which are important to Kforce being the “Employer of Choice.” Because personnel pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis, it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals, and focus on our consultant care objectives. Additionally, in certain markets and in response to economic softening, we have experienced significant pricing pressure as a result of our competitors’ pricing strategies. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition and pricing pressure to continue, which may result in us not being able to effectively compete or choosing to not participate in certain business that does not meet our profitability standard.

Regulatory Environment
Staffing firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and its staff, such as wage and hour regulations, tax withholding and reporting, immigration regulations, social security and other retirement, anti-discrimination, employee benefits and workers’ compensation regulations; (2) registration, licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; (3) worker classification regulations and (4) substantive limitations on their operations. 
In providing staffing and solution services to the Federal Government, we must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of Federal Government contracts. These laws and regulations create compliance risk and affect how we do business with our federal agency clients, and may impose added costs on our business.
In the increasingly stringent regulatory environment, one of our top priorities is compliance. As we continue to evolve our infrastructure, compliance remains a primary focus. For more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on Kforce’s financial results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors below.
Operating Employees and Personnel
As of December 31, 2016, Kforce employed nearly 2,800 associates and had more than 11,800 consultants on assignment providing flexible staffing services and solutions to our clients. Approximately 91% of the consultants are employed directly by Kforce (“Flexible Employees”); the balance consists of individuals who are employed by other entities (“Independent Contractors”) that provide their employees as subcontractors to Kforce for assignment to Kforce’s clients. As the employer, Kforce is responsible for the employer’s share of applicable social security taxes (“FICA”), federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance, and other direct labor costs relating to our employees. We offer access to various health, life and disability insurance programs and other benefits for our employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption, and are unaware of any current efforts or plans to organize any of our employees.
Insurance
Kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, automobile liability and employers’ liability; each with excess liability coverage. We also maintain workers’ compensation, fidelity, fiduciary, directors and officers, cybersecurity, professional liability, excess health insurance and employment practices liability policies. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from Kforce’s operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
