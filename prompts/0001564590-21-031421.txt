Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users.  
 
Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers whom we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide.  There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business.  However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.  Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which we refer to as fiscal 2021, while a different customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, which we refer to as fiscal 2020.

As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy, we have increased our domestic sales in 2021.  Over a business cycle in the energy markets, our domestic sales will generally range between 50% and 70% of total sales.  The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year.  
 
Our backlog at March 31, 2021 was $137,567 compared with $112,389 at March 31, 2020.
 Our Strengths
 
Our core strengths include:
  
• | We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform. We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages. We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities. We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve. We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders. The orders we receive are extremely complex and we believe that our order management platforms provide another competitive differentiator for our company. In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself. We have developed strong order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment in a timely manner. For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized once an order is received. Customers’ supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment. We believe our operations platform is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications. We also believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business. While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification. Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production. The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have the capability to manage outsourced production. Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness. We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements and 3. addressing localized content requirements. We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that is on-time, within budget and that meets our high quality standards. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We provide robust after-the-sale technical support. Our engineering and performance improvement personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues. Technical service after a sale is important to our customers as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize their facilities’ productivity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition. On June 1, 2021 we utilized $41,150 of cash and investments to acquire BNI.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a high-quality credit facility. On March 31, 2021 our credit facilities provided $37,000 of borrowing capacity. On June 1, 2021 we entered into new credit agreements which provide $57,500 of borrowing capacity, including a $20,000 term loan to acquire BNI. We also reissued approximately 610 treasury shares with a value of approximately $8,963. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 
We intend to strategically leverage and deploy our assets, including but not limited to, financial, technical, manufacturing and industry know-how, in order to capture expanded market share within the geographies and industries we serve, expand revenue opportunities in adjacent and countercyclical markets and continually improve our results of operations in order to:
 
•Generate sustainable earnings growth;
 •Reduce earnings volatility;
 •Improve our operating performance;
 •Generate strong cash flow from operations to reinvest in our business or return to shareholders in the form of ordinary
 dividends; and 
 •Provide an acceptable return to our shareholders.
 To accomplish our objectives and maintain strategic focus, we believe that we must:
  
• | Successfully deploy our corporate assets to expand our market share in the industries we currently serve, access and develop a stronger presence in industries where historically we have not had a strong presence, and pursue acquisitions, partnerships and/or other business combinations in order to enter new geographic or industrial markets, new product lines or expand our coverage in existing markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identify organic growth opportunities and consummate acquisitions where we believe the strength of the Graham brand will provide us with the ability to expand and complement our core businesses. We intend to extend our existing product lines, move into complementary product lines and expand our global sales presence in order to further broaden our existing markets and reach additional markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COVID-19 Pandemic Impact
 
               The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business, our customers’ businesses, and the markets we serve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and has continued to rapidly evolve.  The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the already volatile oil industry and markets.  The pandemic impacted both our capital equipment sales as well as our short cycle business.
               Our proactive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included approximately three weeks of limited production at our facility in Batavia, New York beginning in late March 2020.  We began bringing back our personnel early in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and by June 2020, we had nearly all of our pre-COVID-19 pandemic headcount in our factory, subject to numerous new health and safety protocols as recommended by our federal and local authorities, including requiring appropriate personal protective equipment to be worn by everyone onsite, social distancing markers, staggered employee breaks and meetings to reduce group gatherings, expanded hygiene practices, and barriers as appropriate to separate workers based on our plant layout configuration.  We deployed numerous laptop computers to our sales, engineering, quality, supply chain, finance, and administrative personnel to facilitate remote work.  Throughout fiscal 2021, we limited external visitors to our Batavia facility and those few that were allowed were pre-approved and tested for COVID-19.  We continue to utilize certain pandemic response measures.  Our workforce safety and employee well-being continue to be top priorities and we remain committed to the service of our customers and suppliers.  For further information on the risks posed to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A - Risk Factors below, and our discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout this report.  Our first quarter operated at approximately 50% throughput capacity and during the third and fourth quarters at roughly 90% throughput capacity due to the measures taken to protect employees from the spread of COVID-19.
