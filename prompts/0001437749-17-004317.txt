ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs that we believe will be improved versions of widely prescribed, approved drugs. We employ our Ligand Activated Therapy, or LAT, platform technology to create our prodrugs. We are building a pipeline of prodrug product candidates that target large market opportunities in pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. Our two lead product candidates are KP415, our extended release, or ER, d-threo-methylphenidate product candidate for the treatment of ADHD, and KP201/IR, our acetaminophen, or APAP, free, single-entity, benzhydrocodone hydrochloride immediate-release, or IR, abuse-deterrent product candidate designed for the treatment of acute pain. We own worldwide commercial rights for all of our product candidates, except that Shire Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Shire, has a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415.
 
We previously submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our product candidate Apadaz, which consists of KP201, our prodrug of hydrocodone, and acetaminophen. In June 2016, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, for our Apadaz NDA. Generally, the FDA issues CRLs to indicate that the FDA considers the review cycle for an application complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. In its CRL, the FDA advised us that it did not believe our proposed labeling included in the application accurately conveyed the outcome of our abuse deterrence studies of Apadaz. In August 2016, we completed our end-of-review meeting with the FDA. At the end-of-review meeting, we discussed with the FDA the issues identified by the FDA in the Apadaz NDA and what we believe is the potential to achieve a path forward for an Apadaz product label that could include abuse deterrence claims. The meeting also involved discussions pertaining to abuse deterrence in relation to the broader IR prescription opioid market, hydrocodone-acetaminophen combination products, and published industry guidance from the FDA concerning the evaluation and labeling of abuse deterrent opioids. In November 2016, we elected to continue the regulatory review process for Apadaz with the submission of a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR, to the FDA. We anticipate up to twelve months may be required to complete all parts of the FDRR process.
 
Key members of our senior management, while at New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., were instrumental in the development of Vyvanse, a prodrug of amphetamine indicated for ADHD, through FDA marketing approval. New River Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire plc in 2007 and Vyvanse generated over $2.0 billion in sales in 2016.
 
We use our LAT platform technology to discover and develop prodrugs that improve one or more of the attributes of approved drugs, such as susceptibility to abuse, bioavailability and safety. A prodrug is a precursor chemical compound of a drug that is inactive or less than fully active, which is then converted in the body to its active form through a normal metabolic process. Where possible, we seek, in part, to develop prodrugs that will be eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FFDCA, otherwise known as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which allows us to rely on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products, if we demonstrate such reliance is scientifically appropriate. Because our prodrugs are novel combinations of an FDA-approved drug, referred to as the parent drug, with one or more ligands, they may be new molecular entities, or NMEs, and thus may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection. An NME is a drug containing an active ingredient that has not been approved or marketed in the United States.
 
We intend to advance our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of ADHD, pain and various CNS indications, and we anticipate reporting human proof-of-concept, or POC, data for KP201/IR in 2018, additional pharmacokinetic, or PK, data for KP415 in 2017 and pivotal efficacy trial data for KP415 in 2018. We filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for KP511/ER, our extended release formulation of KP511, our prodrug of hydromorphone, for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate, which took effect in March 2016 and received "Fast Track" designation by the FDA in May 2016. We also filed an IND for KP415, which took effect in October 2016, and an IND for KP201/IR, which took effect in November 2016 and received "Fast Track" designation for KP201/IR in December 2016. In addition, we anticipate submitting an NDA for each of KP415 and KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2018, potentially followed by an NDA for each of KP511/IR and KP511/ER in 2019. We plan to employ our LAT platform technology and development expertise to develop additional product candidates that address unmet medical needs in large, established markets. We believe our product candidates may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection and we intend to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway when available, which we believe may reduce drug development time, risk and expense.
 
As of December 31, 2016, our patent portfolio consisted of 69 granted patents and 70 pending patent applications worldwide. Within that patent portfolio, we have received granted U.S. composition-of-matter patents covering KP201, KP201-related compositions-of-matter, and prodrugs underlying two of our other product candidates.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel prodrugs. Key components of our strategy include, for example:
 

● | Leverage our LAT platform technology to improve the attributes of approved drugs in large markets. We plan to employ our LAT platform technology to develop additional prodrugs that have improved properties over approved drugs and address unmet medical needs in large, established markets. We intend to develop prodrugs of FDA-approved drugs in multiple therapeutic areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance the development of our pipeline product candidates. We plan to advance the development of our lead product candidates, KP415, for the treatment of ADHD and KP201/IR (APAP-free), for the short-term management of acute pain. We plan to initiate PK and human abuse liability studies related to KP415 and KP201/IR, respectively, in 2017. We also anticipate beginning a pivotal efficacy trial for KP415 in 2017. We are also developing KP511/ER, for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate, KP511/IR, for the short duration management of acute pain, KP303, our prodrug of quetiapine, for the treatment of schizophrenia and other CNS disorders, KP606/IR, our IR formulation of our prodrug of oxycodone, for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate, and KP746, our prodrug of oxymorphone, for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.

Our LAT Prodrug Platform Technology
 
We use our LAT platform technology to create prodrugs by chemically attaching one or more molecules, referred to as ligands, to an FDA-approved parent drug. We typically use ligands that have been demonstrated to be safe in toxicological studies or have been granted Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, status for food use by the FDA. Our prodrugs are chemical successors of the parent drugs, but may be considered to be NMEs and thus may be eligible for potential protection by composition-of-matter patents. When the prodrug is administered to a patient as intended, the targeted human metabolic processes, such as those in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract, separate the ligand from the prodrug and release the parent drug, which can then exert its therapeutic effect. We select ligands that, when combined with the parent drug, create prodrugs believed to have improved drug attributes while maintaining efficacy potentially equivalent to the parent drug.
 
We believe that our LAT platform technology offers the following potential benefits:
 

● | Improved drug properties. We seek to develop prodrugs with improved attributes over FDA-approved drugs, such as reduced susceptibility to abuse, enhanced bioavailability and increased safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. Our prodrugs combine an FDA-approved parent drug with one or more ligands to create NMEs and may be eligible for patent protection, provided that all other applicable legal and regulatory requirements are met. We seek patent protection not only for our prodrug product candidates, but also for related compounds with the intention of creating potential heightened barriers to market entry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eligibility for 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Our LAT platform technology allows us to develop prodrugs that may be eligible to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Under that regulatory pathway, if we are able to demonstrate the bioequivalence of our product candidates to appropriate approved drugs, we will then be able to reference the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the approved drugs in our 505(b)(2) NDA submissions. This may allow us to avoid the significant time and expense of conducting large clinical trials and eliminate the need for some preclinical activities.

The Unmet Need for Addressing Early Morning Behavioral Deficits and Maintaining Consistent, Sustained Efficacy in Daily ADHD Treatment
 
The ADHD market is relatively well served by a number of methylphenidate and amphetamine stimulate products. While many of the currently marketed stimulant products provide good symptom control for up to 12 hours post-dose, there is increasing attention to addressing early morning behavioral deficits.
 
Such early-morning deficits can include difficulties getting out of bed, difficulty getting ready for school, arguing and excessive struggling, and extreme irritability. A recent study, authored by Floyd R. Sallee and published in the Journal of Child & Adolescent Psychopharmacology, entitled "Early Morning Functioning in Stimulant-Treated Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and its Impact on Caregivers," characterized the frequency and severity of ADHD symptoms throughout the day in children and adolescents treated with stable doses of stimulant medications. 
 
Results of that particular study indicated that the most severe symptoms occurred during the early morning routine, followed by evening homework time and bedtime. The time from awakening to arriving at school can comprise up to 20% of waking hours per day (2-3 hours), and therefore such symptoms can cause significant distress for both children and caregivers. Therefore, we believe there is a need to develop a methylphenidate product that provides early-morning control of symptoms while also providing sustained, consistent efficacy through the day and into the early evening hours.

The Epidemic of Prescription Drug Abuse in the United States
 
The United States is facing an epidemic of prescription drug abuse. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, prescription drug overdose death rates in the United States have increased five-fold since 1980, and by 2009, drug overdose deaths outnumbered deaths due to motor vehicle crashes. HHS also estimates that opioid analgesics were involved in approximately 60% of U.S. drug overdose deaths where a drug was specified in 2010. The economic costs of this public health problem are significant. A study published in 2011 in a peer-reviewed medical journal estimated that the costs of the non-medical use of prescription opioids in the United States are over $50 billion annually, including medical and substance abuse treatment costs, lost work productivity and criminal justice costs.
 
The increasing negative social consequences and costs of prescription drug abuse have led to a number of regulatory and legislative actions and proposals, including:
 

● | FDA Guidance. In January 2013, the FDA published draft guidance with regard to the evaluation and labeling of abuse-deterrent opioids. The guidance was published in final form in April 2015. The FDA guidance provides direction as to the studies and data required for obtaining abuse-deterrent claims in a product label. The draft guidance describes four categories of label claims for abuse-deterrent products. Depending on product and study data, a combination of categories can be included in the label claims. The FDA guidance lists the following theoretical examples:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Category 1–in vitro data demonstrate the product has physical and chemical properties that are expected to deter intravenous abuse. However, abuse is still possible by the oral and nasal routes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Category 1 and 2–in vitro data demonstrate that the product has physical and chemical properties that are expected to deter oral, nasal and intravenous abuse. However, abuse of intact product is still possible by the oral route.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Category 2 and 3–pharmacokinetic and clinical abuse potential studies indicate that the product has properties that are expected to deter abuse via the oral, intranasal and intravenous routes. However, abuse of product by these routes is still possible.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Category 4–data demonstrated a reduction in the abuse of the product in the community setting compared to the levels of abuse, overdose, and death that occurred when only formulations of the same opioid without abuse-deterrent properties were available. This reduction in abuse appears to be attributable to the product’s formulation, which deters abuse by injection or snorting of the manipulated product. However, such abuse of this product is still possible, and the product’s abuse deterrence properties do not deter abuse associated with swallowing the intact formulation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If a product is approved by the FDA to include such claims in its label, the applicant may use information about the abuse-deterrent features of the product in its marketing efforts to physicians.
 

● | FDA Authority. In an April 2013 letter to the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Energy and Commerce, the FDA outlined its authority to address the issue of prescription opioid abuse in the United States. The FDA asserted that, if it determines that a formulation of an extended-release opioid drug product has abuse-deterrent properties, it has the authority to refrain from approving non-abuse-deterrent formulations of the drug and to initiate procedures to withdraw the non-abuse-deterrent formulations already on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA Action. The FDA has approved the inclusion of language regarding the ability to deter abuse in the product labels for nine abuse-deterrent opioids, OxyContin, Targiniq ER, Embeda, Hysingla, MorphaBond, Xtampza, Troxyca, Arymo and Vantrela. These actions reinforce the FDA’s public statement that the development of abuse-deterrent opioid analgesics is a public health priority.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA Public Meetings. In October 2014, the FDA hosted a public meeting to discuss the development, assessment and regulation of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid medications. In the announcement for the public meeting, the FDA anticipated that, after abuse-deterrent formulations become available for a number of different opioid medications and after it gains more experience with formulations with meaningful abuse-deterrent properties, the FDA may determine that the risks outweigh the benefits for all or most opioid products without abuse-deterrent properties. On October 31 and November 1, 2016, the FDA convened a public meeting for Abuse-Deterrent Generic Products and Standardization of In Vitro Testing. The public meeting was held to review and evaluate FDA draft guidance to establish a pathway for generic abuse-deterrent formulation approvals and to standardize testing requirements for In Vitro testing regimes. The FDA has not indicated a timeline for finalizing this draft guidance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Prodrug Product Candidates
 
We have employed our LAT platform technology to create a portfolio of product candidates that we believe will offer significant improvements over FDA-approved and widely prescribed drugs. Our pipeline of product candidates is summarized in the table below:
 
Selected KemPharm Prodrug Product Candidates
 

 | Product | Development | Key 
-------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
Indication / Parent Drug | Candidate | Status | Milestone 
ADHD | | | 
Methylphenidate (controlled release) | KP415 | Clinical | NDA Submission - 2018 Pivotal Efficacy Trial Data - 2018 
Pain | | | 
Hydrocodone (IR) | KP201/IR (APAP-free) | "Fast Track" Designation December 2016 | NDA Submission - 2018 Human POC Data - 2017 
Hydromorphone (ER) | KP511/ER | "Fast Track" Designation May 2016 | NDA Submission - 2019 Human POC Data - 2018 
Hydromorphone (IR) | KP511/IR | Clinical | NDA Submission - 2019 Human POC Data - 2018 
Oxycodone (IR) | KP606/IR | Preclinical | 
Oxymorphone | KP746 | Preclinical | 
CNS | | | 
Quetiapine | KP303 | Preclinical | 

 
KP415
 
Overview
 
KP415 is our prodrug of methylphenidate, which we are developing for the treatment of ADHD. The ADHD market is largely served by the stimulant products methylphenidate and amphetamine. KP415 is designed to be a controlled release, or CR, abuse-deterrent methylphenidate product.
 
We plan to seek approval of KP415 under the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway, which will not allow us to rely on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for one or more approved products that may be available for a 505(b)(2) NDA. We anticipate reporting additional PK data for KP415 in  2017 and pivotal efficacy trial data for KP415 in 2018 and submitting a 505(b)(1) NDA for KP415 in 2018. KP415 has received "Fast Track" designation by the FDA.
 
Under our asset purchase agreement with Shire, we granted Shire a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415. The right of first refusal may be exercised by Shire for a period of 30 business days following Shire's receipt of written notice from us of the existence of a bona fide offer from a third party to acquire, license or commercialize KP415.
 
We are also party to an agreement with MonoSol Rx, LLC, or MonoSol, pursuant to which MonoSol has the right to receive an amount equal to a percentage in the low teens of any value generated by KP415, and any product candidates arising therefrom, including royalty payments on any license of KP415, the sale of KP415 to a third party or the commercialization of KP415.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe the ADHD market would be receptive to new branded drugs that have improved properties when compared to current treatments. We believe a new product in the form of a prodrug that has abuse-deterrent features and a more consistent controlled release drug delivery mechanism may provide a new treatment option in this large market segment. While methylphenidate is available as a generic product, the branded formulations, Concerta, Focalin XR, Quillivant XR and Daytrana, accounted for sales of $800 million in 2016.
Key Product Features of KP415
 
Based on our preclinical and clinical data, we believe KP415, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians, and society when compared to other FDA-approved and widely prescribed methylphenidate products:
 

● | Abuse-deterrent technology. In order to evaluate the abuse-deterrent qualities of KP415, we conducted preclinical studies in rats to compare the exposure to methylphenidate following intranasal and intravenous, or IV, administration of KP415 as compared to intranasal and IV administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride. We observed significantly lower concentrations of methylphenidate following intranasal and IV administration of KP415 compared to intranasal and IV administered methylphenidate hydrochloride. KP415 incorporates our LAT platform technology and, based on our preclinical and clinical studies, we believe it will have abuse-deterrent characteristics. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Faster early-morning symptom control and sustained effectiveness. In December 2016, we announced the results of our Phase I POC clinical trial of KP415. This trial was designed to assess the relative PK of 32 mg of KP415 compared with 36 mg of Concerta after oral administration under fasted conditions. In this trial, we observed that KP415 had PK properties that produced earlier d-methylphenidate exposure followed by a slower extended release of d-methylphenidate relative to the comparator, Concerta. We believe that this PK profile may provide quicker onset of action than existing alternatives, thereby providing faster control of symptoms following administration early in the morning, as well as sustained, consistent effectiveness through the day and into the early evening hours. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Once-daily dosing. PK data from our preclinical studies suggest that the time to maximum plasma concentration of methylphenidate after oral administration of KP415 is approximately three times longer than that after oral administration of currently marketed IR methylphenidate. We believe this CR attribute of KP415 may allow for convenient, once-daily dosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amenable to patient-friendly formulations. Although we believe our prodrug, KP415, possesses abuse-deterrent properties, our preclinical and clinical data shows that KP415 could ultimately be used in a variety of patient-friendly dosage forms such as oral thin film, orally dissolving tablets, chewable tablets and liquids as a means of increasing patient convenience and compliance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. KP415 is generally protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible term extensions, in 2032. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic market opportunities, and, as of December 31, 2016, a composition-of-matter patent on KP415 was granted in New Zealand and South Africa, and additional KP415 patent filings were pending in the United States and an additional 23 foreign jurisdictions. In addition, subject to further discussions with the FDA, we believe KP415 may be eligible for new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity status, which could allow for five years of U.S. market exclusivity following the FDA's approval of an NDA for KP415.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. KP415 is a prodrug that we believe will be given a new chemical name, which could mean that there would be no generic equivalent product for KP415 in most states, making drug-equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KP201/IR (APAP-free)
 
Overview
 
KP201/IR (APAP-free), is an IR formulation of KP201 without any APAP. We are developing KP201/IR (APAP-free) for the short-term management of acute pain. KP201/IR (APAP-free) is designed to be an abuse-deterrent opioid product that offers comparable efficacy to the existing standard-of-care, IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products, such as Vicodin, Norco and Lortab, but with the potential safety advantage of having no added APAP.
 
We anticipate intitiating human clinical trials in 2017, including an intranasal human abuse liability study. Based on our current development timelines, we anticipate submitting an NDA utilizing the 505(b)(1) pathway for KP201/IR (APAP-free) in 2018. We believe that KP201/IR (APAP-free), like other abuse-deterrent opioids, would receive priority review. KP201/IR (APAP-free) has received "Fast Track" designation by the FDA.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Currently, there are no IR hydrocodone products approved in the United States that are formulated without APAP, with or without an abuse-deterrent label. We believe KP201/IR (APAP-free), if approved, would provide physicians with an abuse-deterrent hydrocodone product alternative not currently available to help them with the short-term management of acute pain in patients.
 
Key Product Features of KP201/IR (APAP-free)
 
We believe KP201/IR (APAP-free), if approved by the FDA, may have many valuable product features and may provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society:
 

● | Abuse-deterrent technology. KP201/IR (APAP-free) uses our KP201 prodrug, which incorporates our LAT platform technology, to create its abuse-deterrent properties and thus may provide a higher barrier against attempted abuse than many existing formulation-based approaches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No added APAP. KP201/IR (APAP-free) contains no acetaminophen. According to the FDA, overdoses of APAP are the most common cause of drug-related liver injury. In 2011, the FDA limited the amount of APAP in prescription combination products and required warnings be added to all APAP prescription products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. KP201/IR (APAP-free) is protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on KP201 that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, no earlier than 2030.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. We believe the difference in chemical name, prescription strength and lack of APAP in the formulation may potentially mean that there will be no generic equivalent product for KP201/IR (APAP-free) in most states, making drug equivalent substitution potentially difficult at the pharmacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenient dosing. We believe that KP201/IR (APAP-free) will be as convenient as existing IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KP511
 
Overview
 
KP511 is our prodrug of hydromorphone, which we are developing for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. We are currently working on an ER and IR formulation of KP511. KP511 is designed to be an abuse-deterrent opioid product that offers equivalent efficacy to approved hydromorphone products. KP511 combines hydromorphone with one or more ligands. We believe KP511 does not release its hydromorphone component until it is metabolized in the GI tract following oral administration. We believe KP511 is highly tamper-resistant and is stable under conditions that can potentially defeat many formulation-based abuse-deterrent technologies.
 
We plan to seek approval of KP511/ER and KP511/IR under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that KP511 may release hydromorphone after oral administration in humans in a manner that is comparable to the appropriate approved hydromorphone drug. We anticipate reporting human POC data for KP511/ER and KP511/IR in 2018 and submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA for KP511/ER and KP511/IR in 2019.
 
In June 2016, we announced results from a Phase 1 POC trial of KP511. In the trial, we observed comparable hydromorphone exposure between 4 mg Dilaudid Oral Liquid and an equimolar 8 mg dose of KP511. Additionally, in January 2017, we announced the results of our exploratory Phase 1, double-blind, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, randomized, crossover study, intended to assess the PK, safety and intranasal abuse potential of KP511, compared to equivalent doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride, or HM. In this trial, KP511 produced statistically significant reduction in peak and overall hydromorphone exposure with KP511 versus HM. The improved PK of KP511 resulted in meaningful, statistically lower scores in the exploratory pharmacodynamic measures of "Drug Liking," "Feeling High," "Overall Drug Liking" and "Take Drug Again" when compared to HM.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Oral hydromorphone products are typically used for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. SHS estimates that in 2016 there were nearly 3 million dispensed prescriptions of hydromorphone in the United States. Currently, there are no hydromorphone products approved in the United States with an abuse-deterrent label. 
 
Key Product Features of KP511/ER
 
Based on our clinical and preclinical data, we believe KP511/ER and KP511/IR, if approved by the FDA, may have valuable product features and provide significant benefits to patients, physicians and society when compared to FDA-approved hydromorphone products:
 

● | Abuse-deterrent technology. In order to evaluate the abuse-deterrent qualities of KP511, we conducted clinical and preclinical studies of KP511. As described above, our Phase 1 POC trial of KP511 produced meaningful, statistically lower scores in the exploratory pharmacodynamic measures of "Drug Liking," "Feeling High," "Overall Drug Liking" and "Take Drug Again" when compared to HM. We also conducted preclinical studies in rats to compare the exposure to hydromorphone following intranasal and IV administration of KP511 as compared to intranasal and IV administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride. We observed significantly lower concentrations of hydromorphone following intranasal and IV administration of KP511 compared to intranasal and IV administered hydromorphone hydrochloride. KP511 incorporates our LAT platform technology to create its abuse-deterrent properties and, based on our preclinical and clinical studies, we believe it may have abuse-deterrent characteristics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oral overdose protection. In our preclinical studies, we observed that hydromorphone blood levels in rats increased more slowly and to a lesser extent after oral administration of increasing excessively large doses of KP511, as compared to increasing equimolar oral doses of hydromorphone hydrochloride. Thus, as to KP511, we believe it is possible that the metabolic processes of releasing hydromorphone from the prodrug become saturated at excessively large oral doses. If confirmed by further studies, this could potentially mean that KP511 may reduce the risk of oral overdosing.

● | Composition-of-matter patent protection. KP511/ER and KP511/IR are protected by a U.S. composition-of-matter patent on KP511 that will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2032. Our patent strategy is focused primarily on key geographic market opportunities, and, as of December 31, 2016, a composition-of-matter patent on KP511 was granted in Australia, Japan, Philippines, New Zealand, South Africa, and Singapore, and applications covering KP511 were pending in the United States and an additional 20 foreign jurisdictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No generic equivalent product. KP511 is a prodrug that we believe will be given a new chemical name, which would mean that there may be no generic equivalent product for KP511/ER or KP511/IR in most states, making drug equivalent substitution difficult at the pharmacy.

Other Product Candidates
 
We are using our LAT platform technology to develop other product candidates in pain. One example is KP606/IR, an IR formulation of KP606, our prodrug of oxycodone, which we are developing for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. KP606/IR is designed to be an IR abuse-deterrent opioid product that may potentially offer equivalent efficacy to OxyContin. KP606 combines oxycodone with one or more ligands. Another example is KP746, our prodrug of oxymorphone, which is currently in preclinical development. We are developing KP746 for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.
 
In addition to our product candidates in pain, we are using our LAT platform technology to develop product candidates for the treatment of CNS disorders. KP303, our prodrug of quetiapine, is currently in preclinical development. We are developing KP303 for the treatment of CNS disorders.

Our Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property strategy includes seeking composition-of-matter patents, among other patents, for our prodrugs and product candidates and conjugates of our prodrugs while also protecting, where appropriate as trade secrets, our LAT platform technology, the process by which we identify, screen, evaluate and select ligands to be conjugated with parent drugs to create our prodrugs. Our current prodrugs all consist of an approved parent drug and one or more ligands that we have selected using our LAT platform technology. The parent drug and ligand or ligands together may potentially constitute an NME and thus may be eligible for composition-of-matter patent protection, among other patent protections, in the United States and abroad.
 
To date, we have internally developed all of our intellectual property, related to our LAT platform technology. As of December 31, 2016, we have been granted 14 issued patents within the United States, and an additional 55 foreign patents covering our prodrugs or product candidates. The terms of the 14 issued U.S. patents extend to various dates ranging, for example, between 2030 and 2032. The term of our overall domestic and foreign patent portfolio related to our prodrugs and product candidates, including patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, extend to various dates ranging, for example, between 2030 and 2032, if pending patent applications in each of our patent families issue as patents. As of December 31, 2016, we filed 11 pending patent applications under active prosecution in the United States, and an additional 59 pending foreign patent applications potentially covering our prodrugs and product candidates. Our issued and granted patents provide protection in jurisdictions that include the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, Singapore, Indonesia and South Africa. 
 
In 2013, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, issued a composition-of-matter patent covering KP201, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, no earlier than 2030. Further, there are granted or recently allowed compositions-of-matter patents covering KP201 in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Ukraine, Indonesia and South Africa. In addition, one U.S. patent application covering KP201-related compositions-of-matter was pending as of December 31, 2016, and patent applications covering KP201 were pending as of December 31, 2016, in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Belarus, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Europe, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Oman, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
 
In August 2014, the USPTO issued a composition-of-matter patent covering KP511, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding possible patent term extensions, in 2032. In July 2015, the USPTO issued a composition-of-matter patent generally covering KP415, which will expire, after utilizing all appropriate patent term adjustments but excluding patent term extensions, in 2032. We have also filed composition-of-matter patent applications for KP415 and KP511 in the United States and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Hong Kong, Europe, India, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam and South Africa. We anticipate filing additional patent applications for our prodrug product candidates.
 
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our LAT platform technology, as well as any proprietary know-how and show-how beyond that which is patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, inventions and improvements important to our business.
 
Commercialization
 
We have not yet begun commercialization activities for any our product candidates in active development. Because many of our product candidates may have large potential market opportunities, and may require significant marketing resources, we may conclude that the most appropriate approach to their commercialization, if they receive regulatory approval, will involve forming a commercial collaboration or strategic relationship, or consummating some type of strategic transaction, with a larger pharmaceutical or other marketing organization. Alternatively, we may conclude that building our own focused sales and marketing organization will be most appropriate, perhaps as part of a co-promotional arrangement, or some other form of collaboration. As we get closer to potential approval of our product candidates, we will work to identify and implement the commercialization strategies that we conclude are the most desirable with regard to the specific product candidates.
Research and Development
 
Historically, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $20.5 million, $13.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. We plan to increase our research and development expense for the foreseeable future as we continue our efforts to commercialize, if approved, and further advance the development of our product candidates, subject to the availability of additional funding.
 
 10



Competition
 
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We will face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include their potential degree of abuse deterrence, onset of action, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, convenience of dosing, safety, tolerability and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and  human  resources  than  we  do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop abuse-deterrent or other products for the treatment of ADHD, the short-term management of acute pain, or for other indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials. 
 
If approved, KP415 will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently marketed products include Johnson & Johnson's Concerta, Novartis AG's Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Focalin and Focalin XR, UCB S.A.'s Metadate CD, and Noven Pharmaceuticals' Daytrana, in addition to multiple other branded and generic methylphenidate products marketed by companies including Allergan plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP415 will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent or other methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
If approved, our abuse-deterrent opioid product candidates will face competition from commercially available branded and generic opioid drugs, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, morphine, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as other marketed non-opioid products for the treatment of pain, and potential competition from opioid and non-opioid products for the treatment of pain that are currently in clinical development. In addition, our product candidates will face competition from approved and abuse-deterrent labeled opioid drugs and potential competition from abuse-deterrent opioid drugs that are currently in clinical development. We may compete with multiple companies that have developed and are developing abuse-deterrent technologies that may be applied to a variety of drugs, including those being developed for the short-term management of acute pain as well as for other indications that we are pursuing or may pursue in the future. If approved, our abuse-deterrent opioid product candidates may face competition from opioid products or abuse-deterrent technologies from companies including Allergan plc, Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Depomed, Inc., DURECT Corporation, Egalet Corporation, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo International plc, Grünenthal Group, Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, IntelliPharmaceutics International Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Mylan Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pain Therapeutics, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., Signature Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Trevena Inc. and UCB S.A.
 
If approved, KP201/IR (APAP-free) will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic IR hydrocodone/APAP combination products indicated for the short-term management of acute pain. Some of these currently marketed products include AbbVie's Vicodin, Allergan's Norco, Shionogi's Xodol and UCB Pharma's Lortab, in addition to multiple other branded and generic hydrocodone/APAP combination products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Endo International plc and Mallinckrodt plc. In addition, if approved, KP201/IR (APAP-free) will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent IR or hydrocodone/APAP combination or other APAP-free products for the short-term management of acute pain that are currently in or may enter into clinical development.
 
If approved, KP511 will compete against currently marketed, branded and generic, IR and ER hydromorphone products approved for use in opioid-tolerant patients for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Some of these currently marketed products include Purdue Pharma L.P.’s Dilaudid and Mallinckrodt plc’s Exalgo, in addition to multiple other branded and generic IR and ER hydromorphone products marketed by companies including Allergan plc, Mallinckrodt plc, Rhodes Pharmaceuticals L.P. and Roxanne Laboratories, Inc. In addition, if approved, KP511/ER and KP511/IR will face potential competition from any abuse-deterrent or other IR and ER hydromorphone products for the treatment of pain that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing strategy is to rely on contract manufacturers to produce our prodrug product candidates for clinical trials and, if approved, drug product for commercial sale. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on Johnson Matthey Inc., or JMI, a third-party manufacturer, to produce the bulk quantities of KP201 required for the manufacture of the KP201/IR used in our clinical trials under a supply agreement. JMI is also currently contracted to manufacture of KP511 to be used in our non-clinical, clinical and formulation development programs needed to support an NDA filing. We have contracted with another third-party manufacturer to supply KP415 to be used in our non-clinical, clinical and formulation development programs necessary to support an NDA filing. We plan to continue to rely on these manufacturers to manufacture commercial quantities of KP201 used in production of KP201/IR, KP511 and KP415, respectively, for sale in the United States, if and when we receive approval by the FDA. We expect to contract with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of all API supply needs outside the United States if and when we receive approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States.
 
Our current and any future third-party manufacturers, their facilities and all lots of drug substance and drug products used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our current and any future third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 
Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonments.

Supply Agreement with Johnson Matthey
 
Under our supply agreement with JMI, or the Supply Agreement, JMI has agreed to supply us with all of the KP201 necessary for clinical trials and commercial sale for a price equal to JMI’s manufacturing cost and to provide process development services for KP201. In exchange, we issued shares of our common stock to JMI, provided that the commercial supply arrangement for KP201 would be exclusive to them in the United States. In addition, for further process optimization and manufacture of NDA registration batches, we agreed to pay a minimum royalty on the net sales on the commercial sale of KP201, if approved by the FDA. The percentage royalty rate ranges from the high teens at low volumes to the mid-single digits at higher volumes. Under the agreement, JMI has completed manufacture of our registration batches of KP201 and stability testing for those batches is in process.
 
Under the Supply Agreement, we retain sole ownership of KP201 and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and to pursue FDA marketing approval of KP201. We are responsible for product development, including formulation, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and for regulatory approval, quality assurance and commercialization. If KP201 is subject to a DEA scheduling quota, then each quarter, both we and JMI are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a quota from the DEA for the production of the KP201 API and for KP201.
 
We are responsible for all costs of any KP201 manufactured during a specified validation process for KP201. After completion of the validation process, but prior to the commercial launch of any products that utilize KP201 as the API, JMI will manufacture batches of KP201 at a price to be negotiated. Failure to agree upon this pricing would result in JMI supplying these batches to us free of charge and we would pay JMI an additional royalty payment on such batches. The percentage royalty rate ranges from the low teens at low volumes to the low single digits at higher volumes and is additive to any minimum royalty we may owe JMI on such batch. JMI will manufacture and supply KP201 at a price equal to JMI’s fully allocated manufacturing cost after commercial launch should we obtain approval for marketing from the FDA.
 
We must purchase all of our U.S. KP201 needs from JMI and JMI cannot supply KP201 to other companies. After the commercial launch of any product that utilizes KP201 as the API, JMI is required to identify a secondary manufacturing site and qualify and validate that site for the production of KP201.
 
The term of the Supply Agreement extends as long as we hold a valid and enforceable patent for KP201 or until the tenth anniversary of the commercial launch of any product that utilizes KP201 as the API, whichever date is later. Upon the expiration of such term, the agreement will automatically renew for a period of two years unless either party provides 12 months’ prior notice of its intent not to renew.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement with Shire LLC
 
In March 2012, as a result of a litigation settlement, we and our chief executive officer, Travis C. Mickle, Ph. D., entered into an asset purchase agreement with Shire pursuant to which we sold assets and intellectual property to Shire for proceeds of $5.1 million. As partial consideration for this sale, we and Dr. Mickle agreed not to compete with Shire in the development, commercialization, production or distribution of amphetamine amino acid conjugate products until March 21, 2017. Pursuant to this agreement, we also granted Shire a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize KP415.

Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governmental authorities, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and private managed care organizations and health insurers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay providers for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. These decisions are influenced by the existence of multiple drug products within a therapeutic class and the net cost to the plan, including the amount of the prescription price, if any, rebated by the drug’s manufacturer. Typically, generic versions of drugs are placed in a preferred tier. The position of a drug on the formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. As a result, coverage, reimbursement and placement determinations are complex and are often the subject of extensive negotiations between the payor and the owner of the drug.
 
Unless we enter into a strategic collaboration under which our collaborator assumes responsibility for seeking coverage and reimbursement for a given product, we will be responsible for negotiating coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for our product candidates. Coverage, reimbursements and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, the clinical need for the new product and the cost-effectiveness of the product. Increasingly, both purchasers and payors are also conducting comparative clinical and cost effectiveness analyses involving application of metrics, including data on patient outcomes, provided by manufacturers.
 
Within the Medicare program, as self-administered drugs, KP201/IR (APAP-free), KP303, KP415, KP511/ER, KP511/IR, KP606/IR and KP746 would be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These plans develop formularies that determine which products are covered and what co-pay will apply to covered drugs. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures, negotiating rebates with manufacturers and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products, subject to review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for discriminatory practices. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on, in whole or in part, to each of the plan’s enrollees through reduced premiums. Historically, Part D beneficiaries have been exposed to significant out-of-pocket costs after they surpass an annual coverage limit and until they reach a catastrophic coverage threshold. However, changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, will reduce this patient coverage gap, known as the “donut hole”, by transitioning patient responsibility in that coverage range from 100% in 2010 to only 25% in 2020. To help achieve this reduction, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to provide quarterly discounts of 50% off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the donut hole.
 
If a drug product is available for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid, its manufacturer must comply with various health regulatory requirements and price reporting metrics, which may include, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or the OBRA, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers with certain drugs covered by Medicaid to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. States may also negotiate “supplemental” Medicaid rebates on drug products dispensed under Medicaid. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also generally required to participate in the Public Health Service 340B Drug Discount Program, which imposes a mandatory discount on purchases by certain customers. Manufacturers of innovator drugs, including 505(b)(2) drugs, that participate in the Medicaid program are also required to offer the drugs on the Federal Supply Schedule purchasing program of the General Services Administration for purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and other authorized users at a mandatory discount. Additional laws and requirements apply to these contracts. Participation in such federal programs may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. 
 
Third-party payors, including the U.S. government, continue to apply downward pressure on the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations may result in lower reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. We expect that these trends will continue as these payors implement various proposals or regulatory policies, including various provisions of the recent health reform legislation that affect reimbursement of these products. There are currently, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement controls on reimbursement and pricing, directly and indirectly.

Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products.
 
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and GCPs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Prior to the commencement of marketing of controlled substances, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each study site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and other communications to study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans. Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise us to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
 
 14



In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 

● | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2—Controlled studies are conducted with groups of subjects with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger subject populations to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations so long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the relevance of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the NDA.
 
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
 
Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make specified financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Information about some clinical trials, including a description of the trial and trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FFDCA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

505(b)(2) Approval Process
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, or 505(b)(2), provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug for purposes of a 505(b)(2) NDA. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the reference listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Our current and anticipated product candidates are or will be based on already approved APIs in combination with a ligand. Accordingly, we have and expect to be able to continue to rely on information from studies previously conducted by the companies that obtained approval for drugs containing such APIs.
 
Orange Book Listing
 
Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, or, if permissible, are carved out.
 
If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 
 
Exclusivity
 
The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA’s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. Applicants may also seek to carve out certain drug labeling that is protected by exclusivity.
 
If a product is not eligible for the NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety, purity or potency to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
 
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The timeline for the FDA to complete its review of an NDA may differ based on whether the application is a standard review or priority review application. The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for an NME and make a decision on the application. For non-NME standard applications, the FDA has set the review goal of ten months from the submission date to complete its initial review and to make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date and non-NME applications within six months of the submission date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal and the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
 
Once the FDA’s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information or analyses in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product, or impose additional post-marketing requirements, based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.
 
FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings or precautions in the product labeling, including a black box warning. If the FDA requires a boxed warning, we would also be subject to specified promotional restrictions, such as the prohibition of reminder advertisements. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 
 17



Post-approval Requirements
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences.
 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.
 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. We, however, are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.
 
Failure to comply with any of the FDA’s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and individual imprisonment. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.
 
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
 
The FDA has the authority to require a REMS to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is an NME. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must develop the REMS program, which the FDA reviews and approves. A REMS may be required for a single drug or an entire class of drugs.
 
A REMS may be required to include various elements, including, but not limited to, a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, an implementation system, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under specified circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 
Based upon currently approved product REMS programs and class-wide REMS programs, including the class-wide REMS programs for extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesics, we believe that most of our product candidates, if approved, may be subject to a REMS. Accordingly, we expect to have to take prescribed measures to ensure the safe use of our products, if they are approved.
 
 18



DEA Regulation
 
Most of our product candidates, if approved, will be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the DEA’s implementing regulations, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics:
 

● | the drug has a high potential for abuse;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | the drug has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | abuse of the drug may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect that most of our product candidates may be listed by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. In 2014, the DEA rescheduled hydrocodone combination products into Schedule II from Schedule III. If our product candidates are ultimately listed as Schedule II controlled substances, then the importation of APIs for our product candidates, as well as the manufacture, shipping, storage, sales and use of the products, will be subject to a high degree of regulation. In addition to maintaining an importer and/or exporter registration, importers and exporters of controlled substances must obtain a permit for every import of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III, IV and V, as well as every export of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III and IV. For all other drugs in Schedule III, IV and V, importers and exporters must submit an import or export declaration. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Electronic prescriptions may also be permissible depending on the state, so long as the prescription complies with the DEA’s requirements for electronic prescriptions.
 
Controlled substances classified in Schedule III, IV, and V are also subject to registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and security requirements. For example, Schedule III drug prescriptions must be authorized by a physician and may not be refilled more than six months after the date of the original prescription or more than five times. A prescription for controlled substances classified in Schedules III, IV, and V issued by a physician, may be communicated either orally, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacies. Controlled substances that are also classified as narcotics, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and hydromorphone, are also subject to additional DEA requirements, such as manufacturer reporting of the import of narcotic raw material.
 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. Acquisition and distribution transactions must also be reported for Schedule I and II controlled substances, as well as Schedule III narcotic substances.
 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs.
 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance or Schedule III narcotic must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because most of our product candidates may be regulated as Schedule II controlled substances, they may be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids and stimulants that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II for use in manufacturing of our product candidates. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration.

Other Healthcare Regulations
 
Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the CMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including those described below.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some other healthcare criminal fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have violated the statute. The ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 
We, and our business activities, are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of some of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
 
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, require some manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report annually information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.”
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices.
 
Enforcement actions can be brought by federal or state governments or as “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government. Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.

Healthcare Reform Measures
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 
For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed. The ACA has substantially changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for specified branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, expanded health care fraud and abuse laws, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, imposed an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. There have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has on our business. Final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are anticipated in the future and we will continue to assess the ACA’s impact on us as final regulations, guidance, amendments and judicial orders are issued.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
