ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 
One Stop Systems (OSS) designs, manufactures, and markets specialized high-performance computing modules and systems targeting edge deployments.  These specialized computers and storage products incorporate state-of-the art components and allow our customers to offer high-end computing capabilities (often embbed within their equipment) to their target markets. Edge computing is when data is processed/analyzed on devices, that is, at the edge of the network, rather than in the cloud itself.  Factors such as increase in load on the cloud infrastructure globally and rises in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, are the major factors driving the growth of the edge computing market.  Our customer applications often require connection to a wide array of data sources and sensors, ultra-fast processing power and the ability to quickly access and store large and ever-growing data sets at their location not in the cloud. This equipment requires datacenter class performance optimized for deployment at the edge in challenging environments.  Unlike the controlled air-conditioned data center, many of these edge applications have unique requirements including special and compact form factors ruggedized for harsh conditions.  We are uniquely positioned as a specialized provider for the high-end of this marketplace providing custom servers, data acquisition platforms, compute accelerators, solid-state storage arrays, system IO expansion systems as well as edge optimized industrial and panel PCs, tablets and handheld compute devices. We deliver this high-end technology to our customers through the sale of equipment and embedded software.
 
The worldwide high-performance computing (HPC) market is expected to grow from $39 billion in 2019 to $50 billion by 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% while the overall edge computing market is forecasted to grow to $28.8 billion by 2025 with a compound annual growth rate of over 50% (Grandview research, “Edge Computing Market Size,” June 2019). We are establishing a leading position as a provider of specialized servers, compute accelerators and flash storage arrays to the high-end of this growing marketplace targeting edge deployments.  OSS estimates the high-performance specialized segment at the intersection of HPC and the edge computing market will be greater than $2 billion in 2023.  It is OSS’ objective to be the leading vendor and technology innovator in this targeted market segment. 
 
Through our AI on the Fly ® initiative, we are delivering innovative specialized high-performance edge computing building blocks and platforms used by our customers to develop products for scientists, engineers, creators and other professionals.  These mission critical applications capture and store data and quickly, securely, and cost effectively transform it into actionable intelligence at the edge.
 
High-performance computing applications are moving beyond the traditional academic and scientific realms to broad application across the spectrum of vertical markets. These applications include computationally intense areas like artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, media and entertainment, test and measurement, medical imaging, genomics, cyber security, automotive, aerospace and defense. We are well positioned to leverage these market trends and capitalize on our unique core competencies in high-speed system design, switch fabrics, and edge system optimization. We have a proven track record of delivering first-to-market advanced technologies and have continued to do so with next generation PCI Express (PCIe) based input/output expansion systems, compute acceleration systems and high-performance flash array storage systems. PCIe offers the highest performance and lowest latency which is critical for our target applications.  Edge optimizations include rugged chassis design with light-weight removable high-capacity canisters. These products fit solidly into the emerging markets for specialized high-performance computing at the edge. 
 
The more data input, GPU compute acceleration and flash-based storage resources available to a server, the faster it can acquire, process, store, and retrieve data. In cases where the amount of these resources does not fit within the constraints of a conventional server, PCIe is used to disaggregate the resources into a multi-chassis solution. We have built leading edge expertise in PCIe expansion technology and leverage it to design and build systems that offer a high quantity and density of GPU compute acceleration, flash storage and data I/O interfaces. 
 
A key element of our product strategy is technological leadership. We believe a first-to-market strategy is key to our ability to continue to win significant OEM opportunities. As a result, we continue to develop new state-of-the-art products providing first-to-market next-generation PCIe based building blocks and systems. Our ability to drive the leading edge of technology is enabled by our strong relationships with strategic component manufactures, including NVIDIA (for GPUs), Western Digital and Micron (for flash memory); Broadcom (for PCIe switch components), Mellanox (for networking) and Intel, AMD and Marvel (for CPUs). In many of these cases, OSS has access to product roadmaps and other technical information relating to future technology. Access to this information allows us to begin our design process well before the

These industry sectors expect to deploy increasingly faster computing systems to meet industry and competitive goals. GPU computer acceleration, high-performance flash storage and data acquisition are key subsets of the high-performance computing market. 
 
GPU Compute Acceleration 
 
The capabilities and speed of GPU accelerated computers are driving significant advances in AI and machine learning. Massive amounts of data are being collected, stored and analyzed by today’s sophisticated algorithms.   AI and machine learning are poised to transform worldwide business, as advances in computing speed and storage come together to enable businesses to solve complex problems. OSS is enabling the move of this AI capability from centralized datacenters to deployments closer to the data sources at the edge.
High Density Solid-State Storage 
 
The market for flash memory based on solid-state storage systems is large and growing. According to a study by Markets and Markets, the all-flash storage server market is growing at 25% per year, and is expected to reach $18 billion by 2023. The proliferation of larger and larger data sets used in HPC and AI are feeding the need for higher capacity and higher performance storage devices. 
 
Traditionally, companies have used hard disk drives for their primary storage.  Hard drive-based systems are being replaced by flash memory based systems which offer higher capacity, performance, reliability and ruggedness.  Flash-based storage systems also consume significantly less power. 
 
Flash-based storage systems are especially useful for high performance computing applications, which deal with large amounts of data and the need for complex calculations to be completed in real time. In these applications, speed and efficiency are paramount. Military systems, for example, collect vast amounts of data using sensor systems, cameras, radar systems, and a myriad of other real-world inputs. This data needs to be collected, stored, analyzed and acted upon in a real-time environment. 
 
High Speed Data Acquisition
 
At the front end of these systems is high speed data acquisition technology. Depending on the application, the data can be generated from a wide array of sensors. In the case of autonomous vehicles, data is generated through arrays of video, LIDAR and radar sensors. In battlefield applications cameras, radar, sonar, FLIR (infrared), and RF sensors are deployed. Medical applications use MRI or CT sensors. In security applications, networks of security cameras produce high volumes of video data. Industrial automation includes telemetry data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and video feeds at a wide spectrum of frame rates.
 6

Although data rates vary for all of these applications based on the sensors or array of sensors deployed, the fundamental requirements for the ingest subsystem is that it supports high speed data rates, does not allow loss of data, and does not impose flow control on the sensor data stream. For many AI on the Fly applications, local data rates can be extremely high, requiring specialized PCIe data capture hardware. As part of the capture process, the data is often processed in real time to be formatted in a useable form prior to movement to the storage devices. Capture hardware can be in the form of PCIe FPGAs, video capture, frame grabbers, or smart NICs performing a range of functions including tagging, encoding, sorting, and analog to digital conversion, filtering, time stamping, and channel synchronization. 
 
Key Components of Our Business 
 
Product Development 
 
Our systems are built using the latest GPU and flash storage technologies and draw upon years of expertise in designing and manufacturing semi-custom systems for OEMs. We have a history of being first-to-market with many solutions for emerging technologies. When PCIe was introduced in 2005, we were the first company to produce PCIe over cable adapters allowing system-to-system communication at same speed as internal I/O expansion. Similarly, in 2018, we introduced the first PCIe Gen 4.0 cable adapters, and in 2019, introduced the first PCIe Gen 4.0 system building blocks and platforms. PCIe Gen 4.0’s ultra-high performance 16.0 GT/s (giga-transfers/second) and signal integrity challenges limits the number of players in this market and creates barriers of entry.  Today, we are one of the largest providers of PCIe adapters and expansion components used worldwide. 
 
When GPU technology and solid-state flash were first introduced, we began designing systems that maximized the effectiveness of these technologies. We now produce compute systems with large numbers of GPUs and flash memory communicating over PCIe to allow faster processing and data storage and retrieval. The more GPUs and flash devices available to a server, the faster that system can process and store data. 
 
We use leading edge, state-of-the art components from major technology providers to design purpose-built systems that solve customer problems in an efficient, cost-effective manner. We apply the component technology provided by Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital, Broadcom and others to deliver customer driven designs to provide true value to our customers. 
 
Worldwide Sales 
 
We provide our products on a worldwide basis and are supported through a network of reseller and distribution partners. Sales in North America and Europe are predominately driven by our direct sales force, whereas Asian sales are driven through distributors.

Our Opportunity 
 
The worldwide high-performance computing market is expected to grow from $39 billion in 2019 to $50 billion by 2023. (Grandview research, “Edge Computing Market Size” June 2019) Within this market, OSS is positioned in the highest performance and fastest growing portions of the specialized edge computing market including the customer server, GPU accelerators, storage (flash arrays) and PCIe data acquisition and expansion sectors. 
Custom Built Servers 
 
Within the server sector, OSS has secured a niche position of building purpose-built specialty servers, which the major server suppliers choose not to supply as they require custom tuning and special features that major OEMs cannot easily provide. Such flexibility is difficult to maintain for major suppliers because their systems are not designed to reflect specific customer specifications. OSS on the other hand has continued to find efficient ways to service this market.  For example, OSS designs and builds a custom server with custom connectors and 16 high-definition video media outputs that are used in the entertainment industry to provide multimedia at live performances. 
GPU Compute Accelerators 
 
GPU computing uses hardware components that are optimized to perform mathematical calculations in a rapid fashion. NVIDIA is the market leader in the design and manufacturing of these components.  OSS works closely with NVIDIA to design and build systems which use multiple GPUs to accelerate applications. 
 
Markets and applications such as artificial intelligence, image rendering and processing, autonomous vehicles, deep learning, molecular modeling, genomics, advanced visualization, machine learning, and image processing, all benefit from the ability to use GPUs to accelerate the application. OSS builds specialized compute accelerators, using the latest GPU technology, to attach to traditional servers used in these emerging growth markets. We estimate these markets to be very large and growing.  Because our strategy has been to be first-to-market with the fastest and densest compute accelerator appliances, we anticipate our addressable market to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 
We also have a strong position in the government market which, according to Intersect360, constitutes 25% of the market resulting in projected revenue of $13 billion by 2023. OSS products can form a basis for companies who wish to participate in the hyper-scale market, which includes deep learning and AI. This is a major technology trend that OSS is addressing. Intersect360 estimates the deep learning market was worth more than $8 billion in 2018 with projections to grow to over $28 billion by 2023, according to Kenneth Research dated August 2019.
 
All Flash Arrays 
 
We build standard and custom flash storage arrays to customer specifications utilizing our unique know-how in PCIe device fan-out, packaging, cooling, and PCIe-over-cable. We deliver dense, high-performance systems that provide customers with high value and utility in the most demanding, data-intensive operations. 
 
Through a strategic agreement with Western Digital, we acquired the software engineering team several years back and the appropriate source code license for the Ion flash array software.  This provides OSS flash arrays with a high level of differentiation relating to storage management, latency and throughput. We provide standard flash array products and have the in-house hardware and software expertise to provide customized systems for demanding applications that are not suitable for standard offerings. 
 
For example, we provide products to a large military contractor for integration into military aircraft that required us to design and manufacture a highly ruggedized mil-spec flash array. The resulting product provides high data density with low weight and a high degree of portability and security for the data. We believe our experience and capability in high speed, low-latency, digital signaling via PCIe gives us an edge in providing these custom designs to OEMs, military programs and other special purpose applications. 
 10

The overall market for flash arrays is growing rapidly. According to Markets and Markets All-Flash Array Market – Global Forecast to 2023 published in February 2019, the flash storage market totaled $6 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to reach $18 billion by 2023. According to Intersect360 about 80% of the total sales in 2018 were attributed to traditional large OEMs, like Dell EMC, NetApp, HPE, Hitachi, Lenovo, DDN and IBM. The remaining 20% is addressed by many smaller flash storage providers, including OSS. We believe that because our products are positively differentiated by speed, density, and management features for challenging edge applications, our offerings compete favorably in this market and provide a substantial growth opportunity. 
 
Since we develop custom flash storage arrays, we work closely with both OEMs and end users to insure they receive the product they want in the specific configuration, size and weight required for their application. We believe this gives OSS an advantageous position in a market that is growing rapidly and allows us to favorably compete in the market. 
 PCIe Data Acquisition Expansion and Adaptors 
 
PCIe is the high-speed standard for communications within a computer. This standard defines the signals and connectors (i.e. slots) that are used for computer add-in cards (such as Ethernet or graphics). Traditionally, communication between computers in the network is done via Ethernet.  Although Ethernet is great for large networks, this introduces delays and latency challenges.  To keep performance at the highest level, PCIe signaling can also be routed over a cable, allowing expansion input/output slots to be physically located in a separate chassis. This provides for the high performance and low latency which are essential in this market.
 
Being able to separate the server from the I/O expansion, using PCIe over a cable, facilitates disaggregation of server functionality. That is, with PCIe, server I/O functions no longer need to be contained in the physical server chassis, but can instead be separated into a separate chassis and continue to operate at full speed. This offers many advantages over higher latency and power consuming traditional networking communications like Ethernet.  From a practical perspective, servers can be connected directly to larger storage arrays or other peripheral devices, with the resulting group of chassis operating as if they were all in the same physical chassis. 
 
We began developing our first PCIe-over-cable adaptor in 2006, and were one of the early providers of PCIe adaptors. We recognized this as prime opportunity to utilize our core strengths, such as: 
 
 
• | High-speed board design and layout
--+-----------------------------------


• | Signal integrity masters
--+-------------------------


• | Hardware tuning to improve signal integrity
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Design optimization for low cost
--+---------------------------------


• | Rapid design capability
--+------------------------


• | Manufacturing and supply chain management
--+------------------------------------------

 
This technology has now become a standard within the computer industry, and OSS customers have used our adaptors to connect their custom input/output chassis and achieve performance equivalence as if the input/output was integrated into the server box. This gives designers and integrators a degree of flexibility and utility in architecting computer systems that is unprecedented. For example, one of our customers has utilized PCIe-over-cable to connect its high-performance video editing systems to a host computer, providing a system that is optimized for an application using standard servers. We have expanded our PCIe adaptor market in breadth and depth, including making adaptors for many OEM customers. To date, we have shipped more than 100,000 PCIe adaptor cards to customers globally. 
 
With our expertise developed in designing adaptor cards, the logical extension of our capability led us to develop a method for expanding the PCIe bus into an external chassis containing one or many expansion slots. This allowed a customer to install multiple standard PCIe boards into a chassis and expand their system without having to add additional servers. A user could now connect a multiplicity of PCIe devices to a single server, and achieve performance throughput and low latency that was not possible prior to the introduction of PCIe.
 11

We have been a leader in PCIe expansion backplanes and chassis through generations 1, 2, 3, and 4. As PCIe evolves through generations 5 and 6, we are uniquely positioned to continue our leadership role in this market. We have introduced a full line of PCIe Gen 4.0 products and will once again take a leadership role with PCIe Gen 5.0 when the specification is complete which is anticipated in 2021. We currently offer what we believe to be the largest PCIe expansion product line breadth, with chassis and backplanes that offer expansion from one to 64 slots. Due to its greater data throughput and flexibility of design, we believe this is a growing market, and we intend to maintain our leadership role. 
 
Our Technology 
 
We design and manufacture high performance computing systems for use on the edge that increase compute performance while reducing cost and impact to the infrastructure. Our high-density compute accelerators connect directly to a server’s PCIe bus, delivering substantial compute performance. Our flash storage arrays support hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage that can also be accessed by multiple servers. 
 
Technology Drivers for OSS High-Performance Computing Business 
 
OSS has developed expertise and core competencies in the three fundamental technology drivers of today’s high-performance edge computing market. Namely, high-speed serial interconnect technology, compute acceleration utilizing GPUs, and low latency flash storage. In combination, these technologies are changing the economics of computing, bringing high-performance computing within the grasp of a wide range of new industries and commercial applications on the edge. Simultaneously the emergence of massive data being generated in each of these industries is pushing the requirement for state-of-the-art technology.

Switched Serial Interconnect 
 
Switched serial interconnects are the data highways connecting many elements of today’s high-performance computing platforms. At ever increasing speeds, these pathways move data between system’s processing units, storage, networking, and peripheral elements. For high performance computing the primary processing, storage and peripheral interconnect is PCIe Gen 4.0. PCIe Gen 4.0 has an ability to run up to 16 lanes in parallel, which allows up to 64 gigabytes (full duplex) per second bandwidth between system elements. 
 
Serial switches incorporated in system design allow many system elements to be connected together in a non-blocking interconnect fabric at PCIe Gen 4 speeds. This switch fabric capability allows systems to scale internally avoiding bottlenecks. The serial interconnect can be embedded directly in the computer printed circuit boards, across connectors board-to-board, or traverse across copper or optical cables for chassis-to-chassis connection. Due to the extremely high speeds, the design considerations around signal integrity are rigorous and with unforgiving tolerances. PCIe Gen 5 will begin deployment in 2021, doubling the interconnect speed once again. 
 
Compute Acceleration with GPUs
 
GPUs have evolved from graphics display acceleration to becoming general-purpose processing workhorses for high-performance computing systems. Today, the majority of the fastest supercomputers in the world utilize GPUs as their primary compute engines. GPUs are ideal for high-performance computing workloads because of their ability to do massively parallel processing. While traditional CPUs today may have dozens of processing cores, GPUs have thousands of cores that are able to execute calculations simultaneously. 
 
For many high-performance applications, fundamental pieces of the code can be optimized to run in parallel and therefore experience significant performance enhancements. NVIDIA, a key supplier of GPUs to the market, has done extensive benchmarking showing the ability of single GPU based machines to exceed the performance of dozens or even thousands of traditional CPU-only computers. NVIDIA has worked extensively with the software development community, and hundreds of applications have been tuned and developed to run on GPUs.

While NVIDIA is focused on the deployment of their GPUs in the Data Center and for gaming, OSS is focused on taking this capability to the edge.   Many of these applications also scale performance based on the number of GPU components utilized. OSS has designed multi-GPU systems including up to 16 GPUs in a single system. Current state-of-the art GPUs provide over 7 teraflops of performance, with future products set to dramatically increase overall processing capabilities in the years to come. 
 
GPUs also pose significant system design challenges due to their high-power requirements. High-end GPUs can require as much as 350 watts of power, which generates a tremendous amount of heat. Sophisticated power distribution and cooling designs are required, especially for large scale systems with multiple GPUs per chassis. 
 
PCI Express Flash Storage – NVMe protocol
 
The use of flash memory technology for system storage has gained traction over the last several years, as the cost per gigabyte has continued to drop. Flash memory is now becoming the ubiquitous storage technology in high-performance systems. 
 
Combined with the move away from traditional rotating hard drive technology has been the trend toward eliminating traditional storage protocols in favor of low latency flash memory protocols. Newer flash memory modules utilize a protocol known as NVMe, which connects the flash memory directly to the system’s PCIe interconnect. This direct connection allows for very high bandwidth between the storage and the other system elements and eliminates the need for protocol translation as data is moved from storage subsystems to and from the compute complex. 
 
Today, flash memory modules with capacities up to 8 terabytes and PCIe Gen 4 interfaces are becoming available. OSS flash storage arrays with hundreds of terabytes of capacity are available, enabling the scaling of high-speed storage to meet the full range of high-performance edge application requirements. 
 
Core Technical Capabilities 
 
OSS has developed unique expertise and core competency across the fundamental technologies of today’s rapidly expanding specialized high-performance edge computing marketplace. These valuable assets are embedded in the leading-edge engineering capabilities of our engineers, the proprietary intellectual property residing in our vast library of designs, and our brand equity based on our reputation as a high-quality producer of state-of-the-art custom and standard solutions across a broad array of markets.

High Speed System Interconnect Design 
 
Our electrical engineers are experts in high-speed digital signaling design. They have continually designed at the leading edge of the state-of-the-art signaling speeds, as semiconductor technology has driven up the clock rate of digital transmission. We have consistently been among a small handful of companies able to come to market first with the latest technology. In fact, we delivered the industry’s first PCIe over cable solutions for PCIe Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, and Gen 4 and are currently on track to accomplish this again in Gen 5. The expertise required includes circuit design, PCB (printed circuit board) layout and routing optimizations all with a focus on achieving the highest levels of signal integrity. In our current systems, PCIe Gen 4 signals are propagated across multiple PCBs, connectors, and copper cabling while maintaining the ability to recognize digital signal transitions at 16 billion times per second. 
 
In high-performance computing systems, especially on the edge, the trajectory of ever-increasing signaling speeds is continuing.   An ever-shrinking set of companies have the capability to design robust, highly-reliable systems at speeds that can tolerate the harsh conditions on the edge. We believe our core competency in large-scale, high-speed design and layout will allow us to remain on the forefront of this growing industry. 
 Complex System Design 
 
In addition to low-level signal integrity design expertise, we have amassed expertise and intellectual property in high-performance system architecture design. This expertise allows us to develop extremely sophisticated systems with massive scaling, while meeting customer demands for reliability, cost, and flexibility. 
 
We have developed the deep knowledge for high-capacity input/output systems and operating system adjustments and configuration tuning required. Our engineers are often called upon to co-design with OEM designers to create the perfect fit solution for their customers. 
 
For highly scalable systems, a deep understanding and experience with switching topologies and interconnect fabric design is required. We have worked with serial switching technology starting with the first generation of PCIe and have been an innovator in creating unique and flexible topologies to meet the specific needs of the customers. Creating custom solutions for unique customer solutions is a core competency and relies on this deep knowledge of switch capabilities and limitations. 
 
For maximum system performance, design for optimizing data transfer speeds is also an important consideration. OSS has developed expertise in system design to leverage peer-to-peer data flows between GPUs and pioneering techniques for optimized data flows between flash storage and GPU compute engines. Our systems optimize switch and GPU configuration topologies to optimize GPU-to-GPU communication without requiring latency-inducing data transfer between host dual processors. Our platforms feature RDMA (remote direct memory access) across compute nodes, which support data transfer without burdening the host CPU. 
 
OSS has pioneered the ability to extend the PCIe bus beyond the confines of a single enclosure, opening the possibility of flexible system expansion options. We believe we are one of the leading designers and suppliers of PCIe host bus adapters that extend PCIe signals from the host motherboard across copper or optical cables to expansion enclosures. OSS adapters provide both ends of the external cable connection. Our expertise in high-speed signal design in printed circuit boards, connectors and cables is essential to successful expansion designs. We also hold expertise in incorporating clustering and rack scale expansion into our system designs, including 100/200 gigabit Ethernet, 100/200 gigabit InfiniBand, and emerging PCIe top-of-rack switch technology. 
 
Expertise in power, cooling, and mechanical design are required to address the requirements of the high-performance computing customers especially while meeting the constrained time requirements of edge deployments. We have developed leadership design capability in high-power design and distribution within large rack enclosures as well as edge optimized configurations. High-end GPUs today require 350 watts or above, and in our high-end systems, up to 16 of these can reside in a single chassis. Thousands of kilowatts of redundant power are required. Power stability and huge thermal loads are some of the critical design issues that must be addressed. 
 
We have expertise in power distribution, redundant power, and complex chassis cooling design, including materials selection, airflow simulation, fan technology and cable routing. We have also developed extensive intellectual property in regulatory compliance of complex high-performance computing system design across emission, shock, vibration, thermal, humidity and other environmental requirements that are required for highly reliable and highly available solutions. OSS engineers are experts in design for regulatory testing for FCC (Federal Communications Commission), CE (European 
 14

Conformity), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), and Mil-Spec (Military Standard) standards. Additionally, we have expertise in rapid prototyping, design for manufacturability, and design for serviceability. 
 
Storage Management Software 
 
Given our hardware design and integration expertise, we see the next natural step is to add a robust software capability that will allow us to offer more optimized and customized systems. Our Ion software design team provides the expertise to deliver full server and storage solutions that produce the highest performance from today’s leading-edge flash storage devices. 
 
The Ion software allows flash-based modules to be put into a variety of storage and network configurations which can then be accessed by multiple servers. The Ion software can do this cost-effectively, while preserving the low latency that is vital for many business and mission-critical enterprise applications, from database and transaction processing to massive data collection programs. Ion also has a full high-availability option to ensure complete data integrity.

Competition 
 
OSS’ core business is to provide specialized high-performance edge computing building blocks and platforms to OEMs who incorporate these products in their complete solutions which they sell to end users in specific vertical markets.  Due to the nature of OSS’ business there are a number of categories of potential competitors of our products.
 
Customer in-house design resources 
 
Many of OSS’ target OEM customers have in-house engineering design resources which could be used as an alternative to engaging with OSS.  Examples of current OSS customers who have significant in-house resources include National Instruments, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin. This potential competition is mitigated by the technical specialization OSS has especially in high end and large scale PCI Express switch fabrics and PCI Express over cable capabilities.  OEMs can invest their in-house resources on value-add capabilities within their specific vertical market and outsource these horizontal technology capabilities to OSS.  OSS has also developed a trusted partner relationship with many of these OEMs 
 17

and has established a market reputation for technical expertise and a responsive and cost-effective engagement model. We win when our customers realize that together we can produce better products faster and more cost-effectively than they can themselves. This has proven to be particularly evident when customers require state-of-the-art products that are constructed of parts available commercially. This has resulted in several design wins that demonstrate our flexibility and how we can work closely with large OEM and government customers. Interestingly, it appears that when these large companies cut back on their workforce or have more limited budgets, such events may actually help our position as we may become these companies’ only option to get their desired product or service deployed within a reasonable period of time.
 Major Tier 1 & 2 Mainstream Computer and Storage Vendors
 
These vendors offer mainstream high-performance computing platforms including servers and storage systems that can address some applications at the edge in OSS target markets. They do not; however, offer ‘specialized’ platforms or customization capabilities that OSS specializes in to meet unique form factor or ruggedization or scale out requirements sought by OEM customers.  For the most part these vendors focus on the large air-conditioned data centers and compete on price/volume.  OSS’ strategy is specifically designed to avoid head-to-head competition with this class of vendors.  In some scenarios OSS can provide a complementary specialized component or building block which interface to one of these vendors mainstream products. Examples of companies in this space include HP, Dell/EMC, IBM, Pure Storage, and NetApp.
 
Chip Vendors with vertical integration offerings
 
Third party competitive products include cases where the manufacturers of the underlying chip or board-level products decide to also offer system-level products. This is the case with Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital and others. These offerings tend to be tactical, short-term products that are intended to demonstrate a new technology, rather than long-term forays into the systems business. In addition, these “technology demonstration systems” tend to be priced at high levels, making them less competitive once the newness factor wears off. 
 
Specialized Horizontal HPC Vendors
 
There are a handful of fragmented competitors who offer specialized products in the same categories as OSS.  These companies are small and tend to focus in specific geographic area or with an established set of long-term customers.  They have limited bandwidth to take on many simultaneous projects and are rarely seen in direct competitive situations. Examples of companies in this space include Trenton and Cyclone.
Multi GPU Platform Vendors
 
A significant area of focus for OSS is in specialized multi-GPU platforms for edge applications.  Due to the tremendous interest in AI solutions using GPUs there are many vendors offering products in this space.  Similar to the mainstream computer and storage vendors mentioned above these vendors offer standard solutions without the options for specialization and customization that OSS offers. As the primary GPU vendor, NVIDIA is a safe choice as a system provider for many customers who do not need or desire a level of specialization in their products.  OSS has a strong and positive relationship with NVIDIA which includes receiving leads from them for specialized solutions not addressed by their mainstream system offering.  Other companies such as SuperMicro and Tyan who offer their own system products directly are also happy to work with OSS to resell their products when customers need a combination of standard and specialized products.  OSS offers its EOS server based on SuperMicro motherboards. Examples of companies in this space include NVIDIA, SuperMicro and Tyan.
 
Vertical HPC Vendors – Military/Aerospace
 
In certain vertical markets, there are competitors who focus primarily in that market. The military and aerospace markets are prime examples.  These vendors often provide complete solutions including both hardware and software and some specialization in terms of form factor and ruggedization.  In these markets, OSS provides unique capability in terms of scaling of PCI Express components over cable (copper and fiber) that can address unique requirements of specific military or government programs.  OSS has also established good relationships with prime contractors or agencies (Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, NASA, ONR, and others) which can be important influencers or decision makers on technology selection.  Competitors in this space include companies such as Mercury, Crystal, Curtiss Wright, and Systel.  In the past, we have been able to offer the latest technology normally only deployed in commercial applications well before our competitors by leveraging our “performance, without compromise” strategy. 
 18


Vertical Vendors – M&E/Visualization
 
Another vertical market with different competitors is the media and entertainment and visualization markets.  These companies focus on understanding and tuning their hardware systems to the specific application and data types of these markets.  This focus provides those benefits in terms of brand awareness in the vertical, but often they are limited in ability to meet specialized and customized requirements of OEMs in this space.  Examples of companies in this space include Boxx, Cubix and Sonnet.
Manufacturing and Operations 
 
OSS is certified under ISO 9001-2015 for “design, manufacture, and supply of industrial computers.” This means OSS has demonstrated its ability to consistently provide products that meet both customer requirements and applicable regulatory or statutory requirements. It also indicates that we have programs and processes in place to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, as well as a continuous improvement program that ensures OSS gets better over time. 
 
We utilize lean principles to drive our manufacturing and assembly process. One of the key aspects of this is our application of just-in-time principles that ensure effective ordering and utilization of inventory, and this helps optimize cash flow throughout the manufacturing cycle. Within the manufacturing process, our operations encompass three categories of “builds:” 
 
 
• | Standard Builds – These are builds of standard products that are sold with little or no customization or non-standard features. These are products that are ready to be installed or integrated by the customer upon receipt.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Builds – Custom builds involve a product built to a customer specification. Upon receipt, the customer has a unique product that performs all the functions and has the physical dimensions that match their specifications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering Project Builds – OSS supports the product development process by building models and prototypes of products. Developed by the OSS engineering group, the prototypes can be of standard or custom products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
OSS is dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction. Within the manufacturing operations function at OSS, our processes begin with the end goal in mind. This means we start with the customer. All our business processes begin with the idea that the customer is the essence of why we exist. Our continuous improvement efforts require us to review products, services, and processes with the idea that minor changes can lead to greater outcomes for our customers. 
 
While we are cognizant of the additive nature of small improvements, we believe a disciplined approach to improvement sometime leads to extraordinary, large, and positive advances in our products and services. This is extremely important to OSS, as our goal is to bring the most advanced leading-edge technologies to our customers before our competitors can. Our operations strategy supports our overall mission of being first-to-market with customized, leading-edge products that are best-in-market in terms of speed and overall performance. 
 
Although we serve the high end of the edge computing space, we are constantly looking for ways to become more efficient and drive down costs while driving up margins.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our ability to compete successfully in our industry is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in order to drive further commercialization. We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology.
 
Intellectual property research and development at OSS is centered on the exploitation of key technologies as they evolve in the marketplace. Our product roadmap reflects new technologies for CPUs, GPUs, flash storage, and advanced PCIe switches. We design first-to-market, custom implementations utilizing market leading component technologies. Accordingly, our focus lies not in the capital-intensive development of silicon implementations of technologies (i.e., chips, processors, GPUs, or storage devices), but rather leverages leading-edge technologies and building first-to-market products that fully exploit those technologies for solving customer problems. 
 19


The OSS research and development strategy can be summarized as follows: OSS drives design wins by utilizing key new technologies to develop products that are leading edge and first-to-market while solving challenging problems working closely with our customers.
 
Some examples of OSS developments: 
  
• | GPU compute accelerators with the most GPUs per rack unit
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Networking of GPUs
--+-------------------


• | Broad range of solutions, due to specific customer design
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Capability to expand existing servers from virtually any OEM
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | First-to-market products as new GPUs are introduced by NVIDIA, Intel, Western Digital and Broadcom
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete customization per the needs of our OEM customers
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Integration of multiple new technologies (servers, GPUs, flash drives, and PCIe) into optimized products for our OEM customers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 
The primary intellectual property value of OSS emanates from the more than 600 individual design projects we have undertaken over the decades since our founding. These designs are archived and cataloged, so we rarely begin a new design from scratch.  In general, we maintain the rights to the product to use elsewhere.
 
Over the years, our team has developed and maintained expertise in high-speed signal design and analysis, electronic and mechanical packaging, PCIe-over-cable, fiber optics transmission, high-speed/density flash arrays, and integration and deployment of GPUs in compute accelerators and servers. This extensive expertise positions us to expand and rationalize our product line to meet the growing and ever-changing HPC market. 
 
Working Capital Items
 
Our inventory levels are currently adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of demand.  We consider the component parts of our different products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. 
Markets, Seasonality, and Major Customers
 
The Company’s products and services serve a global clientele consisting of multinational companies, governmental agencies, and leading technology providers. Based on recent market experience, it appears there may be some seasonality with deliveries decreasing in January and February each year, likely as a result of Asia’s holiday season and as a result of varied customer appropriation cycles; however, we believe these market factors will continue to evolve and the Company’s insight to these trends will improve with continued commercial success and time.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, 24.1% and 41.0% of our total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with two customers. A loss or decline in business with these customers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We typically provide our products under contract supply agreements or purchase orders. We provide our products, software, and services from our offices located in California, Utah, and Germany.  
 
Distribution, Marketing, and Strategic Relationships
 
We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including distribution and manufacturing. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on North America, Europe and Asia markets, through our direct product sales force, and partner networks.
 20

Materials and Suppliers
 
Although most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources, we believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. 
 
Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor have we experienced a significant price increase for materials or components.  We do not anticipate any such delays or significant price increases in our fiscal year 2021. 
 Human Capital Resources, Employees, and Personnel 
 We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel.  To achieve this objective the Company provides competitive compensation, benefits, stock participation and a success driven work environment.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 99 employees, of which 97 are full-time and 2 are part-time employees.  Seventy-three of our employees are domestic and twenty-six are international. Our employees include highly skilled engineers, technicians, assemblers, and support staff. They are housed in multiple facilities, and are led by a management team that is supportive but expects a lot. We are proud of our low turnover of personnel where we keep the team challenged and encourage input and creative thinking by all.  The management team provides transparency to its employees through regular communication meetings designed to update employees on current metric driven results and future expectations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. 
 Environmental Matters
 
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls.  Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. 
 Furthermore, we do not believe that compliance with existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position, financial position, or any of our operations.  However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 
 Government Approval and Effect of Government Regulations
 Because our core business is to provide specialized high performance edge computing building blocks and platforms to OEMs who incorporate these products in their complete solutions which they sell to end users in specific vertical markets, we do not believe that any government agency approval is required for the products and services that we provide to our customers.
 However, governmental regulations, including but not limited to import and export law, customer, and trade regulations, may affect our business.  For more information, see the section titled, “Risk Factors” found on Part I, Item1A, to this Annual Report.
