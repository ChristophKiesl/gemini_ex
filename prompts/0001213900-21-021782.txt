Item 1. Business
 
Nxt-ID provides technology products and services for healthcare applications. We have extensive experience in access control, biometric and behavior-metric identity verification, security and privacy, encryption and data protection, payments, miniaturization, and sensor technologies and healthcare applications.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary LogicMark, LLC (“LogicMark”) operated in the mobile market: LogicMark is a manufacturer and distributor of non-monitored and monitored personal emergency response systems (“PERS”) that are sold through dealers, distributors and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (the “VA”).
 
Healthcare
 
Overview
 
With respect to the healthcare market, our business initiatives are driven by LogicMark, which serves a market that enables two-way communication, medical device connectivity and patient data tracking of key vitals through sensors, biometrics, and security to make home health care a reality. There are four (4) major trends driving this market: (1) an increased desire for connectivity; specifically, a greater desire for connected devices by people over 60 years of age who now represent the fastest growing demographic for social media; (2) the growth of “TeleHealth”, which is the means by which telecommunications technologies are meeting the increased need for health systems to better distribute doctor care across a wider range of health facilities, making it easier to treat and diagnose patients; (3) rising healthcare costs – as healthcare spending continues to outpace the economy, the need to reduce hospital readmissions, increase staffing efficiency and improve patient engagement remain the highest priorities; and (4) the critical shortage of labor in the home healthcare industry, creating an increased need for technology to improve communication to home healthcare agencies by their clients. Together, these trends have produced a large and growing market for us to serve. LogicMark has built a successful business on emergency communications in healthcare. We have a strong business relationship with the VA today, serving veterans who suffer from chronic conditions that often require emergency assistance. Our strategic plan calls for expanding LogicMark’s business into other healthcare verticals as well as retail and enterprise channels in order to better serve the expanding demand for connected and remote healthcare solutions.
 
Home healthcare, is an emerging area for LogicMark. The long-term trend toward more home-based healthcare is a massive shift that is being driven by demographics (an aging population) and basic economics. People also value autonomy and privacy which are important factors in determining which solutions will suit the market. Consumers are beginning to enjoy the benefits of smart home technologies and online digital assistants.

Our Healthcare Monitoring Market Opportunity
 
PERS devices are used to call for help and medical care during an emergency. These devices are also used by a wide patient pool, as well as the general population, to ensure safety and security when living or traveling alone. The global medical alert systems market caters to different end-users across the healthcare industry, including individual users, hospitals and clinics, assisted living facilities and senior living facilities. The growing demand for home healthcare devices is mainly driven by an aging population, rising healthcare costs and a severe shortage of workers in the home healthcare market worldwide. It is very beneficial for seniors who have a history of falling or have been identified as having a high fall risk, older individuals who live alone and people who have mobility issues. We believe that the aging population will spur the usage of medical alert systems across the globe, as they offer safety and medical security while being affordable and accessible.
Global PERS Market Growth
 


Source: Kenneth Research 2020
 
The PERS market is divided into three (3) device segments: landline-based PERS, mobile PERS, and standalone devices. The global PERS market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 5.8% to $4.5 billion in 2028, benefiting from strong demographic tailwinds. As landline usage continues to decrease, other technologies such as cellular and WiFi will be used for in-home systems. According to Kenneth Research, North America, Asia and Europe are the largest markets for PERS, accounting for approximately 37%, 31% and 24% of total sales, respectively, in 2028. According to Kenneth Research, improvements in healthcare infrastructure and emerging economies will fuel growth and significantly improve the relative market share of the rest of world regions.

Our Health Care Products
 
LogicMark produces a range of products within the PERS market and has differentiated itself by offering “no monthly fee” products, which only require a one-time purchase fee, instead of a recurring monthly contract. The “no monthly fee” products contact family, friends or 911 directly, eliminating the monthly fee from a monitoring center.  As a result, we believe LogicMark’s products are typically the most cost-effective PERS option. LogicMark’s non-monitored solution offers a significant value proposition over monitored solutions.
 
The cost of ownership of a monitored solution, which includes a monthly service fee, can be as much as $1,500 – $3,000 over a five-year period. This compares to a one-time purchase of a LogicMark no monthly fee device, which provides a similar level of security for a purchase price as low as one tenth of that amount.
 
LogicMark offers both traditional (i.e., landline) and mPERS (i.e., cell-based) options. Our no monthly fee products are sold primarily through the VA and healthcare distributors.
 


LogicMark offers monitored products that are primarily sold by dealers and distributors for the monitored product channel. LogicMark sells its devices to the dealers and distributors, who in turn offer the devices to consumers as part of their product/service offering. The service providers charge consumers a monthly monitoring fee for the associated monitoring service. These products are monitored by a third-party central station.

Our Health Care Competition
 
LogicMark offers a wide variety of products, enabling it to cater to users with different levels of health and safety needs. Compared to its competitors, we believe LogicMark’s PERS products offer enhanced functionality at the best value due to the one-time purchase for non-monitored solutions.
 
The chart below summarizes LogicMark’s product offering versus those of its competitors:
 


Our Health Care Business Strategy
 
We intend to expand LogicMark’s product distribution by using larger distributors who can leverage the consumer value proposition of offering a one-time device purchase as opposed to a leased monthly solution. We also intend to apply our technology to the next generation of PERS devices that will have greater functionality, innovative design and clinical monitoring capability. We believe that there is further potential for expansion in the domestic and international retail and institutional/senior living markets, and we intend to take advantage of this through a new product offering, Notifi911+, which is a non-monitored device developed for direct-to-consumer sales through retail channels and direct marketing initiatives. We are also seeking to leverage our PERS experience to develop new offerings to serve the home healthcare and senior living markets with WiFi notification services.

Overall, our healthcare division, through LogicMark, is positioned to take advantage of favorable market dynamics, a stable revenue-producing customer base, a differentiated product line, a robust new product development pipeline and compelling growth opportunities.
 
Payments and Financial Technology
 
Overview
 
Between 2017 and 2019, we also conducted a payment credential management business through our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Fit-Pay, Inc. (“Fit Pay”). With the approval of our board of directors, and upon similar terms and conditions to those set forth in that loan agreement, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent for a potential sale of Fit Pay, excluding certain assets on August 6, 2019. In connection with the letter of intent, the purchaser advanced $500,000 of non-interest bearing working capital for Fit Pay. On September 9, 2019, we completed the sale of Fit Pay to Garmin International, Inc. for $3.32 million in cash. After the closing of the sale of our Fit Pay business, we terminated conducting any further business related to payment credential management.
Our Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information.

We enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and key employees, and maintain control over access to and distribution of our technology, software and other proprietary information. The steps that we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us.
 
We do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes on the patents that are held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.

We may face claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights in the future. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
