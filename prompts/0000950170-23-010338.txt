 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a development-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic product for the acute treatment of migraine. Our product candidate, STS101, is a drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate, or DHE, which is designed to be quickly and easily self-administered with a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant advantages over other therapeutics for many patients. However, broad use has been limited by invasive and burdensome administration and/or sub-optimal clinical performance of available injectable and liquid nasal spray products. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming these shortcomings. If we can timely secure a strategic transaction partner to continue development of STS101, and if such potential transaction partner can obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize STS101, we believe STS101 has the potential to be an important and differentiated option for the acute treatment of migraine that can address the unmet needs of many people living with migraines.
 In January 2023, we completed our STS101 clinical development program in which a total of more than 1,600 subjects have treated more than 10,000 migraine attacks with STS101. The STS101 clinical development program included multiple Phase 1 clinical trials, two Phase 3 placebo-controlled efficacy trials (the EMERGE and SUMMIT trials) and a long-term, open-label safety trial (the ASCEND trial). We believe the results of our STS101 clinical development program are supportive of the efficacy and safety of STS101. We have also worked to establish, in collaboration with our contract manufacturing partners, the ability to manufacture commercial quantities of STS101 utilizing proprietary processes, custom mold tooling that we own, and custom, automated filling, assembly and packaging equipment that we own.
In May 2022, we completed meetings with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to our clinical data and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) for our planned new drug application (NDA) for STS101. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss and confirm required nonclinical, clinical and CMC content of the STS101 NDA. In November 2022, we announced topline results from our STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 efficacy trial showing numerical differences in favor of STS101 versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at the two-hour post-administration timepoint. However, these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p-value <0.05). In addition, we announced that we do not plan to invest in commercializing STS101 and that we will actively explore alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, while minimizing cash expenditures.
 In January 2023, we completed our STS101 ASCEND Phase 3 long-term, open-label safety trial. During the course of the trial, more than 446 subjects treated more than 9,000 attacks with more than 10,500 doses of STS101, with some subjects treating their migraines with STS101 for up to 18 months. STS101 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the ASCEND trial, consistent with clinical experience to date.
 In March 2023, we filed an NDA for STS101 with the FDA, and if the FDA accepts the NDA for substantive review, we anticipate the FDA action date for the STS101 NDA will be in January 2024. As has been our longstanding plan, we are seeking FDA approval of STS101 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway that allows us to reference some of the information required for STS101 approval from studies not conducted by Satsuma. Based on written feedback provided to us by the FDA, we believe the results of our completed Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical trials and our ASCEND Phase 3 long-term safety trial are sufficient, in combination with information referenced from studies not conducted by Satsuma, to support FDA approval of STS101.
The FDA has communicated to us in multiple meetings that a pivotal efficacy trial, such as the STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which we completed and announced results from in November 2022, is not required for approval of STS101, as the efficacy of STS101 may be established via a “pharmacokinetic bridge” to the 505(b)(2) DHE reference products, D.H.E. 45 (DHE injectable solution) and Migranal (DHE liquid nasal spray). The FDA has

also communicated to us that the results of the SUMMIT trial may be considered for inclusion in the STS101 prescribing information if the study is adequate and well-controlled and has results supportive of efficacy. We believe that the SUMMIT trial was adequate and well-controlled and that the results from the trial provide a totality of evidence that is supportive of the efficacy of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine, despite STS101 not having demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo on the co-primary endpoints at the two-hour post-administration timepoint. We further believe that STS101 can address unmet needs of many people with migraine, and that the results of the SUMMIT trial, if included in the prescribing information for STS101, if approved by FDA, would provide important treatment information to physicians and patients.
 The clinical portion of our STS101 NDA is supported primarily by clinical trial results, generated with investigational product that incorporates our second-generation, nasal delivery device, from (i) the Phase 1 comparative PK study of STS101 that we completed in June 2021; and (ii) the STS101 Phase 3 ASCEND long-term, open-label safety trial that we completed in January 2023.
 We believe our second-generation nasal device, which we introduced into the then-ongoing ASCEND trial in January 2021, in conjunction with improved instructions for STS101 use and training of subjects in our clinical trials, effectively addressed the under-delivery issue first identified with our first-generation delivery device shortly following our announcement of results from the EMERGE Phase 3 efficacy trial in September 2020. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe the data in our NDA support approval of STS101 incorporating this second-generation delivery device.
 Phase 1 comparative PK trial
 The Phase 1 PK trial completed in June 2021 compared the DHE blood plasma levels (or PK profiles) of STS101 with the PK profiles of the DHE reference products D.H.E. 45 (DHE injectable solution) administered via intramuscular injection and Migranal (DHE liquid nasal spray). Based on our analyses of the results of this study and our communications with FDA, we believe this Phase 1 PK study establishes the pharmacokinetic bridge to the DHE reference products that is required by FDA to support the filing and potential approval of the STS101 NDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
 ASCEND Phase 3 long-term, open-label safety trial
 The key objective of the ASCEND trial was to demonstrate the local nasal safety of STS101, administered repeatedly over time, in the acute treatment of migraine, so as to fulfill the safety exposure requirements previously communicated to us by the FDA, i.e., at least 150 subjects completing six months of treatment with STS101 and potentially at least 50 subjects completing 12 months of treatment, using investigational product incorporating our second-generation STS101 delivery device. Our STS101 NDA includes interim safety results from the STS101 ASCEND trial for more than 150 subjects who completed at least six months of treatment with STS101 incorporating the second-generation nasal delivery device. Based on our communications with FDA, we do not believe additional long-term safety exposure data is necessary to support an NDA filing and potential approval. However, provided we don’t sooner decide to terminate the STS101 development program and pursue other strategic alternatives such as dissolution and wind-down, we plan to submit additional final safety data from the ASCEND trial to the NDA as part of the 120-Day Safety Update that we are required by statute to be submit to the FDA within four months of the initial NDA submission. The ASCEND trial results we plan to submit to the NDA as part of the 120-Day Safety Update includes safety data for more than 50 subjects who have completed at least 12 months of treatment with STS101 incorporating the second-generation nasal delivery device. In addition, our STS101 NDA includes:
 •Results from the STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial, which randomized approximately 1,600 subjects to either placebo or STS101 investigational product incorporating our second-generation, nasal delivery device. We believe the results of the SUMMIT trial, although negative on the co-primary outcome measures, provide a totality of evidence supporting the effectiveness of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine and, if included in the prescribing information for STS101, if approved, would provide important information to physicians and patients.
 •Results of a previous Phase 1 comparative PK trial and the Phase 3 EMERGE trial that utilized investigational product incorporating an earlier version of our nasal delivery device.


Migraine is a chronic and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by attacks of often severe headache and accompanying neurological symptoms lasting four to 72 hours. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine attacks are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Based on reported prevalence data, approximately 39 million individuals in the United States and over 100 million individuals in Europe suffer from migraine. With a global prevalence of greater than one billion, migraine ranks as the world’s third most prevalent illness, the sixth highest specific cause of disability worldwide, and the leading cause of disability in people under 50 years of age. In addition, migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide in terms of number of years lost to disability. It has been estimated that migraine results in up to $36 billion in healthcare and lost productivity costs and up to 157 million lost workdays annually in the United States. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated illness due to lack of awareness, stigma and the inherent limitations of currently available therapies.
 Acute treatments for migraine are categorized as non-specific therapies, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and migraine-specific therapies, such as triptans, ergot alkaloids (including DHE-based products), oral and liquid nasal spray dosage forms of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists (gepants), and lasmiditan, an oral 5-HT1F agonist (ditan). Lasmiditan and two gepants, ubrogepant and rimegepant, were approved in late 2019 and early 2020 by the FDA, and commercial introductions of these new products in the United States commenced in early 2020. In early 2023, zavegepant, a liquid nasal spray gepant product, was approved by FDA, and we anticipate commercial introduction will commence in 2023.
 The acute migraine prescription market is large and growing at an accelerating rate. In 2022 approximately 19.3 million prescriptions were written in the United States for acute migraine-specific therapies, and prescription volumes for acute migraine-specific therapies grew by 7% versus 2021. This figure excludes prescriptions for non-specific therapies and therefore likely significantly understates the total number of prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans are currently the predominant class of drug for acute treatment of migraine, accounting for approximately 78% of migraine-specific acute therapy prescriptions. However, triptans have been reported to have a number of shortcomings, including that they have inconsistent efficacy across patients and migraine types, require early treatment, cause various side effects, may cause medication overuse headache, or MOH, and have slow and variable onset of action and short duration of effect that necessitates retreatment.
The migraine prescription market growth in 2022 is attributed primarily to the introductions in 2020 of rimegepant and ubrogepant, which together generated approximately $1.4 billion in net sales in the United States in 2022. Ubrogepant and rimegepant have outperformed the initial projections of industry analysts. We believe these trends reflect the large size of the migraine patient population, the significant unmet need among people with migraine for new and improved acute treatments, and the large potential commercial opportunity for such products. In addition, we believe the prospects for continued and sustained market growth are favorable given that migraine is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Further, given that none of the currently available treatment options adequately achieve the American Headache Society’s defined goals for the acute treatment of migraine for a significant percentage of migraine patients, we believe many patients will continue to experience high unmet need and seek new and better treatment options.
 DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine and have significant clinical advantages over other therapeutics, including triptans, for many patients. However, approved DHE products have drawbacks that have resulted in limited clinical use. For instance, injectable DHE, while effective, has invasive administration requirements, and in the case of intravenous (IV) delivery, generally must be administered by a healthcare provider, typically in the hospital or clinic setting, requires specialized equipment and may often result in side effects, in particular, nausea and vomiting. Similarly, intramuscular (IM) and or subcutaneous (SC) injections are invasive, require administration via injection by the patient, caregiver or healthcare provider and patients typically prefer non-injectable therapies. DHE liquid nasal sprays have complex, time-consuming and burdensome administration, as well as high variability and slow absorption that may result in inconsistent and sub-optimal clinical performance. Additionally, DHE plasma levels achievable with DHE liquid nasal sprays may not be sufficient for robust efficacy for many patients. Further, due to DHE’s low oral bioavailability, there are no approved oral DHE products in the United States.
 
We designed STS101 to be a reliable and convenient DHE product capable of delivering the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming the shortcomings of existing DHE products. We believe the key attributes of STS101 may provide significant advantages over existing acute treatments for migraine and result in robust and

consistent clinical performance, thereby facilitating broad adoption and use. These attributes are primarily the result of our proprietary dry-powder formulation, which incorporates a mucoadhesive drug carrier and engineered drug particle technologies, and our proprietary nasal delivery device. These key STS101 attributes include:
 •Rapidly achieving and sustaining target plasma concentrations. In our Phase 1 clinical trials, STS101 rapidly achieved and sustained target DHE plasma concentrations and demonstrated an overall pharmacokinetic (PK) profile that we believe will result in robust and sustained anti-migraine activity.
 •Low PK variability. In our Phase 1 clinical trials, STS101 demonstrated significantly lower variability in peak DHE plasma concentration and DHE exposure as compared to Migranal® (DHE liquid nasal spray), which we believe may lead to more reliable clinical performance.
 •Quick and convenient self-administration. STS101 utilizes a convenient, patient-friendly, single-use, nasal delivery device designed to enable self-administration of a full dose of DHE into a single nostril in a matter of seconds. The pre-filled device is pocket-sized and more compact than available DHE liquid nasal spray products, enabling portability and discreet use, and requires no assembly or priming. Our primary market research with migraine patients and physicians indicates they view these features as important and desirable. In addition, our STS101 dry-powder formulation has demonstrated favorable stability properties (including, insensitivity to light, heat or oxygen) that we expect will enable storage across a wide range of temperatures and conditions.
 •Well tolerated. To date, in our Phase 1 PK trials in healthy volunteers and Phase 3 clinical trials in which more than 1,600 subjects have self-administered STS101 and treated more than 10,000 migraine attacks with STS101 5.2 mg, STS101 has been generally well-tolerated, with low adverse event rates reported. Importantly, STS101 does not exhibit the rapid and high peak concentrations associated with delivery of DHE by IV injection, which may often result in side effects, in particular, nausea and vomiting.
 We believe the foregoing attributes of STS101 could lead to it having a favorable clinical profile as compared to IV, IM or SC delivery of DHE and DHE liquid nasal spray products.
The STS101 administration procedure is shown in the figure below:
 


The faster a DHE product can produce the threshold DHE plasma concentration necessary for a therapeutic response, the more quickly following administration it may be able to exert anti-migraine effects and therapeutic response. At the same time, we believe that rapid and high peak DHE plasma concentrations that greatly exceed the levels required for threshold a therapeutic response level may result in adverse side effects. For example, IV delivery of DHE has demonstrated peak DHE plasma concentrations of 50 ng/ml or more within several minutes of administration, and is reported to more frequently result in side effects (including nausea and vomiting, increases in blood pressure, flushing, dizziness, extremity pain, and abnormal skin sensations) than delivery of DHE by other routes of administration, such as IM or SC injection, nasal or pulmonary, which exhibit much lower peak DHE plasma concentrations that generally have not been reported to exceed approximately 3 to 4 ng/ml. Based on data from our STS101 clinical trials and from published DHE PK and clinical efficacy trials, we estimate that achieving DHE plasma concentrations between 1.0 ng/ml and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 ng/ml within approximately 15 to 30 minutes after dosing may result in clinically significant therapeutic response rates by two hours or earlier after

dosing and low side effect rates as compared with IV DHE delivery. As demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trials, administration of STS101 5.2 mg resulted in DHE plasma concentrations rising rapidly, with mean peak DHE plasma concentrations reaching 2.2 ng/ml at 30 minutes after dosing.
 Our Revised Business Plan and Strategy
 In November 2022 we announced that we do not plan to invest in commercializing STS101 and that we would actively explore alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, while minimizing cash expenditures. Based on the following factors, we revised our business plan and strategy in order to maximize value for our stockholders:
 •results of the Phase 3 SUMMIT trial, in which STS101 did not achieve statistical superiority to placebo on the co-primary outcome measures;
 •our belief, based on review of the SUMMIT trial results in their entirety and our primary market research conducted subsequent to announcement of the SUMMIT trial results, that STS101, if approved and successfully commercialized, has the potential to be an important and differentiated option for the acute treatment of migraine that can address the unmet needs of many people living with migraines;
 •the significant decrease in our stock price that occurred following our announcement of the SUMMIT trial results;
 •current and anticipated future capital market conditions; and
 •our projected need for substantial additional capital were we to continue to develop STS101 through potential regulatory approval and pursue independent commercialization of STS101.
 Accordingly, key elements of our revised business plan and strategy are as follows:
•seek to conclude a strategic transaction with an industrial partner or financial sponsor on favorable terms under which a counterparty will financially support and assume responsibility for completing development of and commercializing STS101 (Potential Strategic Transaction);
 •minimize cash expenditures and continue to invest in and advance the STS101 development program only to the extent necessary to maintain its viability until such time as we may be able to conclude a Potential Strategic Transaction. To this end, in March 2023, we filed an NDA with the FDA for STS101, and if the FDA accepts the NDA for substantive review, we anticipate the FDA action date for the STS101 NDA will be in January 2024; and
 •seek no further funding, as such funding, if available at all, would likely not be available on terms that would be acceptable or favorable to us.
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our revised business plan and strategy, and in the event we are unable to timely conclude a Potential Strategic Transaction on acceptable terms, we may be forced to discontinue development of STS101, withdraw the STS101 NDA and pursue other strategic alternatives, such as dissolution and wind-down.
 
Migraine Overview
 Migraine is a chronic and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by attacks of often severe headache and accompanying neurological symptoms lasting four to 72 hours. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Failure to effectively treat migraine attacks can lead to disease progression, increased frequency of attacks and greater migraine-related disability. Migraine is often accompanied by one or more of the following disabling symptoms:
 •extreme sensitivity to light, sound, touch or smell;
 •nausea and/or vomiting;


•dizziness;
 •visual disturbances;
 •tingling or numbness in the extremities or face; and
 •neck pain.
 Based on reported prevalence data, approximately 39 million individuals in the United States and over 100 million individuals in Europe suffer from migraine. With a global prevalence of greater than one billion, migraine ranks as the world’s third most prevalent illness, the sixth highest specific cause of disability worldwide, and the leading cause of disability in people under 50 years of age. In addition, migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide in terms of number of years lost to disability. It has been estimated that migraine results in up to $36 billion in healthcare and lost productivity costs and up to 157 million lost workdays annually in the United States. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated illness due to lack of awareness, stigma and the inherent limitations of currently available therapies.
 The underlying causes of migraine are not well understood; however, both genetics and environmental factors appear to be relevant. Further, the underlying biology of migraine is complex and multifactorial, and it is believed that migraine susceptibility arises from genetic predisposition to generalized neuronal hyperexcitability. During a migraine attack, hyperexcitable neurons cause the release of various vasoactive, pro-inflammatory and neuroactive substances, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, histamine, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and serotonin, leading to vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and neurological symptoms, including headache and pain.
 Migraine treatment can generally be categorized as either acute or preventive. Treatment guidelines indicate that all patients should be offered acute treatment, which is focused on stopping the migraine attack quickly and restoring the patient’s ability to function with minimal side effects. In addition to receiving acute treatments, a subset of patients (typically those with more severe and/or frequent migraine attacks) may also receive preventive treatment, which is focused on reducing the frequency, duration or severity of migraine attacks or the associated disability caused by such attacks. Historically, preventive therapies, such as anti-convulsants, beta blockers and onabotulinumtoxinA injections, have lacked strong efficacy for many patients, have been associated with significant side effects or required burdensome administration. The recent development and introduction of anti-CGRP therapeutics as a new class of preventive therapy is raising awareness of the treatment opportunities in migraine and may lead to an increase in the number patients being diagnosed and treated for migraine. However, these new therapies do not alleviate the need for acute therapies, as such products that have been approved to date on average result in patients experiencing a reduction of only two migraine days per month. Despite its high prevalence and burden, migraine remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated illness due to lack of awareness, stigma and the inherent limitations of currently available therapies.
 Current Acute Treatment Paradigm
 Patients typically seek acute treatment for migraine to relieve pain and associated symptoms. The current treatment guidelines from the American Headache Society define the five goals of acute therapy as:
 •Rapid and consistent freedom from pain and associated symptoms without recurrence;
 •Restored ability to function;
 •Minimal need for repeat dosing or rescue medications;
 •Optimal self-care and reduced subsequent use of resources (e.g., emergency room visits, diagnostic imaging, healthcare provider and ambulatory infusion center visits); and
 •Minimal or no side effects.
 Acute treatments are typically administered orally, via injection or nasally. Orally-administered acute treatments have significant limitations, including relatively slow onset of effect due to the time required for absorption of the drug from the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion. During a migraine attack, absorption of

orally-administered treatments can be delayed due to gastric stasis, which commonly occurs in people with migraine both during and between attacks. In addition, orally-administered acute treatments are inappropriate for the many migraine patients who experience significant nausea or vomiting with their attacks or who have trouble swallowing orally-administered medications. Injectable therapies, while often offering the fastest means of achieving therapeutic plasma levels of the administered drug product, often require the involvement of a healthcare provider, can be difficult to self-administer and typically result in greater side effects than non-injectable therapies. As a result, patients generally prefer non-injectable therapies over injectable therapies. While nasal administration of acute treatments has the potential to address certain of these limitations by facilitating rapid absorption of drug from the linings of the nasal passages into the bloodstream while simultaneously limiting side effects, currently available and development-stage nasally-administered acute treatments have drawbacks and limitations. These drawbacks and limitations may include one or more of the following:
 •Efficacy that is comparable or only incrementally better than orally-administered acute treatments;
 •Partial or variable absorption in the nose, with the remaining fraction of drug delivered into the nasal passage running down the back of the throat and being swallowed with potential for any subsequent absorption in the gastrointestinal tract to be poor or delayed;
 •Variable pharmacokinetics (PK), resulting in inconsistent and sub-optimal clinical performance and perceived lack of reliability;
 •For liquid nasal spray formulations, the administered drug product often drips out of the nose and runs-off down the back of throat, which can result in unpleasant taste;
 •Non-intuitive and cumbersome administration procedures, including the need for assembly, priming and multiple administrations (sprays or insufflations) over time in order to deliver a full dose. For example, this is the case with Migranal DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray, for which the self-administration procedure requires four sprays, one in each nostril initially, followed by an additional spray in each nostril 15 minutes later, to administer a full dose; and
 •Large size, which reduces practicality of transport for patients and ability to discreetly self-administer.
 Acute treatments are categorized as non-specific therapies, including NSAIDs and acetaminophen, and migraine-specific therapies, such as triptans, ergot alkaloids (including DHE-based products), gepants and a ditan. Non-specific therapies are generally recommended for the acute treatment of migraine with mild to moderate pain, and migraine-specific therapies are generally recommended for the acute treatment of migraine with moderate to severe pain. However, none of the currently available treatment options adequately achieve the acute treatment goals for a significant percentage of migraine patients.
 Triptans
 Oral triptans are currently the predominant class of drug for acute treatment of migraine, accounting for approximately 78% of migraine-specific acute therapy prescriptions, or over 19 million prescriptions in the United States in 2022. Triptans are serotonergic agonists, typically with selective activity on a limited number of serotonergic receptors, including the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. While widely prescribed, triptans have been reported to have low treatment persistence, with up to 66% of patients never refilling their initial triptan prescriptions. A substantial majority of patients who discontinue triptans cite a lack of efficacy and side effects as the reasons for discontinuation. Triptans have been reported to have a number of shortcomings, including being inconsistent and having sub-optimal efficacy, leading to side effects and medication overuse headaches, having early treatment requirements that only allow for a short therapeutic window, and having a slow and variable onset of action and short duration of effect.
 Oral and Nasal CGRP Receptor Agonists (gepants)
 First commercially introduced in the United States in early 2020, the gepants are a class of migraine-specific acute treatments, available in oral and liquid nasal spray dosage forms, that act as antagonists of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Two orally-administered gepant products, ubrogepant and rimegepant, are currently approved in the United States for the acute treatment of migraine and together accounted for more than one billion

dollars in 2022 net sales in the United States. In early 2023, a third gepant product, zavegepant, a liquid nasal spray dosage form, was approved in the United States. The two oral gepant products accounted for up to 18% of migraine-specific acute therapy prescriptions in the United States in 2022. We believe these trends reflect the large size of the migraine patient population, the significant unmet need among people with migraine for new and improved acute treatments and the large potential commercial opportunity for such products. The systemic safety and tolerability of the gepants is reported to be favorable, and because gepants are thought to act by mechanisms other than vasoconstriction, recommended use is not restricted to patients who do not have cardiovascular risk factors or disease, as is the case for triptan and ergot alkaloid products (including DHE) due to their vasoconstrictive actions. However, zavegepant, a liquid nasal spray gepant product approved by FDA in early 2023, is reported to have relatively high rates of taste issues as a side effect. The efficacy of the gepants is reported to be modest in comparison with the triptans and potentially not meaningfully greater than that of simple analgesics than can be purchased without a prescription.
 DHE
 DHE products have long been recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for the acute treatment of migraine. DHE has broader pharmacological activity than triptans across multiple receptor types, including serotonergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors, represses CGRP release, and is thought to inhibit neuroinflammation and central sensitization via adrenergic receptors. In addition, DHE has a long pharmacodynamic half-life thought to be attributed to slow receptor dissociation. Because of its differentiated clinical attributes, many headache specialists consider DHE to be a preferred treatment for many difficult-to-treat migraine types, including severe migraine, migraine with allodynia, migraine upon awakening, fast onset migraine, prolonged and recurrent migraine attacks, including menstrual-related migraine, and migraine attacks requiring late treatment (i.e., more than one hour after onset of attack). In addition, DHE is considered a standard-of-care treatment for medication-overuse headache, or MOH, and for status migrainosus, which is a condition characterized by debilitating migraine attacks that last more than 72 hours. Given the complexity of migraine biology and the redundancy and interdependence of migraine disease pathways, DHE’s activity across multiple receptors is thought to offer the potential for better responses for many migraine patients.
 DHE has a number of differentiating clinical attributes providing advantages for the acute treatment of migraine, including:
 •Effective in patients who are non-responsive or refractory to triptan therapy. Published data indicate that approximately half of all patients who have previously failed to adequately respond to triptan therapy, do respond to DHE therapy.
 •Effective in migraine attacks with allodynia. Allodynia is present in up to two-thirds of migraine attacks, and its presence is associated with poor response to triptans and most other acute treatments. DHE, however, has demonstrated strong efficacy in migraine attacks in which allodynia is present.
 •Effective irrespective of when administered during the time course of a migraine attack. Unlike triptans and certain other acute treatments for migraine, which are most effective when administered within one hour of onset of pain, DHE remains effective when administered late after onset of attack.
 •Low risk of headache recurrence. DHE has been demonstrated in head-to-head controlled studies to have significantly lower headache recurrence rates than available triptan therapies.
 •Lower risk of causing MOH. DHE is thought to have a lower potential for causing MOH with frequent use and, unlike triptan class therapies, currently approved DHE products do not contain a label warning for MOH potential.
 Due to its chemical properties and structure, DHE has low bioavailability (approximately 1%) when administered orally and, as a result, oral forms have generally not been effective for the acute treatment of migraine. There are currently no approved oral DHE treatments in the United States. Approved DHE products include injectable and liquid nasal spray dosage forms, which have drawbacks that have resulted in limited clinical use.
 Due to DHE’s vasoconstrictive effects, DHE products are not recommended for use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, approved DHE products carry a “black box” warning in their labels for a risk

that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs, including specific antivirals and antibiotics, may result in elevated levels of DHE, potentially causing vasospasm that may result in inadequate blood flow to the extremities or the brain. Unless we can successfully demonstrate by conducting drug-drug interaction studies and potentially additional studies that the coadministration of DHE and certain other drugs does not result in drug-drug interactions, the FDA is likely to require the label for STS101, if approved, to include such warning, and this could result in STS101 not achieving its full commercial potential.
 Injectable DHE
 IV delivery is the fastest means of achieving plasma concentration levels of DHE that we estimate to be necessary to effectively treat a migraine attack, with anti-migraine responses reported as quickly as 15-20 minutes following administration. IV-delivered DHE is typically administered by a healthcare provider in a hospital, clinic or infusion center setting, which is expensive and requires the patient to travel to one of these locations while suffering from a migraine attack. Because IV delivery of DHE results in rapid achievement of high DHE plasma levels, side effects are more common with IV administration than with other routes of administration, with nausea and vomiting being particularly common and typically requiring coadministration of anti-nausea medication. DHE can also be administered by IM or SC injection. However, IM and SC administration require a patient, caregiver or healthcare provider to use proper technique during a migraine attack to draw the correct dose of DHE solution for injection from a vial or glass ampule into a syringe and then inject the solution into the muscle or subcutaneous layer of the skin. Although generally considered effective, the challenges of injectable DHE and the fact that migraine patients typically prefer non-injectable therapies for acute treatment of attacks make injectable DHE a less favored treatment option for many people with migraine.
 DHE Liquid Nasal Sprays
 DHE may also be delivered via liquid nasal spray. However, DHE liquid nasal spray products have a number of limitations and complexities related to their liquid formulation and delivery devices, which may include:
 -high pharmacokinetic variability and slow absorption;
 -inability to achieve DHE plasma levels sufficient for robust efficacy;
 -complex administration procedures, including requirements for vial-opening, assembly, priming and administration of multiple sprays into both nostrils, that are burdensome and time-consuming for patients to perform;
 -relatively large physical size;
 -stringent storage requirements and potential for limited shelf life due to the liquid DHE formulation being sensitive to light, heat and oxygen;
 -packaging that results in some patients experiencing injury while preparing to self-administer; and
 -utilization of hydrofluoroalkane propellants that are potent greenhouse gases.
 Headache specialists articulate a need for a patient-friendly, self-administered, non-injected DHE product that consistently and reliably provides the rapid, durable and robust efficacy that is currently available only with injectable DHE therapies. Given the differentiated clinical features of DHE, we believe DHE, if made available in a non-injectable dosage form that is well tolerated, facilitates quick and convenient administration and delivers rapid and sustained achievement of therapeutic concentrations with low variability, could provide significant benefits over existing acute treatments for migraine and help a large number of people living with migraine achieve better treatment outcomes.
 Our Solution: STS101 for the Acute Treatment of Migraine
 STS101 is an investigational drug-device combination of a proprietary dry-powder formulation of DHE administered by a proprietary pre-filled, single-use, nasal delivery device. STS101 is specifically designed to deliver the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming the shortcomings that have limited the utility of DHE for the acute treatment of migraine. The proprietary and foundational dry-powder formulation and nasal delivery device

technologies incorporated in STS101 were developed over more than 15 years by a dedicated team at Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd., or SNBL.
 Subsequent to licensing such technology from SNBL, we advanced the development of STS101 by developing and optimizing the STS101 formulation, establishing analytical methods and scalable and commercial-scale manufacturing performed in accordance with good manufacturing practices, conducting extensive analytical characterization of STS101 and its components, and completing toxicology studies in accordance with good laboratory practices. The manufacturing processes we established employ standard technologies that are commonly utilized in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture of approved drug and drug-device combination products, and we are establishing commercial-scale manufacturing capability for STS101 via relationships with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.
 


We designed STS101 to be a reliable easy-to-use and convenient DHE product capable of delivering the clinical advantages of DHE while overcoming the shortcomings of existing DHE products. We believe the key attributes of STS101 may provide significant advantages over existing acute treatments for migraine and result in robust and consistent clinical performance, thereby facilitating broad adoption and use. These attributes are primarily the result of our proprietary dry-powder formulation, which incorporates a mucoadhesive drug carrier and engineered drug particle technologies, and our proprietary nasal delivery device. These key STS101 attributes include:
 •Rapidly achieving and sustaining target plasma concentrations. In our Phase 1 clinical trials, STS101 rapidly achieved and sustained target DHE plasma concentrations and demonstrated an overall pharmacokinetic (PK) profile that we believe results in robust and sustained anti-migraine activity. 
 •Low PK variability. In our Phase 1 clinical trials, STS101 demonstrated significantly lower variability in peak DHE plasma concentration and DHE exposure as compared to Migranal, which we believe, may lead to more reliable clinical performance.
 •Quick and convenient self-administration. STS101 utilizes a convenient, patient-friendly, single-use, nasal delivery device designed to enable self-administration of a full dose of DHE into a single nostril in a matter of seconds. The pre-filled device is pocket-sized and more compact than available DHE liquid nasal spray products, enabling portability and discreet use, and requires no assembly or priming. Our primary market research with migraine patients and physicians indicates they view these features as important and desirable. In addition, the STS101 dry-powder formulation has demonstrated favorable stability properties (including, insensitivity to light, heat or oxygen) that we expect will enable storage across a wide range of temperatures and conditions.
 •Well tolerated. To date, in our Phase 1 PK trials in healthy volunteers and Phase 3 clinical trials in which more than 1,600 subjects with migraine have treated more than 10,000 migraine attacks with STS101 5.2 mg, STS101 has been generally well-tolerated, with low adverse event rates reported. Importantly, STS101 does not exhibit the rapid and high peak concentrations associated with IV delivery of DHE, which may often result in side effects, in particular, nausea and vomiting.
 We believe the foregoing attributes of STS101 offer the potential for a favorable clinical profile as compared to IV, IM or SC delivery of DHE and DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray products.


The faster a DHE product can produce the threshold DHE plasma concentration necessary for a therapeutic response, the more quickly following administration it may be able to exert anti-migraine effects and therapeutic response. At the same time, we believe that rapid and high peak DHE plasma concentrations that greatly exceed the levels required for threshold a therapeutic response level may result in adverse side effects. For example, IV delivery of DHE has demonstrated peak DHE plasma concentrations of 50 ng/ml or more within several minutes of administration, and is reported to more frequently result in side effects (including nausea and vomiting, increases in blood pressure, flushing, dizziness, extremity pain, and abnormal skin sensations) than delivery of DHE by other routes of administration, such as IM or SC injection, nasal or pulmonary, which exhibit much lower peak DHE plasma concentrations that generally have not been reported to exceed approximately 3 to 4 ng/ml. Based on data from our STS101 clinical trials and from published DHE PK and clinical efficacy trials, we estimate that achieving DHE plasma concentrations between 1.0 ng/ml and approximately 2.5 to 3.5 ng/ml within approximately 15 to 30 minutes after dosing may result in clinically significant therapeutic response rates by two hours or earlier after dosing and low side effect rates as compared with IV DHE delivery. As demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trials, administration of STS101 5.2 mg resulted in DHE plasma concentrations rising rapidly, with mean peak DHE plasma concentrations reaching 2.2 ng/ml at 30 minutes after dosing.
The STS101 administration procedure is shown in the figure below:
 



Development Plan and Regulatory Pathway
 Our development plan for STS101 was informed by published FDA guidance as well as our discussions with the FDA. In March 2023, we filed an NDA for STS101 with the FDA, and if the FDA accepts the NDA for substantive review, we anticipate the FDA action date for the STS101 NDA will be in January 2024. Based on written feedback provided to us by the FDA, we believe the results of our completed Phase 1 pharmacokinetic clinical trials and our ASCEND Phase 3 long-term safety trial are sufficient, in combination with information referenced from studies not conducted by us, to support FDA approval of STS101.
 As has been our longstanding plan, we are seeking FDA approval of STS101 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway that allows us to reference some of the information required for STS101 approval from studies not conducted by us. Our 505(b)(2) NDA for STS101 references the NDAs for D.H.E. 45 (DHE mesylate injectable solution) and Migranal (DHE mesylate liquid nasal spray). Neither of these DHE reference products is covered under any unexpired patents nor is the subject of any Hatch-Waxman exclusivity that could delay approval of our NDA. We believe our development strategy provides an expeditious and cost-efficient approval pathway for STS101 in the United States.
 The FDA has communicated to us in multiple meetings that a pivotal efficacy trial, such as the STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which we completed and announced results from in November 2022, is not required for approval of STS101, as the efficacy of STS101 may be established via a “pharmacokinetic bridge” to the 505(b)(2) DHE reference products, D.H.E. 45 (DHE injectable solution) and Migranal (DHE liquid nasal spray). The FDA has also communicated to us that the results of the SUMMIT trial may be considered for inclusion in the STS101 prescribing information if the study is adequate and well-controlled and has results supportive of efficacy. We believe that the SUMMIT trial was adequate and well-controlled and that the results from the trial provide a totality of evidence that is supportive of the efficacy of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine despite STS101 not having demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo on the co-primary endpoints at the two-hour post-administration timepoint. We further believe that STS101 can address unmet needs of many people with migraine,

and that the results of the SUMMIT trial, if included in the prescribing information for STS101, if approved by FDA, would provide important treatment information to physicians and patients.
 STS101 Clinical Trials
 Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Trials
 We have reported results from two Phase 1 PK clinical trials of STS101 in healthy volunteers, the first conducted in 2018 and the second in 2021. In both trials, STS101 demonstrated rapid and sustained DHE plasma concentrations, low pharmacokinetic variability, and a generally favorable safety and tolerability profile. We believe the overall pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated by STS101 5.2 mg in these trials results in robust anti-migraine activity and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 The Phase 1 PK trial completed in June 2021 compared the DHE blood plasma levels (or PK profiles) of STS101 with the PK profiles of the DHE reference products D.H.E. 45 (DHE injectable solution) administered via intramuscular injection and Migranal (DHE liquid nasal spray). Based on our analyses of the results of this study and our communications with FDA, we believe this Phase 1 PK study establishes the pharmacokinetic bridge to the DHE reference products that is required by FDA to support the filing and potential approval of the STS101 NDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
 ASCEND: Phase 3 Safety Trial
 In January 2023, we completed our ASCEND trial, in which we enrolled more than 480 subjects with migraine who treated their migraine attacks with STS101 on an as-needed basis for up to approximately 18 months. The key objective of the ASCEND trial was to demonstrate the local nasal safety of STS101, administered repeatedly over time, in the acute treatment of migraine, so as to fulfill the safety exposure requirements previously communicated to us by the FDA, i.e., at least 150 subjects completing six months of treatment with STS101 and potentially at least 50 subjects completing 12 months of treatment, using investigational product incorporating our second-generation STS101 delivery device. Our STS101 NDA includes interim safety results from the STS101 ASCEND trial for more than 150 subjects who completed at least six months of treatment with STS101 incorporating the second-generation nasal delivery device. Based on our communications with FDA, we do not believe additional long-term safety exposure data is necessary to support an NDA filing and potential approval. However, provided we don't sooner decide to terminate the STS101 development program and pursue other strategic alternatives such as dissolution and wind-down, we plan to submit additional final safety data from the ASCEND trial to the NDA as part of the 120-Day Safety Update that we are required by statute to be submit to the FDA within four months of the initial NDA submission. The ASCEND trial results we plan to submit to the NDA as part of the 120-Day Safety Update includes safety data for more than fifty subjects who have completed at least twelve months of treatment with STS101 incorporating the second-generation nasal delivery device.
SUMMIT: Phase 3 Efficacy Trial
 Our Phase 3 SUMMIT efficacy trial was a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of single doses of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine in approximately 1,600 subjects. After establishing eligibility, study participants were randomized (1:1) to receive one of two treatments: STS101 DHE 5.2 mg or matching placebo, both of which incorporated our improved, second-generated nasal delivery device. After randomization, the trial participants were instructed to treat their next migraine attack of moderate or severe pain severity with the allocated blinded study medication. All study participants were trained multiple times in the STS101 administration procedure prior to use, and we provided each participant with an electronic device preloaded with diary software designed to capture relevant trial data.
 In November 2022, we announced topline results from our STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 efficacy trial showing numerical differences in favor of STS101 versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at the two-hour post-administration timepoint (MBS-free). However, these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p-value <0.05).


STS101 did, however, demonstrate statistically significant effects on both freedom-from-pain and MBS-free endpoints by three hours post-dose and at all subsequent timepoints at which efficacy was assessed (4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours). In addition, STS101 was statistically superior to placebo on multiple key secondary endpoints considered clinically relevant and recommended for assessment in acute-treatment-of-migraine efficacy trials by the FDA in its current industry guidance document and/or the International Headache Society’s guidelines for controlled trials:
 •Proportion of subjects with pain relief at 2 hours post-dose (p=0.0017) and at all timepoints thereafter
 •Proportion of subjects requiring rescue medication within 24 hours and 48 hours post-treatment (p<0.0001 and p=0.0001, respectively)
 •Proportion of subjects with 24-hour sustained freedom from pain, i.e., the proportion of subjects who reported no headache pain at 2 hours post-dose who remained free from pain at all timepoints through 24 hours (p=0.0479)
 Consistent with previous clinical trial experience, STS101 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in SUMMIT. The only treatment-emergent adverse event reported by more than 5% of SUMMIT subjects who self-administered STS101 was nasal discomfort, reported by 8.3% of subjects. No treatment-related serious adverse events or cardiovascular events occurred.
 The FDA has communicated to us in multiple meetings that a pivotal efficacy trial, such as the STS101 SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which we completed and announced results from in November 2022, is not required for approval of STS101, as the efficacy of STS101 may be established via a “pharmacokinetic bridge” to the 505(b)(2) DHE reference products, D.H.E. 45 (DHE injectable solution) and Migranal (DHE liquid nasal spray). The FDA has also communicated to us that the results of the SUMMIT trial may be considered for inclusion in the STS101 prescribing information if the study is adequate and well-controlled and has results supportive of efficacy. We believe that the SUMMIT trial was adequate and well-controlled and that the results from the trial provide a totality of evidence that is supportive of the efficacy of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine despite STS101 not having demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo on the co-primary endpoints at the two-hour post-administration timepoint. We further believe that STS101 can address unmet needs of many people with migraine, and that the results of the SUMMIT trial, if included in the prescribing information for STS101, if approved by FDA, would provide important treatment information to physicians and patients.
 EMERGE: Phase 3 Efficacy Trial
 Our Phase 3 EMERGE efficacy trial was a multi-center, single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of single doses of STS101 in the acute treatment of migraine in approximately 1,140 subjects. After establishing eligibility, study participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of three treatments: STS101 DHE 3.9 mg, STS101 DHE 5.2 mg or matching placebo, all of which incorporated an earlier first-generation version of our nasal delivery device that we subsequently determined was prone to under-delivering medication under certain conditions. After randomization, the trial participants were instructed to treat their next migraine attack of moderate or severe pain severity with the allocated blinded study medication. All study participants were trained multiple times in the STS101 administration procedure prior to use, and we provided each participant with an electronic device preloaded with diary software designed to capture relevant trial data.
 We completed enrollment in our EMERGE Phase 3 trial in May 2020, randomizing 1,201 subjects with migraine to one of two STS101 dosage strengths or placebo. In September 2020, we announced topline data from the EMERGE trial. Although STS101 3.9 mg and 5.2 mg showed favorable numerical differences versus placebo on the pre-specified co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (from among photophobia, phonophobia and nausea) at two hours post-administration, these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p-value <0.05) for either dosage strength. The table below summarizes the results of STS101 on the co-primary endpoints in the EMERGE trial.
 Both dose strengths of STS101 did, however, demonstrate statistically significant effects (nominal p-value < 0.05) on both freedom from pain and most bothersome symptom endpoints by three hours post-dose and all

subsequent time points. In addition, STS101 demonstrated statistically significant effects on multiple, pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints.
 Both STS101 dose strengths were generally well-tolerated in the EMERGE trial, with low adverse event rates and no drug-related serious adverse events reported. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nasal discomfort, dysgeusia, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nausea. The most frequent nasal adverse event (discomfort) occurred in less than 6% of all trial participants who administered STS101.
 Additional Trials
 We and our licensor, Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd. (SNBL), have completed human factors studies, including a human factors validation study, that we believe support self-administration of STS101 in the outpatient setting for the treatment of migraine and validate the STS101 instructions for use.
 We do not plan to undertake additional clinical trials with STS101. We do not plan to conduct further Phase 1 trials or any other additional studies that could be required by the FDA to demonstrate that the coadministration of STS101 and certain other drugs does not result in drug-drug interactions, and without positive results from such further Phase 1 trials or potential other additional studies, the FDA may require a “black box” warning in the label for STS101, if approved, in line with the warnings that are included in the labels for other approved DHE products.
 Because migraine affects adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) and children (six to eleven years of age), pediatric studies are required under the Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. To address such requirements, we designed an initial pediatric study plan, or iPSP, consistent with the FDA guidance Migraine: Developing Drugs for Acute Treatment (February 2018) with which the FDA has agreed. Under the pediatric exclusivity provision of the FDCA, if FDA issues a written request for the pediatric studies and they are conducted pursuant to the written request, STS101 could qualify for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity. Moreover, if the conducted iPSP leads to an approval of STS101 for pediatric migraine patients, then this population could use STS101.
 Manufacturing
 Our manufacturing and regulatory teams have substantial experience in manufacturing process development, registration and the commercial manufacture of drug-device combination products, including inhalation-route drug-device combination products. We do not have internal manufacturing facilities and all of our manufacturing processes, which must comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, are outsourced to third party CMOs, with oversight by our internal managers. We own or have contracted to purchase certain equipment, including plastic component molds, semi-custom automated filling and assembly equipment, and semi-custom packaging equipment, for our third-party CMOs to utilize in the manufacture of STS101 or its components. We rely on third-party CMOs to produce sufficient quantities of drug product for use in clinical trials. We intend to continue this practice for any future clinical trials and production of STS101, if approved, for commercial sale.
 We selected processes for manufacturing of STS101 that we believe are readily scalable and transferable, and all of our STS101 manufacturing processes employ standard technologies that are commonly utilized in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture of approved drug and drug-device combination products. However, certain processes for the manufacture of STS101 involve trade secrets and/or require custom or semi-custom equipment that is not available for off-the-shelf purchase, requires substantial investment, and/or has long lead times associated with its design, manufacture, delivery, installation and qualification.


The drug substance of STS101 is supplied by a drug substance manufacturer, which has extensive experience manufacturing the STS101 drug substance under cGMP, has an active Drug Master File, or DMF, registered with FDA, and has the capacity to meet our anticipated clinical and commercial supply needs. We believe there are additional drug substance manufacturers with active DMFs registered with the FDA that could potentially serve as back-up suppliers for us.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates. If approved for the acute treatment of migraine, we anticipate that STS101 would compete against other marketed migraine therapies for the acute treatment of migraine and may compete with products currently under development by other companies.
 In 2022, approximately 19.3 million prescriptions for migraine-specific acute therapies were written in the United States. This figure excludes prescriptions of non-specific therapies, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, and thus likely understates the total number of prescriptions written for the acute treatment of migraine. The majority of the prescriptions written were for generic triptans. There are seven FDA-approved triptan molecules available in branded and branded generic/generic oral dosage forms, and two of these molecules are also available in injectable and/or liquid nasal spray dosage forms that may have faster onset of action than oral dosage forms. With respect to DHE products, we will compete with Bausch Health’s Migranal DHE liquid nasal spray and its authorized and third-party generic equivalents as well as the branded injectable DHE product and its generic equivalents. In addition, in September 2021 Impel NeuroPharma announced FDA approval of a DHE liquid nasal spray product that utilizes the same liquid formulation and container closure system as Migranal, but with a different propellant-powered, single-use delivery device that requires a multi-step vial-opening, assembly and priming procedure. Impel NeuroPharma received FDA approval for its DHE liquid nasal spray product on the basis of a clinical development program that included only a comparative pharmacokinetic study and an open-label, uncontrolled, repeat-dose safety trial (and not a randomized, controlled, double-blinded Phase 3 efficacy study which the FDA typically requires to support any product-specific marketing claims relating to efficacy). Impel NeuroPharma commenced commercialization of its DHE liquid nasal spray product in the U.S. in late 2021. We believe the Impel product has many of the same limitations as Migranal, does not significantly improve DHE absorption or pharmacokinetics as compared with Migranal to an extent that we believe likely to be clinically relevant, and has not been evaluated for efficacy in any randomized, controlled, double-blinded efficacy trial.
 We also face competition from newer oral and nasal-route migraine-specific acute treatments that have been recently approved by FDA and commercially introduced in 2020 such as Eli Lilly’s lasmiditan, a ditan, two oral gepants, Abbvie’s ubrogepant and Pfizer’s rimegepant, and a liquid nasal spray gepant, Pfizer’s zavegepant, that was approved by FDA in early 2023. Because rimegepant, ubrogepant, zavegepant and lasmiditan are thought to act by mechanisms other than vasoconstriction, recommended use is not restricted to patients who do not have cardiovascular risk factors or disease, as is the case for triptan and ergot alkaloid products (including DHE) due to their vasoconstrictive actions. Although the labels for rimegepant, ubrogepant, zavegepant and lasmiditan do not limit use to patients without cardiovascular risk factors or disease, we believe these products have disadvantages. For example, lasmiditan has been reported to commonly cause central nervous system adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia, and the lasmiditan label includes warnings for driving impairment and operation of machinery for at least eight hours after taking a lasmiditan dose, central nervous system depression, serotonin syndrome, and medication overuse headache. Additionally, because lasmiditan has shown potential for abuse and dependence, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, has designated lasmiditan as a controlled substance; this designation imposes licensing and documentation requirements upon prescribers and as well restricts distribution. With ubrogepant, Rimegepant and zavegepant, reported efficacy is modest in comparison with efficacy historically reported with triptan and DHE products. Moreover, prescribing of ubrogepant, and to a lesser extent rimegepant, may be complicated by the potential for interactions with a variety of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements, with this potential necessitating dose adjustment of or contraindication to ubrogepant. Zavegepant is reported have a relatively high rate of dysgeusia, or taste disturbances, as a side effect.


Although we believe STS101 and our development strategy has potential advantages over DHE liquid nasal sprays and other anti-migraine treatments, there can be no assurance that STS101, if approved, will be able to successfully compete against these products.
 Intellectual Property
 The commercial success of STS101 depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for STS101, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 With regard to STS101, we have patents and applications to formulations, dosages, devices, and methods of use. As of December 31, 2022, we own or have exclusive license rights under more than sixty U.S. patents and foreign patents and pending applications. In the U.S., we own or have exclusive license rights under ten issued U.S. patents relating to STS101 with estimated expiration dates ranging from 2023 until the end of 2039 (absent any adjustments or extensions of term). Recently-issued and allowed U.S. patents relating to STS101 that we own or are exclusively licensed under include U.S. Patent 10,758,532, issued September 1, 2020, U.S. Patent 10,792,253, issued October 6, 2022, and U.S. Patent Application 16/137,852. If issued, we project future patents resulting from pending U.S. patent applications relating to STS101 will expire between 2033 and 2040 (absent any adjustments or extensions of term). As of December 31, 2022, all but one issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to STS101 were exclusively licensed from SNBL. The pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to STS101 are solely owned by us or exclusively licensed from SNBL.
 The patent portfolio for STS101 is directed to cover formulations, dosages, devices, and methods of treatment. This patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national and regional counterpart patents and patent applications. As of December 31, 2022, all except one of the issued US patents were exclusively licensed from SNBL. Royalties on products covered by this exclusive license are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latter of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering such product and the ten-year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. For more information on the SNBL License, see the section titled “Business—Licenses and Collaborations.” We own U.S. patent applications relating to the formulations, dosages, devices and methods of use for DHE and related compounds in the treatment and prevention of headache.
 The terms of patents and patent applications, if issued, relating to STS101 in other jurisdictions (including Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, China, India, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Korea, Mexico, Russia), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2025 and 2039. We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 The commercial success of STS101 will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that may be required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.


Licenses and Collaborations
 In June 2016, we and SNBL, entered into a licensing and assignment agreement, or the SNBL License, which was amended and restated in December 2016 and further amended in January 2017, April 2017, October 2017, and May 2020. We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on the SNBL License for purposes of our development and potential commercialization of STS101. From the time we entered into the SNBL License until the consummation of our Series A convertible preferred stock financing in December 2016, we were a subsidiary of SNBL and SNBL continues to hold over 5% of our outstanding capital stock. Under the SNBL License, SNBL assigned to us certain patent rights and know-how that are directed to SNBL’s proprietary nasal drug delivery technology, including its proprietary nasal delivery device, or the Device, and formulation technologies, for use with DHE, or the DHE Product. SNBL granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights and know-how, other than the assigned patent rights and know-how, to develop, make, use, and commercialize DHE Products in the field of treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of all indications and human medical conditions, as well as the products consisting of the Device used to deliver a combination of DHE and one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients other than DHE, or DHE Combination Products, in the field of treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of migraine and non-migraine headaches. We granted to SNBL a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license, under our rights in improvements to the Device, to develop, make, use, and commercialize products and devices other than DHE Products and DHE Combination Products. During the term of the SNBL License, we, SNBL, and our and SNBL’s affiliates are not permitted to develop or commercialize, or to enable third parties to develop or commercialize, a product containing DHE as an active ingredient for delivery through nasal tissues or the respiratory system, other than pursuant to the SNBL License. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of DHE Products and DHE Combination Products under the SNBL License. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one such product, initially in the United States.
 Under the SNBL License, in 2016 we reimbursed SNBL for approximately $80,000 of costs relating to our incorporation and prosecution and maintenance of the product-specific patents. We also agreed to make royalty payments based on a low single-digit percentage of worldwide net sales of DHE Products and DHE Combination Products, payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering such product and the ten-year anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The royalty payments are subject to reductions based on royalties paid to any third party under a license to such third party’s patent rights.
 We have the sole right to control the prosecution and maintenance of, and to enforce, the patent rights that SNBL assigned to us. SNBL has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights that SNBL licensed to us. We have step in rights if SNBL does not continue such prosecution and maintenance. We also have the first right to enforce such licensed patent rights with respect to certain infringing products. If we do not bring an action to enforce such patents against infringing activities that involve such infringing products, SNBL has the right to bring such an action.
 Unless earlier terminated, the SNBL License continues on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of the obligation to pay royalties with respect such product and country. We may terminate the SNBL License in its entirety without cause on ninety days’ prior written notice. SNBL may terminate the SNBL License for our material breach that remains uncured for ninety days. SNBL may also terminate the SNBL License if we challenge the licensed patents, or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. In addition, SNBL has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our insolvency.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.


Our product candidate, STS101, is subject to regulation in the United States as a drug-device combination product. If marketed individually, the drug component and the propriety device component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center within FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over the product’s regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of STS101, the FDA has confirmed that the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product. Accordingly, STS101 will be regulated as a drug product by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, which will have primary jurisdiction over premarket development and approval. We are seeking approval of STS101 through an NDA that we submitted to CDER in March 2023 through the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. We do not expect that the FDA will require separate marketing authorization for the proprietary device constituent of STS101. However, the drug delivery device component of STS101 will be subject to consulting review by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and we will be required to comply with applicable provisions of the medical device Quality System Regulation as part of ensuring STS101 complies with cGMP. The FDA has required that we conduct human factors studies to support approval of STS101, which we believe we have successfully completed. To date, we and SNBL have completed a robust human factors program, including a validation study, that we believe supports self-administration of STS101 in the outpatient setting for the treatment of migraine and validates the STS101 instructions for use that we are utilizing.
 U.S. Drug Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use or new formulation of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before a clinical study may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.


Preclinical and Clinical Studies
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and any available human data or literature to support use of the product in humans. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before a study may be initiated at the site, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
 •Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or into subjects with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited population of subjects with the target disease or condition to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
 •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded population of subjects with the target disease or condition, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 •Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development and testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. In March 2023, the FDA informed us that it had granted us a small business waiver of PDUFA filing fees for the STS101 NDA, which we subsequently submitted to the FDA.
 An NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. Priority review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that relevant study data was obtained in compliance with GCP requirements.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A tentative approval may be issued for an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA if the sponsor must await the expiration of applicable patents or other exclusivity covering the previously approved product referenced in the application before obtaining final approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the

regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. For 505(b)(2) NDAs, FDA will typically require a REMS if the reference product is required to have a REMS. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation.
 Further, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the changes can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.


The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 ANDA Approval Process
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, with the FDA.
 An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA suitability petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug or is intended for a different use, and it is not otherwise subject to an approved suitability petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 505(b)(2) NDAs
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of

the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, NDA holders may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA.
 A non-NCE drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval or change to a previously approved product, such as a new formulation or method of administration for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has concluded. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and being the review process during the exclusivity period. A drug approved under Section 505(b)(2) may also be eligible for pediatric exclusivity if the FDA issues a Written Request for one or more pediatric studies, the manufacturer conducts the studies and submits written reports to the FDA, and such studies meet the conditions of the Written Request. If granted, pediatric exclusivity extends any existing marketing exclusivity or patent protection for the product by an additional six months.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market STS101 in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not

ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, false claims, civil monetary penalties laws, consumer protection and transparency laws as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other non-physician healthcare professionals including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations

govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among U.S. third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Existing acute treatments for migraine are generally covered or reimbursed by third-party payers and, based on preliminary primary market research we have conducted with certain third-party payers, we believe that STS101, if approved, would qualify for coverage and reimbursement substantially similar to other branded acute treatments for migraine; however, such research is preliminary and we cannot guarantee the availability of coverage or adequacy of reimbursement at this time.
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. By way of example, in the United States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers

under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional congressional action. In addition, in March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which, among other things, eliminated the statutory cap on drug manufacturers’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebate liability, effective January 1, 2024.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 25 employees, all of whom were full-time. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 On March 27, 2023, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce by 9 employees, or approximately 36% of our headcount as of such date, in order to preserve cash and maximize the value of STS101 for a potential strategic transaction partner. This reduction in force will be effective as of March 31, 2023.

We have one primary business activity and operate one reportable segment.


Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in South San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 4,148 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease dated January 9, 2018, which continues through April 30, 2023. We do not intend to renew or extend this lease. In addition, we lease approximately 5,043 square feet of office space in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina pursuant to a lease dated August 1, 2019, which continues through July 31, 2025. We believe these facilities are sufficient for our near-term needs. We believe the biotechnology environment in the South San Francisco area offers suitable additional space on commercially reasonable terms to enable expansion, if needed.
