Item 1. Business.
Overview
Quotient Technology Inc. is an industry leading digital media and promotions technology company that creates cohesive omnichannel brand-building and sales-driving marketing campaigns for consumer-packaged goods (“CPGs") companies and retailers throughout the path to purchase. These programs are delivered through our platforms across our broad network of digital properties to drive measurable sales and customer loyalty. Our network includes the digital properties of our retail partners and CPG customers, social media platforms, third-party properties, our flagship consumer brand Coupons.com properties and digital out-of-home ("DOOH") properties. This network provides Quotient with proprietary and licensed data, including retailers’ in-store point-of-sale (“POS”) shopper data, purchase intent and online behavior, location intelligence, to deliver more valuable outcomes for CPGs, retailers, and consumers. Customers and partners use Quotient to leverage consumer data, and insights, consumers via digital channels, and integrate marketing and merchandising programs, and to drive measurable sales results.
For our retail partners, we provide Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform, formerly known as Quotient Retailer iQ, and Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform, to directly engage with shoppers across their websites, mobile, eCommerce, and social channels. These platforms are generally co-branded or white-labeled through retailers’ savings or loyalty programs and use shopper data to deliver relevant digital media and promotions solutions from brand marketers and retailers to consumers. By partnering with Quotient, retailers can leverage their proprietary sales data and digital properties to build new alternative revenue streams and offer effective marketing opportunities for their brand partners to engage consumers, all while measuring the impact of every partnership.
Our network is made up of three constituencies:
•Our customers consist of approximately 800 CPGs, representing over 2,000 brands, including many of the leading food, beverage, personal care and household product manufacturers;
•Our retail partners, represent multiple classes of trade such as leading grocery retailers, drug, mass merchant, dollar, club, and convenience merchandise channels, where most CPGs' products are sold; and
•Millions of consumers who visit our websites, mobile properties, and social channels, as well as those of our CPGs and retailer partners.
Through these three groups, we have created a network effect, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over both offline and online competitors. As our consumer audience increases, our platforms become more valuable to CPGs and their brands and retailers, which, in turn, rely more heavily on our platforms for their digital media and promotions. In addition, the breadth of media and promotion content offered from leading brands enables us to attract and retain more retailers and shoppers. As our network expands, we generate more consumer data and insights, which improves our ability to deliver more relevant, targeted and personalized media and promotions, and strengthens our measurement and data insights solutions.
We primarily generate revenue by using our technology platforms to create, target, deliver, analyze and measure digital media and/or promotional programs for our CPG customers, retail partners and advertising agencies. Using shopper data from our retail partners and our proprietary data and audience segments, we deliver targeted and/or personalized digital media and promotions to shoppers through our network, including our websites and mobile applications, as well as those of our publishers, retail partners and other third-party properties. As our customers and partners shift more of their marketing spend to digital channels, our solutions help them optimize the performance of such digital channels. Our solutions' performance is measured by attribution of digital campaigns to retail purchases in near real time, demonstrating return on spend for our customers and partners.
Our promotional products include digital paperless coupons, digital print coupons, in-lane on receipt promotions, digital rebates and loyalty offers. Our media solutions include display, social, DOOH, Retailer.com display and sponsored search, shoppable brand pages, and audiences. A growing number of campaigns our customers purchase are purchased as an integrated campaign which combines a mix of digital media and/or promotions solutions in a single campaign. The revenue we earn from these programs is generally based on cost-per-click, cost-per-impression, or cost-per-acquisition. 
We also generate revenues from our Specialty Retail business, in which specialty stores including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others offer coupon codes that we distribute digitally. 
We generally pay a distribution fee or revenue share to retailers and publishers for activation or redemption of a digital promotion, for media campaigns, and for use of data for targeting or measurement. We also pay a fee to third-party publishers for traffic acquisition, which consists of delivering campaigns on certain networks or properties. These distribution, revenue share and third-party service fees are included in our cost of revenues.
During 2020, we generated revenues of $445.9 million, representing 2% growth over 2019, and a net loss of $65.4 million in 2020 as compared to $37.1 million in 2019. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there was no customer that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was one customer that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there was no customer that accounted for greater than 10% of our total revenues.
Our Industry
CPGs and retailers continue to turn to data-driven digital marketing strategies to engage and influence shoppers to compete more effectively in today’s retail environment and drive sales. By shifting dollars from traditional offline channels to digital, CPGs and retailers can use consumer data and behaviors to target and deliver digital media and promotions with greater efficiency and return on investment.
For decades, brands and retailers have been focused on driving sales. However, only recently have they started to work more collaboratively to increase sales and revenue, which in turn benefits both parties. CPGs sell their products to retailers, and retailers are responsible for selling those products directly to consumers. To help retailers attract consumers and ensure sales, CPGs spend over $225 billion annually in promotions, media, shopper marketing, trade and other in-store advertising. Excluding trade and certain other budgets from the $225 billion results in approximately $117 billion which we believe is addressable on Quotient's network through our comprehensive solutions. Additionally, we continue to see a shift from offline to digital which continues to be a tailwind for our business. Historically, the vast majority of CPGs budgets have been spent in offline channels such as free-standing inserts found in newspapers, direct mail, printed circulars, in-store aisle tags, end caps and television. These traditional offline channels continue to become less effective as consumers spend more time online, particularly on mobile devices, giving way to the rising importance of using data to drive personalized and targeted, content to consumers. To reach consumers at the right time and place, more now than ever, CPGs are shifting dollars historically spent in offline channels to digital channels for both promotions and media.
At the same time, traditional retailers are paving the path for this digital shift by utilizing technology and creating digital strategies to better compete and drive sales. This includes focusing on retail performance media, loyalty strategies, eCommerce experiences, and data-driven media platforms, many of which Quotient powers for its retailers and partners. As retailers expand their digital capabilities, and shoppers increase their digital engagement through more eCommerce purchases or a mixed mode of on-line and in-store purchases, it creates greater opportunities for CPGs to shift marketing dollars from offline to digital as well as greater collaboration between the two parties.
Digital promotions, primarily funded by CPGs, have been found to be more effective and are redeemed at higher rates compared to traditional offline promotions. We believe that the ease of digital promotions, coupled with greater awareness of digital savings programs and increased demand for digital promotions, is broadening the demographic reach and driving continued momentum for digital promotions.
Digital media and promotions from consumer marketing spend funded by the CPGs to gain consumer awareness and drive sales within a specific retailer, also continues to shift from traditional in-store and print promotions and media to digital, particularly to mobile. Consumer marketers are looking to reach consumers directly across the right touchpoints throughout the path to purchase. 
As the shift to digital media and promotions continues to grow, so does the importance placed on data to target audiences and measure campaign performance. As a greater portion of grocery sales have shifted to online, retailers are focused on implementing omnichannel strategies, technology, and solutions to meet consumer demands, compete effectively and drive sales. This is resulting in an increased number of digital touchpoints, using 
combined data from offline and online sales, for retailers and their CPGs to target shoppers with relevant promotions and digital marketing. As retailers add more omnichannel capabilities, brands are able to shift more marketing dollars to digital.

These techniques enable us to optimize the delivery of promotions across the network and drive campaign performance.
Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform (for retailers)
Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform, our proprietary and core platform, is used by top retailers in the grocery, drug, mass merchant, dollar, club and convenience merchandise channels to integrate into their POS systems, or loyalty program, which serves as their digital marketing platform, to create a direct, digital relationship with millions of their shoppers and an omnichannel experience. Through the Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform, we use consumer data and insights to distribute personalized and targeted media and promotions, primarily funded by our advertiser (brand) customers, to help drive consumer loyalty and increase sales. Additional solutions on this platform include personalized e-mails, targeted in-lane promotions at checkout, loyalty rewards, rebate offers, digital grocery list, digital receipts, branding landing pages, and digital circular.

For example, we can target consumers on Facebook who have redeemed a promotion or purchased a product in a particular product category with advertising within that product category.
Our media solutions include display, social, DOOH, Retailer.com and sponsored search, shoppable brand pages and audiences.
Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform (for retailers)
Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform ("RPM"), provides retailers with the technology to build a sustainable omnichannel strategy leveraging the retailer's consumer data to drive sales and enhance the shopper experience. Through RPM, brand marketers can use specific retail data to target and deliver media directly to shoppers and measure direct sales results.

Quotient Analytics 
Quotient Analytics provides campaign analytics and measured sales results to brands and retailers, attributing digital promotions and/or media campaigns to in-store and online purchases. Through Quotient Analytics, we combine purchase data from select retailers across the Quotient Retailer Promotion Platform and/or the Quotient Retailer Performance Media Platform with online engagement and purchase-intent data from Quotient’s flagship brand, Coupons.com, and the Company’s thousands of publishing partners. Our campaign measurement tools also provide brands and retailers with flexibility to adjust their campaigns in mid-flight to drive greater efficiency with marketing dollars. This capability and analysis is provided to customers who utilize our Promotions and Media Platforms. It provides the basis for our calculations to CPGs on their Return-on-Ad-Spend and Return-on-Promotion-Spend. As our platform, network and audience expands, the value of our data and analytics increases. 
Quotient Consumer Properties
Our consumer properties complement our offerings and enable us to deliver critical capabilities. We provide CPGs and other parties access to our Coupons.com, Coupons.com Brandcaster and Shopmium audiences, including our website and mobile properties, to market their brands, including premium media and product placements on our site, promoted positions within our coupon galleries and premium placement in our marketing efforts.

Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our platforms and our business through the following key strategies:
Increase revenues from CPGs already on our platforms as well as expand our CPG base . 
From our experience to date, we believe we have opportunities to continue increasing revenues from our existing customer base through:
•increasing our share of CPG spending on overall media and promotions by providing them a high return on their marketing investments and deploying larger digital marketing budgets as CPGs move off-line spend to on-line digital marketing spend;
•increasing the number of brands that are using our platforms within each CPG;
•leveraging data to provide our customers and partners with more insights, including campaign performance, and to distribute more targeted promotions, media, and analytics across our retail partner properties, our network including our owned and operated properties, and third-party sites; and
•maximizing consumer experiences across all products.
Increase the growing number of smaller CPGs that use, or desire to use our solutions. 
We believe we have the opportunity to capture this revenue through:
•a dedicated sales team focused on smaller CPGs; and
•leveraging our solutions and retailer platforms to provide this segment of customers with digital opportunities on a national and shopper level versus traditional solutions that they have not had the ability to participate in, such as the offline free-standing insert (FSI), due to their market size.
Grow our digital promotions business.      We plan to grow our digital promotions business through increased consumer demand of promotions, and by increasing the number of promotions that brands offer on our platforms leveraging the shift from offline to digital promotional channels. Additionally, smaller advertisers who have been excluded from the FSI are taking advantage of digital solutions for promotions. By bringing retailers and shoppers into our network, our ability to expand our targeted promotions and expand our audience reach grows, increasing our ability to more effectively engage consumers and drive sales. We plan to continue to expand our shopper adoption on Quotient Retailer Promotions Platform with our solutions, such as national promotions, targeted digital paperless promotions, targeted in-lane promotions at checkout, brand loyalty promotions, and our national rebate offering.  
Grow our digital media business.     As the industry continues to see eCommerce growth, the market for our digital media capabilities grows. We plan to capitalize on this through our digital media business, including Quotient RPM, programmatic display, social, DOOH, and our self-service sponsored search product as we see continued demand for these offerings from CPGs and our retail partners. We plan to continue to innovate and invest in our media solutions, expanding the use of our proprietary data as well as data from select exclusive retail partnerships, 
and by adding and expanding relationships, including national media buyers and publishers, new partnerships, verticals, and third parties such as media agencies.
Offer more integrated digital media and promotions solutions. We continue to focus our sales strategy on further integrating digital media and promotions, including selling these offerings together through packaged solutions. We believe that brand spend on digital media and promotions will continue to grow as POS, mobile channels and social media offer new opportunities to engage consumers on their path to purchase.
Grow our retailer network and add retailers in new verticals.    We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number of retailers that we partner with, thereby increasing the value of our platforms to all constituents. Also, we intend to continue growing our network with the addition of retailers outside of our core verticals in new verticals for our platform.
Grow international operations.    Many CPGs and retailers on our platforms have global operations and we believe that we can opportunistically grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and partner with our existing clients to enter new geographies in which they operate. We also plan to leverage our existing presence in France and the UK through our mobile application Shopmium, a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform, to develop further international opportunities.
Fraud Prevention and Distribution Controls
Our platforms include a proprietary digital distribution management system to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for linking coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique ID that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique ID also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platforms allow us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons. We also have a proprietary rebate distribution solution with built in authentication capabilities through phone and payment verification. We have transactional level controls across rebate portfolio to enforce stacking rules and prevent receipt alteration and/or manipulation. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. We believe that our sales, integration, digital media and promotions campaign management and analytics, customer success and support capabilities are difficult to replicate and a key reason for the growth and success of our business. Our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands within existing and new CPG customers, including smaller CPGs, that offer digital media and promotions through our platforms as well as increasing the revenue from those brands currently using our platform. The team is also focused on expanding relationships within CPGs to include consumer marketing and digital media teams, where we believe there is a large opportunity for growth particularly in media. Additionally, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our publishing and partner network. We are also seeking to partner with retailers in our non-core verticals.
In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers to ensure that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified time frames. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.
We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new pipeline from both CPGs and retailers. We often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team runs targeted digital marketing programs, develops data-led collateral and customer case studies, sponsors and conducts research, and delivers engaging content through social media channels. We are dedicated to growing our engaged consumer user base for Coupons.com through channels including paid media, search engine optimization, and public relations. This team is responsible for the acquisition, retention and ongoing engagement of users to increase our monthly promotions activations through Coupons.com.
Technology and Infrastructure
Since inception, we have made significant investments and will continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary platforms aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on solutions that provide measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and data scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include:
•Scalable infrastructure.    We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business, regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platforms as we scale our business without requiring any material design or architecture modifications. We use a combination of public and private cloud computing platforms. Our private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across data centers in co-location facilities in California and Virginia.
•Redundancy.    Our critical production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to the other data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site provide fast recovery whenever it is requested. Each data center has been designed to handle more than our entire server needs, which enables us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact.
•Reporting.    Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide campaign insights.
•AdTech.    Our media delivery is largely powered by proprietary ad servers, creative and social platforms, workflow automation tools, and data management tools.  We develop and use these platforms with a range of differentiated features that are specialized for the CPG and retail industries.
•Security.    Our security policy adheres to established policies to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it.
Competition
We compete against a variety of different businesses with respect to different aspects of our business, including:
•providers of digital promotions such as Valassis’ Redplum.com, Catalina Marketing Corporation’s Cellfire, Inmar/You Technology, Neptune Retail Services' (formerly known as News America Marketing) SmartSource; companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc., Neptune Retail Services' Checkout 51;
•companies providing other e-commerce based services that allow consumers to obtain direct or indirect discounts on purchases; and companies that offer coupon codes such as RetailMeNot, Inc., which recently entered into an agreement to be purchased by J2 Global, Inc., Groupon, Inc., Exponential Interactive, Inc.’s TechBargains.com, Savings.com, Inc., Honey Science Corporation, which was recently acquired by PayPal Holdings, Inc., and Rakuten, Inc.;
•offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in free standing inserts or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., Neptune Retail Services and Catalina Marketing Corporation;
•retailers who develop and manage digital advertising or data products in-house, such as The Kroger Company with its wholly owned subsidiary of 84.51°; 
•internet sites and blogs that are focused on specific communities or interests that offer promotions or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests;
•companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and CPGs, such as MyWebGrocer, Inc. and Flipp Corp.; and
•companies offering digital advertising technology, inventory, data, and services solutions for CPGs and retailers including Alphabet, Inc., Facebook, Inc., Pinterest, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Adobe Inc., The Trade Desk, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Criteo S.A., Microsoft Corporation, and others; 
We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company’s competitive advantage in our market include the following:
•scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting CPGs and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other online properties;
•scale and reach of our retailer network; 
•scale and reach of our targetable audience data;
•ability to attract consumers to our platform;
•platform security, usability, scalability, reliability and availability;
•integration with retailer applications, point of sales systems, and consumer channels;
•access to consumer data;
•measurement that demonstrates the effectiveness of campaigns; 
•quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of digital marketing campaigns;
•integration of products and solutions;
•rapid deployment of products and services for customers;
•breadth, quality and relevance of our solutions;
•ability to deliver high quality and increase number of digital promotions that are widely available and easy to use in consumers’ preferred form;
•brand recognition and reputation; and 
•ability to recruit, retain, and train employees.
While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger or more established companies that seek to enter our market or from smaller companies that launch new products, solutions and services that could gain market acceptance.
Human Capital Resources
Our long-term business success is driven by technological innovation, customer service, as well as operational and functional excellence. Attracting, developing and retaining top talent are critical to these long-term business success and are a key focus of the executive team. Our culture is underpinned by a newly defined set of core values that are integrated throughout our company and define how employees and leaders operate and interact. We recognize and celebrate our employees who champion our values through a newly established quarterly employee recognition program where employees are nominated by their peers for exemplary work demonstrating our values.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our workforce, with a large majority of our employees working remotely since mid-March 2020. To support employees while working from home, we offered Wi-Fi reimbursement, expanded home office equipment support, provided several health and wellness programs and converted training offerings to a virtual format. We instituted a phased return-to-office plan with safety protocols and procedures outlined in a detailed Return-to-Office playbook. No employee layoffs that occurred in 2020 were related directly to COVID-19. 
We continued to strategically hire during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,163 full-time employees, consisting of 701 employees in the United States and 462 employees internationally. In 2020, a newly designed global onboarding program was introduced to enhance the new hire experience, especially as employees onboarded remotely for most of the year. Voluntary workforce turnover was 13.6% in 2020. At the end of 2020, our global workforce was 48.1% female, a slight increase over 2019. Nearly 38% of our employees who hold a manager title and above are women, an increase from 2019. Women represented 50% of our executive leadership team. 
We are taking steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2020, we formed a 30-member diversity, equity and inclusion council focused on four key areas: Awareness and Education, Community Outreach, Recruitment and Development & Retention. At Quotient, we want everyone to feel valued and appreciated for their contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. 
We believe in cultivating high performing teams. In 2020, we launched a new performance management framework that aligns performance to reward and provides actionable feedback to employees. Twice a year, leaders commit to a comprehensive organization and talent review process, covering key elements such as organization structure, employee performance and potential, talent pipelines and development. We offer employees a free subscription to a leading learning platform to develop skills for current and future roles, as well as other online and facilitator-led learning opportunities. 
We have a long-standing culture of helping local communities and neighbors through our philanthropic program. The program’s mission is to provide communities with tangible outcomes, leaving a positive legacy for future generations’ through the use of our time, talent, and technology. In 2020, we participated in virtual volunteer and community building events aimed at supporting local neighborhoods impacted by COVID-19 and organizations focused on supporting underrepresented groups. 
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and equivalent rights in other jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we hold or have exclusive rights to 44 active issued patents in the United States and 30 active patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2022 and 2038.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective or may require significant expenditures and other resources to enforce. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could harm our business and our operating results, or ability to compete.
Companies in Internet-related and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to in the past, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
