ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Groupon is a global scaled two-sided marketplace that connects consumers to merchants. Consumers access our marketplace through our mobile applications and our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries. We operate in two segments, North America and International, and in three categories, Local, Goods and Travel. Our mission is to be the destination where consumers discover fun things to do and local businesses thrive. For our customers, this means giving them an amazing selection of experiences at great values. For our merchants, this means making it easy for them to partner with Groupon and reach millions of consumers around the world. 
Currently, we generate product and service revenue from the following business operations. 
Service Revenue from Local, Travel, and Goods Categories: Service revenue primarily represents the net commissions earned from selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Service revenue is reported on a net basis as the purchase price collected from the customer less the portion of the purchase price that is payable to the third-party merchant. We also earn commissions when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications. 
Product Revenue from Goods Category: We generate product revenue from our sales of first-party Goods inventory, which are direct sales of merchandise inventory. For product revenue transactions, we are the primary party responsible for providing the good to the customer, we have inventory risk and we have discretion in establishing prices. As such, product revenue is reported on a gross basis as the purchase price received from the customer. Product revenue, including associated shipping revenue, is recognized when title passes to the customer upon delivery of the product. We have transitioned to a third-party marketplace in North America as of the end of 2020 and will begin to transition to a third-party marketplace in International in the second quarter 2021. Following the International transition, we expect our Goods category to primarily generate revenue on a net basis within service revenue.

Our Strategy
In the third quarter 2020, we shifted our strategy and plan to prioritize expanding our Local inventory and modernizing our marketplace by improving the merchant and customer experiences. While both of these are important to building a successful marketplace, we believe the most critical of these is expanding Local inventory.
Our Categories
Local. Our Local category includes offerings from local and national merchants, and other revenue sources that are primarily generated through our relationships with local and national merchants, including advertising revenue. Our offerings comprise multiple subcategories of local experiences, including: things to do; beauty and wellness; and dining. In addition to local and national offerings, we give consumers the ability to access digital coupons from thousands of retailers through our coupons offering. 
Goods. In our Goods category, we earn product revenue from transactions in which we sell merchandise inventory directly to customers, as well as service revenue from transactions in which third-party merchants sell products to customers through our marketplaces. When our transition to a third-party Goods marketplace is complete, we will primarily recognize Goods transaction revenue on a net basis within service revenue. Our Goods category currently offers merchandise across multiple product lines, including electronics, sporting goods, jewelry, toys, household items and apparel. 
Travel. Through our Travel category, we feature travel offers at both discounted and market rates, including hotels, airfare and package deals covering both domestic and international travel. For many of our travel offerings, the customer must contact the merchant directly to make a travel reservation after purchasing a travel voucher from us. However, for some of our hotel offerings, customers make room reservations directly through our websites.
Distribution
Our customers access our online local commerce marketplaces through our mobile applications and our websites, which primarily consist of localized groupon.com sites in many countries. Our applications and mobile websites enable consumers to browse, purchase, manage and redeem deals on their mobile devices. For the year ended December 31, 2020, over 75% of our global transactions were completed on mobile devices.
We use a variety of marketing channels to direct customers to the offerings available through these marketplaces, as described in the Marketing section below.
Marketing
We primarily use marketing to acquire and retain customers and promote awareness of our marketplaces. In light of the impact of COVID-19 on our business in 2020, we significantly reduced marketing expense due to lower consumer demand and by shortening payback thresholds and delaying brand marketing investments. We would expect our marketing spend to increase as consumer demand recovers. 
We use a variety of marketing channels to make customers aware of our offerings, including search engines, email and push notifications, affiliate channels, social and display advertising and offline marketing.
Search engines. Customers can access our offerings indirectly through third-party search engines. We use search engine optimization ("SEO") and search engine marketing ("SEM") to increase the visibility of our offerings in web search results. 
Email and push notifications. We communicate offerings through email and by push notifications to our customers based on their locations and personal preferences. A customer who interacts with an email or push notification is directed to our website or mobile application to learn more about the deal and to make a purchase.
Affiliate channels. We have an affiliate program that uses third parties to promote our offerings online. Affiliates earn commissions when customers access our offerings through links on their websites and make purchases on our platform. We expect to continue to leverage affiliate relationships to extend our deals to a broad base of potential customers. 
Social and display. We publish offerings through various social networks and adapt our notifications to the particular format of each of these social networking platforms. Our websites and mobile applications enable consumers to share our offerings with their personal social networks. We also promote our offerings using display advertising on websites.
Television and other offline. We use offline marketing such as television advertising, and to a lesser extent, print and radio advertising, to help build awareness of our offerings and brand. 
Our marketing activities also include elements that are not presented as Marketing on our consolidated statements of operations, such as order discounts and free shipping on qualifying merchandise sales.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had employees consisting of the following: 

 | Sales | Corporate, Operational and Customer Support | | Total Employees
North America | 550 | | 774 | | 1,324
International | 726 | | 2,109 | | 2,835
Total | 1,276 | | 2,883 | | 4,159

Our sales force consists of merchant sales representatives and sales support staff who acquire and build merchant relationships and provide ongoing consultative expertise. Other key operational functions include engineering, product, marketing, and editorial. 
We believe attracting and retaining global talent is key to our success. Our Chief People Officer, together with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, are responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy, with oversight of the Board and Board committees. This includes the recruitment, development, and retention of talent to support our operations and execute our strategy and the design of our employee compensation and benefit programs. 
Key areas of our focus include:
Inclusion and Diversity. Inclusion and diversity is important to all aspects of our business, and particularly vital to attracting, developing and retaining employees from underrepresented groups. We believe that by building a global team of employees who have diverse experiences, backgrounds, skills and perspectives, we will be able to better support our employees, merchants and customers. We have established multiple internal diversity and inclusion resources that allow employees to engage on important issues. Some of these resources include business resource groups and resource action groups (Listen, Learn, Mobilize, and Support) that are focused on the Black Lives Matters movement. In addition to these resources, we invest in our mentoring and leadership programs as well as other events that are specifically focused on nurturing the professional development of our diverse employees, showcasing growth opportunities within Groupon, and providing them with unique tools and experiences they need to thrive at Groupon. 
Workplace Culture and Values. To support talent development, we offer training and development programs supporting our ethics, workplace culture and managers. For example, we require our employees to complete unconscious bias training and Code of Conduct training. In addition, all managers must complete Respect In the Workplace Training. We also offer various other training programs to employees, such as, Change & Resilience, Managing Through Change, FS90 (leader habits and manager expectations for new leaders) and Authentic Allyship Workshops. We also encourage internal referrals and postings for open roles and partner with organizations in order to proactively recruit more candidates from diverse backgrounds. 
Social Responsibility. Social responsibility is important at Groupon, and we empower our employees to volunteer and participate in the communities in which we operate and live. We believe thriving local communities are good for everyone. Further, our efforts in this area support the success of our core Local business. We provide numerous opportunities for our employees to volunteer with causes they care about throughout the year and support local communities through our platform and community development efforts.
In 2020, our business was significantly impacted by COVID-19. We implemented changes in our workforce and how we work in response to the pandemic. For example, we instituted a remote work plan and most of our employees have been working remotely since early 2020. We continue to evaluate our return to office plans, with the health and safety of our employees being a primary consideration. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, our Board approved a multi-phase restructuring plan that includes the termination and furlough of employees. See Item 8, Note 16, Restructuring and Related Charges, for additional information.
Technology
Our websites are hosted at two U.S. data centers in California and at an international data center in Ireland. Our data centers host our public-facing websites and applications, as well as our back-end business intelligence systems. We employ security practices to protect and maintain the systems located at our data centers. We are migrating our public-facing websites and applications and our back-end business intelligence systems to the cloud. We have invested in intrusion and anomaly detection tools to try to recognize intrusions to our websites. We engage independent third-party Internet security firms to regularly test the security of our websites and identify vulnerabilities. In financial transactions with customers conducted on our websites and mobile applications, we use data encryption protocols to secure information while in transit. See Risk Factors for additional information relating to potential cyber threats. 
Competition
Our customers and merchants are at the center of our two-sided marketplace. The quality and stability of both our customers and merchants are key to our business model. We face competition on both sides of our marketplace.
We compete with other marketplaces, and some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. In addition, we compete with companies who address only specific verticals in the local experiences market, and in some categories, such as Goods and Travel, companies who have greater scale and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer trends. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more effectively than we do.
We also compete with companies that can offer alternative services for our merchants. There are companies that offer other types of advertising and promotional services to local businesses. Our merchants could choose to leverage these other platforms to attract customers to their businesses. We believe we can compete due to the access we provide our merchants to our large customer base, our trusted brand, and the investments we are making in self-service tools that will allow merchants to manage demand more effectively and better attract and retain customers.
Seasonality
Historically, we experienced seasonal buying patterns mirroring that of the larger consumer retail and e-commerce markets, where demand increases during the fourth quarter holiday season. That seasonal pattern was less pronounced in 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. 
Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Additionally, those laws and regulations may be interpreted differently across domestic and foreign jurisdictions. As a company in a relatively new and rapidly innovating industry, we are exposed to the risk that many of those laws may evolve or be interpreted by regulators or in the courts in ways that could materially affect our business. Those laws and regulations may involve taxation, unclaimed property, intellectual property, product liability, travel, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, the provision of various online payment services, employee, merchant and customer privacy and data security or other areas.
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act"), as well as the laws of most states, contain provisions governing gift cards, gift certificates, stored value or pre-paid cards or coupons ("gift cards"). Groupon vouchers may be included within the definition of "gift cards" under many laws. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions have laws that govern disclosure and certain product terms and conditions, including restrictions on expiration dates and fees, that may apply to Groupon vouchers. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments that could affect us, and our global operations may be constrained by regulatory regimes and laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States that may be more restrictive and adversely impact our business.
Various U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the "Bank Secrecy Act"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and the CARD Act impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Those laws and regulations broadly define financial institutions to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value. Requirements imposed on financial institutions under those laws include customer identification and verification programs, record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting. We do not believe that we are a financial institution subject to those laws and regulations.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data. The General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which was adopted by the European Union and became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) which became effective January 1, 2020, require companies to satisfy specific requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its collection, use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to, among other things, access and/or delete such data about themselves. Our ongoing efforts to comply with the GDPR, CCPA and other relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations, have required updates to certain business practices and systems. Non-
compliance with any privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines. For instance, non-compliance with the GDPR could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. We continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations relating to privacy and consumer data, and we expect these evolving laws and regulations will continue to impact our business in the future.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to those contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names and patents to protect our intellectual property. Groupon and its related entities own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending in the United States and internationally. In addition, we own a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and internationally and own and have applied for copyright registrations in the United States.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in the Internet, technology and other industries as well as non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks or other intellectual property rights and may request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, lawsuits and allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. As our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement, and may experience an adverse result which could impact our business and/or our operating results.
We have received in the past, and we anticipate we will receive in the future, communications alleging that items offered or sold through our website infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents and trade names or other intellectual property rights or that we have otherwise infringed third parties’ past, current or future intellectual property rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from offering and selling unlawful or infringing goods or goods of disputed authenticity, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by third parties through our website. We may implement measures in an effort to protect against these potential liabilities that could require us to spend substantial resources and/or to reduce revenue by discontinuing certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business.
