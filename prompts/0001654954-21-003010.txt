  Super League has a mission to empower passionate players and creators through proprietary tools to create gaming-centric content that inspires connectivity and engagement for the greater good of gaming. We offer brands and advertisers the opportunity to create meaningful connections with one of the most sought-after audiences in today’s media landscape – the engaged young gamer. We generate revenues from (i) advertising, serving as a marketing channel for brands and advertisers to reach their target audiences of gamers across our network, (ii) content, curating and distributing esports and entertainment content for our own network of digital channels and media and entertainment partner channels, and (iii) direct to consumer offers including digital subscriptions, digital goods, gameplay access fees and merchandise sales.
  
  Our Business
  
  We are a leading gaming community and content platform that gives everyday players and creators multiple ways to connect and engage with others while enjoying the video games they love. Our platform offers competitive video gaming experiences, esports entertainment and social connections to the large and underserved global audience of what is estimated by Statista to be approximately three billion gamers by the end of 2021. Our focus is the avid, everyday, competitive amateur player and related audience, representing the middle of the esports player pyramid, as follows:
The Esports Player Pyramid  
  
 ______________________
  * Based on the average esports viewer, Nielsen Esports Playbook, 2017.
  
  As a first-mover in defining the esports category for the everyday gamer since 2015, we believe Super League is on the leading edge of the rapidly growing competitive video gaming industry, which has become an established and vital part of the entertainment landscape. We believe there is a significant opportunity for the world of mainstream competitive players who want their own esports experience. These gamers are players who enjoy the competition, the social interaction and community, and the entertainment value associated with playing and watching others play.
  
  Super League is a critically important component in providing the infrastructure for mainstream competitive video gaming content and gameplay, that is synergistic and accretive to the greater esports ecosystem. Over the past five years, we believe we have become the preeminent brand for gamers, by providing a proprietary software platform that allows them to create, compete, socialize and spectate gameplay and entertainment, both physically and digitally online. In addition, our creator and player platform generates a significant amount of derivative gameplay content for further syndication beyond our own digital channels.
  
  The fundamental driver of our business model and monetization strategy is creating deep community engagement through our highly personalized experiences that, when coupled with the critical mass of our large digital audiences, provides the depth and volume for premium content and offer monetization differentiated from a more traditional, commoditized advertising model. The combination of our physical venue network and digital programming channels, with Super League’s cloud-based, digital products platform technology at the hub, creates the opportunity for not just a share of the player’s wallet, but also the advertiser’s wallet. We do this by offering brand sponsors and advertisers a premium marketing channel to reach elusive Generation Z and Millennial gamers and creators and offering players ways to access exclusive tournaments and programming.
  
 Our products range from offers that speak to a wide market of competitive gamers through always on, highly participatory and social gameplay, as well as offers that ladder to our more heightened competitions and broadcasts. We work closely with top-tier game publishers and brands to bring premium esports entertainment to this under-served market of Generation Z and Millennial for both the players and the viewers.

In addition, our digital properties provide a level of scale that can complement our physical esports events, which bring players and spectators together across the U.S., both digitally and physically. Live experiences provide another source of content to augment our digital content library for what we believe can be a next generation esports and entertainment content network.

  Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
  
 The KPIs driving our business model are related to scalable offers across our digital and physical footprint of gaming-centric offers and entertainment. The significant growth we achieved in 2020 in part, reflects the advancement of our technology platform, and the acceleration of our audience growth through the expansion of our digital network of online gameplay and viewing channels. A summary of KPIs, and related growth for fiscal year 2020, compared to fiscal year 2019 is as follows:

 Monetization
  
 
  Advertising and Sponsorships
  
 The highly sought after Millennial and Generation Z audience is increasingly difficult for brands to reach due to the proliferation of new content distribution channels, ad-blocking technology and a sentiment against overt marketing and promotion. Our ability to uniquely aggregate a diverse user base across age ranges, skill levels and game titles and embed direct authentic brand integrations creates a base of high-quality, premium advertising inventory attractive to brands and advertisers. We stand for inclusive, fair and fun gameplay and entertainment and believe that our brand is at the forefront of the mainstreaming of competitive gaming and esports entertainment, which provides a positive access point for both endemic and non-endemic brands to reach these audiences.
  
 Throughout 2020, we experienced significant growth in our audience, increasing viewership and registered users, and expanded our premium advertising inventory. We further developed our in-house direct sales capability to monetize this ad inventory, as well as increasing revenues generated from programmatic display and video advertising units. We expect to continue to grow our adverting pipeline across various verticals with the capability to give brands and advertisers with targeted, high quality integrations that warrant premium costs per impressions (“CPM”) advertising rates.
   
  Advertising and sponsorship revenue primarily consists of direct sales activity along with programmatic advertising. The various forms of advertising campaigns for competitive video gaming and esports entertainment, digitally and physically, include:
  
 
● | Master brand sponsorships;
--+---------------------------


● | Tournament and game specific sponsorships;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | City Club sponsorships;
--+------------------------


● | Custom digital programs for brands and advertisers both in-stream and in-game; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Video and display programmatic advertising.

  Content
  
  Content related revenue is generated in connection with our curation and distribution of esports and entertainment content for our own network of digital channels and media and entertainment partner channels. We distribute three primary types of content for syndication and licensing, including: (1) our own original programming content, (2) user generated content (“UGC”), including online gameplay and gameplay highlights, and (3) the creation of content for third parties utilizing our remote production and broadcast technology.
  
  We generate revenues from our proprietary content by utilizing this content to drive audience growth across our network and expand our premium advertising inventory. In addition, the UGC can be repackaged for further syndication and monetization to third-parties seeking esports and entertainment content for their own distribution channels. Tens of millions of hours of proprietary content is generated through our platform per year providing us with a sizable library of esports entertainment content.
  
  Additionally, we generate revenues from third-party partners who seek our patented remote production and broadcast technology to create content for their own digital channels to drive audience engagement. From consumer brands and media companies, to game publishers and professional esports teams, Virtualis Studios offers a fully virtual, cloud-based production and broadcast studio providing proprietary, state-of-the-art, scalable solutions for video, television, and branded content. Virtualis Studios’ is designed to enable thousands of simultaneous gameplay and player cam feeds to be live streamed across dozens of endpoints, and the integration of multiple technology solutions to ensure any given project can be produced and monitored successfully on a partially or fully-remote basis.
  
  Direct to Consumer
  
  Direct to consumer revenues are primarily comprised of revenues generated from our Minehut digital property, which provides various Minecraft server hosting services on a subscription basis, and other digital goods to the Minecraft gaming community. Gamers and creators typically begin their relationship with Super League by viewing content on our digital network, registering an email address, and/or by participating in a free-to-play experience. Users become more engaged by creating a profile to join our network of players and creators and share more information about their gaming interests and other attributes. Joining Super League and Minehut is free, but we continue to focus on the monetization of gamers as activity grows, with premium digital offers experiences to expand their gameplay experience in the form of digital subscriptions, digital goods and gameplay access fees.
 Our Vision
  
 Our vision is to make Super League Gaming a vital brand in the lives of everyday gamers and creators. While the games are digital, our players are human. In a world of increasing de-socialization, we believe players and creators are increasingly seeking new ways to create and share their content and deepen their bonds to each other in their preferred virtual worlds. Our community platform provides the tools to allow our players and creators around the world to compete, socialize, share and spectate competitive video gaming and esports entertainment.
 Industry 
  
 The consumer appetite for esports continues to grow at a rapid pace with passionate fans across the globe. According to Grandview Research (2020), the overall value of the global gaming market was $168.0 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to grow to approximately $300.0 billion by 2027, representing a CAGR of 8% from 2020 to 2027. Key trends fueling this growth include:

● | the democratization of content creation and rise of live streaming;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | game design that is inherently competitive and cross-platform;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased accessibility through cloud-based gaming and 5G broadband;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the further establishment of professional esports teams and leagues; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | multi-generational and mass participatory gaming.
--+--------------------------------------------------


 
 Esports, a term generally used to refer to competitive video game play by professional players, have been around for as long as the video game industry itself. However, recent growth in the gaming audience and player engagement has elevated esports into mainstream culture with a massive global following that, in some instances, exceeds the monthly audience of large professional sports leagues. According to Grandview Research the professional esports market totaled $1.5 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to $6.8 billion by 2027, representing a 24% CAGR over the period from 2020 to 2027. The significant growth in viewership, audience reach and engagement activities, increasing infrastructure for the esports tournaments, the growth in live streaming of games, and investments in the space are key factors driving the market growth. Professionalization in the industry has created value and opportunities for game developers, gamers, influencers, creators and event organizers. Millennials are increasingly considering esports as a professional career and universities and colleges are starting dedicated esports curriculums to develop skilled professionals.
  
 Additionally, there has been significant growth in the global esports audience since 2017, primarily due to growing awareness, the rise of live streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming Live, infrastructure developments and the growth of mobile. According to Newzoo the global esports audience was 454.0 million in 2019, and is expected to grow to 645.0 million in 2022, representing a 14% CAGR from 2017 to 2022. In 2020, 93.0 billion minutes were watched per month on Twitch, and increase of 69%, compared to 2019 (TwitchTracker). In the third quarter of 2020, 33.6 billion minutes were watched per month on YouTube Gaming Live (Statista).

  Our Opportunity
  
 Despite the significant growth potential outlined above, there are several key challenges facing stakeholders in the esports and entertainment landscape:
  
 
● | Sponsors and Advertisers are limited in their channels to reach the “cord cutting” Generation Z and Millennials due to the increasing fragmentation of content distribution and use of advertising-blocking technology. Given these demographic groups consume most content online, brands are challenged to target these audiences in an authentic way and achieve efficient marketing spend.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mainstream Competitive Players and Creators are a highly fragmented, often anonymous community with limited ways to find gamers and creators of similar skill-level and gaming interest online and locally. In addition, the limited recreational esports infrastructure results in few experiences with limited clear paths to the professional esports level for players and creators who wish to develop and test their skills while forging social connections.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Game Publishers must find alternative methods to attract new gamer and creator audiences to their game titles and offer premium experiences that drive greater retention. The lack of diversity in gaming, along with increased competition amongst titles, requires marketing partnerships to extend the lifecycle and franchise value of their intellectual property.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Venue Operators, including restaurants and retailers, must grow same-store sales in order to capture new sources of foot-traffic and deeper customer loyalty. Millennials and Generation Z generally value experiences, but tend to purchase more content and products online, making them an attractive demographic to widen a venue’s customer base and improve asset utilization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Professional Esports Teams and Owners have made significant investments in their teams and must rapidly develop a fanbase to achieve franchise values similar to traditional sports teams. However, there is no formal structure to identify the next generation of esports professionals to build their long-term rosters to support long-term fan loyalty.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 Our platform offers the following solutions for these key stakeholders:
  
 
● | For Sponsors and Advertisers, our platform provides a highly targeted marketing channel that offers a relevant path for brands to build affinity with the hard to reach, yet highly sought after, Generation Z and Millennial demographics. Based on our player data, we will have the ability to target audiences based on preferred game titles and other profile information for more efficient marketing spend.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For Mainstream Competitive Players and Creators, our technology and tools enable gameplay experiences, social connections and gaming-centric entertainment for the everyday gamer seeking new ways to compete or share their content and build their audience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For Game Publishers, our platform introduces their game titles to new audiences and drives retention by providing an immersive, premium way to play games, leading to deeper player engagement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For Venue Operators we provide access to our platform in order to operate esports experiences that enable these enterprises to attract new foot traffic, improve day-part utilization and drive same-store sales. In addition, we expect to provide venue operators with predictive customer activity information for more targeted offers to existing customers and our users. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For Professional Esports Teams and Owners, we cultivate the future professional esports fanbase through recreational competitive youth and young adult leagues, while providing an amateur feeder system as a path to the professional leagues. Looking forward, we will have a comprehensive set of data and tools to provide player analytics and progress skill levels.

  Our Scalable Technology Platform
  
  Our proprietary cloud-based platform provides competitive video gamers and content creators a modernized way to connect, play and view games in real-time and on-demand. We believe our platform will allow us to capture a large audience of gamers and their gameplay and viewing hours. Our platform aggregates a diverse audience of gamers and creators across multiple game titles and provides users with access to digital and physical competitive experiences and broadcasts that are accessible to a broad range of ages and demographics. Through our platform, we have three core components that enable differentiated and immersive gameplay at scale for both online and in-person experiences.
 Super League’s Scalable Technology Components 
  
 
 Our platform is focused on the customer journey and player discovery. Gamers and creators are introduced to Super League through our online digital channels and marketing or through our distributed network of venue partners, at which point they are encouraged to register for their profile and/or for an event through superleague.com or minehut.com. The platform allows for match-making, statistics and leaderboard management as well as the ultimate output of a livestream or on-demand broadcasts digitally and in-venue.
  
 Furthermore our platform enables digital tools for scale including, but not limited to data services, event creation and management, ecommerce, advertising technology, COPPA compliance, search engine optimization, email and mobile marketing, and our HUD automated, production and streaming technology. With respect to data services, the platform ingests from multiple data sources, including game publisher application programming interfaces (“API”), and offer a wide variety of gameplay experiences across multiple environments, often simultaneously, with a vast array of resulting content publishing opportunities. 
  
 Early in our inception, we utilized a local hardware solution to create interactive physical spaces, to create in-person gaming experiences for mainstream competitive gamers. We had two opportunities ahead of us for both scale and differentiation. Firstly, we further advanced our in-person event technology to be entirely cloud-based for scale and more rapid venue partner expansion. Secondly, we created a second-screen perspective that would make the experience more immersive for players and entertaining for spectators much like professional sporting events resulting in our Virtualis Studios, our patented, fully-remote visualization, production and broadcast technology.

 Virtualis Studios technology automates and scales various gameplay processes and functions that would otherwise need to be accomplished manually. These processes and functions primarily include ways to ensure that visualizations of gameplay and other value-added data and graphics are both captured and delivered efficiently and timely. For example, our proprietary software is used during our experiences to ensure that we are showing the most interesting aspects of gameplay, as well as switching to matches that are most relevant to the competition.  Further, we use computer vision to glean key events, graphics or data from the game screen, especially when the game publisher might not make such information available via an API:

This level of broadcast performance makes Virtualis Studios a scalable, affordable solution for media and entertainment partners for content product beyond competitive gaming and esports entertainment.

  Our Strengths
  
  We differentiate ourselves from potential competition by being a game and location agnostic software platform with a material digital audience reach, a large and growing registered user base of young, highly engaged players and creators, and strong brand, gaming and venue partners all targeting avid gamers. Our core strengths include the following:

● | Game Publisher Agreements provide access to existing user bases via partnerships with some of the largest game publishers. These partnerships bring players into our customer funnel providing direct to consumer sales opportunities. Our ability to interact with this highly attractive, engaged user base draws brands and sponsors to us to reach this otherwise hard-to-reach demographic.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary and Curated Content, reaching in the tens of millions of hours being generated through our platform per year, provides us with a unique perspective and library of recreational esports and entertainment content. This content is currently absent from the esports and entertainment ecosystem and is highly complementary and valuable to the needs of large on-demand and streaming video providers. Furthermore, the majority of this content is user-generated (“UGC”) with minimal production costs and can be easily ingested into our library via tools on our platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patented Technology allows for intelligent, scalable content capture enabling us to display the most relevant gameplay activity in real time along with broad visualization of active gameplay to facilitate a high quality playing and viewing experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Over Five Years of Brand and Technology Development provides us a strong, distinctive lead on followers with no obvious competitors in the holistic community, league operations and media platform category that also currently and directly own the relationship with the gamer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Growing Player, Creator and Viewer Base approaching critical mass that when coupled with highly customized gaming, creator and viewing experiences allows us to capture a global, highly engaged, yet somewhat elusive community that will provide many new ways to monetize over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creation of Intangible Brand Value in the quality of our offer, game titles, brand partners and investor base that validates our trusted, premium brand and distinctive positioning to drive value in the fragmented, burgeoning esports landscape.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Our Growth Strategy
  
 Our core strategy is to pursue initiatives that promote the viral growth of our audience, player and creator base, and in doing so, drive direct to consumer, advertising, and content revenue streams. Our customer acquisition and retention funnel provide the primary lens for community growth, engagement and long-term brand equity.

● | Audience and engagement growth driven organically through compelling proprietary and user-generated content supplemented by direct marketing, partner and influencer promotion, and search engine optimization overtime leveraging a network effect as we reach critical mass across our digital properties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Monetizable advertising inventory expansion in addition to increasing our direct sales force effectiveness, complemented with quality programmatic advertising, allowing us to both scale and gain a greater share of large advertisers’ marketing spend while preserving our premium CPM advertising model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Servable market expansion through new partnerships with game publishers and venues partners, along with the amplification from our brand and advertising partners, for access to new gamers domestically and internationally.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct to consumer revenue improvement through a further expansion of compelling, digital offerings and funnel optimization to convert more free-to-play gamers into paying consumers for greater revenue per user to drive up lifetime customer value while driving down customer acquisition cost.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform licensing exploration allowing media and retail partners to license our proprietary broadcast and esports venue-based technology, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunistic Acquisitions. We intend to pursue opportunistic acquisitions that will allow us to add complementary users, revenues, and/or technology components to accelerate our gaming-centric community and content platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Intellectual Property and Patents
   
 Similar to other interactive entertainment and esports companies, our business depends heavily on the creation, acquisition, licensing, use and protection of intellectual property. We have developed and own various intellectual properties, including pending and issued trademarks, patents, and copyrights.  For example, each of our City Clubs have pending trademarks related to naming and logo. We also have obtained licenses to valuable intellectual property with game publishers.  We leverage these licenses and service agreements to operate online and location-based competitions, and in parallel, use them to generate a wide array of content.
  
 To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent applications, published and issued patents,  copyrights, pending and issued trademarks, confidentiality provisions and procedures, other contractual provisions, trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure. We intend to vigorously protect our technology and proprietary rights; however, no assurances can be given that our efforts will be successful. Even if our efforts are successful, we may incur significant costs in defending our rights. From time to time, third parties may initiate litigation against us, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or claiming they have not infringed our intellectual property rights. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding the risks we face with respect to litigation related to intellectual property claims.  As of the date hereof, we have two pending patent applications and two issued patents, and various trademark applications, some granted and most of which are currently pending, covering our technologies and brands, as more specifically set forth below. We intend to file additional applications for the grant of patents and registration of our trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions as our business expands.
  
 Our issued patents relate to methods of visualization of gameplay across a wide array of game titles for the purpose of content creation and broadcasting. These visualizations manifest as web streams with related textual, graphical, and video content targeted for consumption by audiences across various streaming and VOD platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.  To achieve these visualizations, we leverage patent protected technology that places “camera” characters into certain games alongside the competing players, and use the perspective of the ‘camera’ character to provide unique views into the action.  We also have pending patent applications for certain bleeding edge virtualization methods that allow us to generate, at scale, many concurrent visualizations from the cloud.

  Our Values and Company Culture
  
 Super League is a gamer-first company, a credo embraced by every employee. We are committed to enhancing and celebrating the player and creator experience by providing gameplay experiences and viewing entertainment that promotes positive play that is inclusive, fair and fun.
  
 Having produced thousands of digital and physical experiences in addition to our always-on offers, Super League speaks to a wide range of demographic audiences that bring players and creators along with their families and friends together to celebrate their gameplay and entertainment content.
  
  Employees and Labor Relations
  
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 51 full-time and full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we occasionally enter into service agreements with independent contractors, on an as-needed basis, to perform certain services. As of December 31, 2020, four of our full-time employees were subject to fixed-term employment agreements with us, and all other employees served at-will pursuant to the terms set forth in their offer letters.
  
 We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any labor disputes. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.
  
  Governmental Regulation
  
 Our online gaming platforms, which target individuals ranging from elementary school age children to adults, are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection. Through our website, online platforms and in person gaming activities we may monitor and collect certain information about child users of these forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet, such as COPPA. COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions related to what information may be collected with respect to children under the age of 13, as the kinds of content that website operators may present to children under such age. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from individuals, particularly in relation to an individual’s personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). We employ a kick-out procedure during user registration whereby anyone identifying themselves as being under the age of 13 during the process is not allowed to register for a player account on our website or participate in any of our online experiences or tournaments without linking their account to that of a parent or guardian.
  
 In addition, as a part of our experiences, we offer prizes and/or gifts as incentives to play. The federal Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act and certain state prize, gift or sweepstakes statutes may apply to certain experiences we run from time to time, and other federal and state consumer protection laws applicable to online collection, use and dissemination of data, and the presentation of website or other electronic content, may require us to comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access.
