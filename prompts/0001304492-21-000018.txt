 Item 1. Business    Overview 
 Anterix Inc, (“Anterix,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a wireless communications company focused on commercializing our spectrum assets to enable our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers to deploy private broadband networks, technologies and solutions. We are the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz) with nationwide coverage throughout the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  On May 13, 2020, the FCC made a historic approval of the Report and Order to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to be utilized for the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions. The Report and Order was published in the Federal Register on July 16, 2020 and became effective on August 17, 2020. We are now engaged in qualifying for and securing broadband licenses from the FCC, with a focus on pursuing licenses in those counties in which we believe we have near-term commercial opportunities. At the same time, our sales and marketing organizations are actively pursuing opportunities to lease the broadband spectrum to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. 
 In December 2020, we entered into our first long-term 900 MHz broadband spectrum lease agreements (the “Lease Agreements”) covering Ameren Corporation’s (“Ameren”) service territories. The Lease Agreements will enable Ameren to deploy a private LTE network in each of its service territories in Missouri and Illinois covering approximately 7.5 million people. Each Lease Agreement is for a term of up to 40 years, consisting of an initial term of 30 years, with an option to extend for an additional 10-year term for an additional payment. The scheduled prepayments for the 30-year initial terms of the Lease Agreements total approximately $48 million dollars. Full prepayment for the 30-year initial terms is due by 2026, with approximately 50% of the total Lease Agreements due and payable subject to our ability to clear spectrum and secure the broadband licenses for the relevant counties. Our board of directors (the “Board”) approved the Lease Agreements on April 23, 2021, and Ameren’s board of directors approved the Lease Agreements on May 6, 2021. We are proactively clearing incumbents from the 900 MHz broadband segments in Ameren’s service territories and expect to begin delivering the broadband spectrum licenses by county during fiscal year 2022 upon the necessary license issuance and approval by the FCC. We submitted our first applications for broadband licenses on May 27, 2021.
 In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with SDG&E, to provide 900 MHz broadband spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory, including San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County (the “SDG&E Agreement”). The SDG&E Agreement will support SDG&E’s deployment of a private LTE network, with a population of approximately 3.6 million people. As part of the SDG&E Agreement, we and SDG&E intend to collaborate on accelerating utility industry momentum for private networks. The SDG&E Agreement includes the assignment of 6 MHz of broadband spectrum, 936.5 – 939.5 MHz paired with 897.5 – 900.5 MHz, within SDG&E’s service territory following the FCC’s issuance of broadband licenses to us. We expect to begin delivering broadband spectrum to SDG&E by county in fiscal year 2023 and to complete delivery by the end of fiscal 2024. We are working with incumbents to clear the 900 MHz broadband allocation in the SDG&E service territory. The total payment of $50.0 million is comprised of an initial payment of $20.0 million, which we received in February 2021. The remaining $30.0 million is due through fiscal 2024 as we deliver broadband spectrum to SDG&E.
 A Glossary of industry terms used in this Item 1 is provided at the end of this section.
 Our Historical Spectrum Assets
 Our spectrum is our most valuable asset. We are the largest holder of FCC-licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz), with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. In the 900 MHz band, the FCC historically allocated approximately 10 MHz of spectrum, sub-divided into 40 10-channel blocks (for a total of 399 contiguous channels) alternating between blocks designated for the operation of Specialized Mobile Radio (“SMR”) commercial systems and blocks designated for private land mobile systems for business users (“B/ILT”), with the FCC’s rules also enabling B/ILT licenses to be converted to SMR use. Subsequently, the FCC conducted overlay auctions on the SMR designated blocks that awarded geographic-based licenses on a Major Trading Area (“MTA”) basis while affording operational protection to incumbent, site-based licensees in those areas. Certain MTA licenses were not purchased at auction or have been returned to the FCC. In addition, the FCC never auctioned the 20 blocks of B/ILT spectrum and in some parts of the United States, no users acquired site-based licenses utilizing this spectrum. As a result, the FCC is currently holding 900 MHz spectrum in its inventory in most counties throughout the United States.
 We own licenses, on average, for approximately 60% of the 399 channels in the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan market areas in the United States, which covers approximately 70% of the U.S. population. We acquired our 900 MHz spectrum and certain related equipment from Sprint in September 2014 for $100 million, which we paid in the form of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock.
 Our Historical FCC Initiatives
 Joint Petition. While our current licensed spectrum can support narrowband and wideband wireless services, the most significant business opportunities we identified require contiguous spectrum that allows for greater bandwidth than allowed by the current configuration of the 900 MHz band. In November 2014, in conjunction with the Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”), we   Page 3

 
          submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking (the “Joint Petition”) to the FCC proposing a realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz band to create a 6 MHz broadband segment, while retaining 4 MHz for continued narrowband operations. The EWA is a trade association representing the spectrum interests of a broad range of business enterprise, critical infrastructure and commercial service providers. In response to the Joint Petition, the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested parties and asked several questions about the proposal. A number of parties, including several incumbent licensees, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views both in support and opposition. In May 2015, we and the EWA filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition recommending procedural and technical operating parameters and processes related to the administration and technical sequencing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band. Our proposed rules included the requirement for the broadband operator to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the costs of their realignment and to utilize available filtering technologies to protect incumbents adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band. 
 Notice of Inquiry. In August 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) announcing that it had commenced a proceeding to examine whether it would be in the public interest to change the existing rules governing the 900 MHz band to increase access to spectrum, improve spectrum efficiency and expand flexibility for a variety of potential uses and applications, including broadband and other advanced technologies and services. The FCC requested interested parties, including us, to comment on several questions related to three potential options for the 900 MHz band: (i) retaining the current configuration of the 900 MHz band, but increasing operational flexibility; (ii) reconfiguring a portion or all of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services; or (iii) retaining the current 900 MHz band licensing and eligibility rules. Because the FCC requested information on multiple options for the 900 MHz band, the NOI effectively superseded the Joint Petition and other pending proposals that involved the 900 MHz band. We and EWA filed a joint response to the FCC’s NOI in October 2017 and submitted reply comments in November 2017.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. On March 14, 2019, the FCC unanimously adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) endorsing our objective of creating a broadband opportunity in the 900 MHz band for critical infrastructure and other enterprise users. In the NPRM, the FCC requested comments aimed at gathering information to help the FCC balance the interests of a potential broadband applicant with the interests of incumbents and other interested parties. The FCC’s questions included: (i) what mechanism and requirements should be imposed before a broadband applicant can acquire the FCC’s inventory of spectrum, including how to mitigate a windfall that might be attributed to the broadband applicant by the FCC’s action; (ii) what mechanism should be used to enable the broadband applicant to clear sufficient spectrum to qualify for a broadband license, including how to prevent potential holdouts; (iii) what size systems being operated by incumbents should be deemed to be “Complex Systems” and exempt from any mandatory relocation requirements; and (v) what approaches, including potential overlay auctions, should be used in counties where the broadband segment cannot be cleared of incumbents.
 We filed our comments to the NPRM in June 2019 and submitted reply comments in July 2019. Following the comment period, we continued to meet with the FCC, incumbents holding licenses or operating systems in the 900 MHz band, utility and other critical infrastructure businesses, providers of equipment, technologies and/or services to the utility and other critical infrastructure businesses and other interested parties in the 900 MHz band. The goals of these discussions were to: (i) build consensus and solicit support for the proposed reconfiguration of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services; (ii) resolve technical and other concerns raised by incumbents; (iii) educate critical infrastructure and other enterprises on how broadband capabilities could enhance their operations and initiatives and their regulatory obligations; (iv) gain a better understanding of the size of the operational incumbent base and the nature of the systems they are currently operating; and (v) evaluate and propose voluntary license relocation opportunities to, or purchase spectrum from, certain incumbents.
 The 900 MHz Report and Order 
 On May 13, 2020, the FCC approved the Report and Order to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to be utilized for the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions. In the Report and Order, the FCC reconfigured the 900 MHz band to create a 6 MHz broadband segment (240 channels) and two narrowband segments, consisting of a 3 MHz narrowband segment (120 channels) and a 1 MHz narrowband segment (39 channels).  See FIGURE I below.

 The Role of the County.  Under the Report and Order, the FCC established the “county” as the base unit of measure in determining whether a broadband applicant is eligible to secure a broadband license. There are 3,233 counties in the United States, including Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.
 Broadband License Eligibility Requirements. The Report and Order establishes three eligibility requirements to obtain broadband licenses in a county, which we refer to herein as (i) the “50% Licensed Spectrum Test,” (ii) the “90% Broadband Segment Test” and (iii) the “240 Channel Requirement.”

1. 50% Licensed Spectrum Test. To be eligible for a broadband license in a particular county, a broadband applicant must demonstrate that it holds more than 50% of the outstanding licensed channels in that county. As noted above, the 900 MHz band is made up of a maximum of 399 channels in each county. The FCC has licensed less than the maximum number of 399 channels in all but the most populous counties. Because the 50% Licensed Spectrum Test is based on licensed channels, any channels that are not licensed by the FCC are not included in the denominator when determining whether the broadband applicant has satisfied this test. As of the date of this filing, we satisfy the 50% Licensed Spectrum Test in more than 3,100 counties of the 3,233 counties in the United States and its territories. See MAP 1 below.

2. 90% Broadband Segment Test. The second test, the 90% Broadband Segment Test, addresses the balance between a voluntary market process to clear any “Covered Incumbent” (i.e., holders of licenses in the broadband segment) and the mandatory relocation process established by the FCC in the Report and Order (which applies to all Covered Incumbents, except for those Covered Incumbents operating “Complex Systems” as defined below). This test requires the broadband applicant to hold or have agreements with Covered Incumbents for 90% of the licensed channels in the broadband segment in a particular county and within 70 miles of the county’s boundaries before the FCC will issue a broadband license or commence the mandatory retuning period. The broadband segment in the 900 MHz band has a total of 240 channels. The 90% Broadband Segment Test is calculated using outstanding licensed channels, which means that if the FCC has licensed all 240 channels, the broadband applicant would be required to have control of, or agreements covering, 216 channels within the broadband segment. In most counties in the United States, the FCC has licensed fewer than 240 channels in the broadband segment and these unlicensed channels are not included in the denominator when determining whether the broadband applicant has satisfied this 90% Broadband Segment Test. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A broadband applicant can satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test by purchasing channels from Covered Incumbents for cash or other consideration, by paying to relocate Covered Incumbents to replacement spectrum channels outside the broadband segment, or by demonstrating that the broadband applicant’s facilities will be far enough from the Covered Incumbent’s narrowband system to allow the two types of networks to co-exist.
 Before filing for a broadband license, the broadband applicant must satisfy the 90% Broadband Segment Test by utilizing its channel holdings and negotiating with Covered Incumbents on a purely voluntary basis for any additional channels it requires to satisfy this test. Only after the 90% Broadband Segment Test is satisfied will the FCC issue the broadband applicant a broadband license and commence the “Mandatory Retuning” period. During this Mandatory Retuning period, any Covered Incumbents that remain in the broadband segment (other than Complex Systems) are required to negotiate in good faith with the broadband applicant to sell their channels or otherwise clear the broadband segment, subject to intervention by the FCC if the parties cannot reach an agreement.

Total of 3,233 counties in the US and territories Map dated May 2020.
3. 240 Channel Requirement. The Report and Order requires the broadband applicant to surrender 6 MHz of narrowband spectrum (or 240 channels) in the applicable county to the FCC in exchange for a broadband license. If the broadband applicant does not have sufficient channels in the county to return 240 channels to the FCC, it can elect to make an Anti-Windfall Payment (see Glossary) to the U.S. Treasury to effectively purchase unlicensed channels in the FCC’s inventory. The Anti-Windfall Payment for these channels will be based on prices paid in the applicable county in the 600 MHz auction conducted by the FCC. To satisfy the 240 Channel Requirement, the broadband applicant has the option on a county-by-county basis to determine whether it is more cost-effective to make the Anti-Windfall Payment, purchase channels from incumbents (where available), or possibly a combination of both. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Importantly, the markets where the FCC has channels in inventory and where we may need to make Anti-Windfall Payments to effectively return 240 channels to the FCC are generally in smaller urban, suburban and rural markets. Our spectrum position is greatest in the largest, most populated and therefore most expensive markets, with a few exceptions as shown in MAP 3 below. Although we will need to make Anti-Windfall Payments to secure broadband licenses in some counties, the cost for the channels, on average, will be lower than the nationwide average amount of $0.93 per MHz of population covered, or POP, paid in the FCC’s 600 MHz auction.

 Treatment of Complex Systems. The Report and Order exempts Complex Systems from the Mandatory Retuning process—even when a broadband applicant meets the 90% Broadband Segment Test. The FCC defines a Complex System as a radio system that has at least 45 integrated sites. The FCC exempted Complex Systems from the mandatory retuning requirements because retuning these systems would potentially be disruptive to the operators. Of the small number of systems that qualify for this 45-site exemption, based on our calculation, all but one system belongs to utilities that we have identified as our target customers. See MAP 4 below.

 The Association of American Railroads. The nation’s railroads, particularly the major freight lines, operate on six narrowband 900 MHz channels licensed to their trade association, the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”). Three of these narrowband channels are located in the 900 MHz broadband segment created by the FCC. In January 2020, we entered into an agreement with the AAR in which we agreed to cancel licenses in the 900 MHz band to enable the AAR to relocate its operations, including operations utilizing the three channels located in the 900 MHz broadband segment (the “AAR Agreement”). The FCC referenced the AAR agreement in the Report and Order and required the Company to cancel its licenses and return them to the FCC in accordance with the AAR Agreement. We cancelled these licenses in June 2020. The Report and Order provides that the FCC will make the channels associated with these licenses available to the AAR to enable the AAR to relocate their current operations. The Report and Order also provides that the FCC will credit us for our cancelled licenses for purposes of determining our eligibility to secure broadband licenses and the calculation of any Anti-Windfall Payments.
 Costs of Securing Broadband Licenses
 As discussed above, to obtain a broadband license in a county, the broadband applicant must satisfy (i) the 50% Licensed Spectrum Test, (ii) the 90% Broadband Segment Test and (iii) the 240 Channel Requirement. As the broadband applicant, we can satisfy these channel requirements by including our existing licensed channels in the 900 MHz band and by acquiring or clearing additional channels when necessary through (i) spectrum purchases, (ii) retuning incumbents and/or (iii) effectively obtaining channels by making Anti-Windfall Payments. Under the Report and Order, we have the option of using each of these options alone, or in any combination required, to satisfy the broadband license eligibility requirements for a particular county. See FIGURE II.

 1.Channel Acquisition. In 2015, we began acquiring targeted additional channels in the 900 MHz band in various markets in anticipation of the Report and Order. We have and will continue to employ spectrum acquisition as a tool for those situations where a Covered Incumbent desires to exit the 900 MHz band. We may selectively acquire channels outside the 900 MHz broadband segment and use them to swap for channels within the broadband segment. For purposes of our broadband license eligibility, any potential acquisitions we negotiate in the 900 MHz band may be included as part of our broadband application, but the acquisition does not need to be consummated at the time we submit our broadband license application.
 2.Retuning Costs. Retuning is the exercise of exchanging, also referred to as swapping, broadband segment channels held by Covered Incumbents and moving them to channels outside of the 900 MHz broadband segment. A retune or swap adds to the number of channels we hold for computational purposes of the 90% Broadband Segment Test. We began retuning or swapping channels with interested Covered Incumbents in 2015 in anticipation of the Report and Order. We have continued retuning channels with Covered Incumbents since that time. For purposes of broadband license eligibility, any potential spectrum retuning agreements we negotiate in 900 MHz will be included as part of our broadband application, but we are not required to complete the retune or swap before we submit our Broadband license application.
 3.Anti-Windfall Payments. To obtain a 6 MHz broadband license, we must surrender 240 licensed channels in the county. As this band has been underutilized historically, most counties in the United States do not have 240 outstanding licensed channels. To make up the difference, we may obtain channels from the FCC’s spectrum inventory and effectively pay for those channels by making an Anti-Windfall Payment. As noted above, the FCC will use a reference per channel price based on the average price paid in the FCC’s 600 MHz auction in a given county.
 Broadband Licensing Process 
 In May 2021, the Wireless Telecommunication Bureau released a Public Notice detailing the application requirements and timeline for obtaining broadband licenses. The broadband licensing process includes an FCC Form 601, an application used for new wireless licenses, an Eligibility Certification and a Transition Plan describing the agreements the prospective broadband applicant has entered into with Covered Incumbents. We intend to pursue and file applications based on the timing of customer opportunities and our spectrum clearing results. Within 15 days of filing an application, we will make an Anti-Windfall Payment to the U.S. Treasury for any spectrum we require from the FCC’s inventory to reach the 240 Channel Requirement. In cases where we have satisfied the 90% Broadband Segment Test but have not reached an agreement with all Covered Incumbents, the Mandatory Retuning process will commence after we receive the broadband license. Our Business Strategy
 Our mission is to deliver the transformative broadband needed to enable the modernization of utilities and other critical infrastructure sectors through the power of private wireless broadband connectivity on 900 MHz spectrum. To that end, we are pursuing a two-pronged strategy focused on: 1) converting our nationwide narrowband 900 MHz spectrum position into valuable broadband spectrum and 2) establishing our commercial positioning and accelerating adoption of our principal commercial business offering, the long-term leasing of our broadband spectrum, by utility and critical infrastructure enterprises nationwide. Our approach and supporting business initiatives are captured below:
 Converting our Nationwide Narrowband 900 MHz Spectrum Position to Broadband. Converting our spectrum from narrowband to broadband application nationwide is a foundational component of our two-pronged strategy as it provides the platform for growing our business. To achieve this conversion, we are focused on intentionally clearing incumbents out of the broadband license segment and obtaining broadband licenses in those counties in which we have customer contracts, believe we have near-term commercial prospects, or may be strategically advantageous to achieve optimum cost and broadband licenses over time.


  Page 10

 
          Secure Broadband Licenses. In the Report and Order, the FCC chose to make counties the “base unit of measure” for calculating whether an entity is eligible to hold a broadband license. As a result of this decision and our extensive accumulated spectrum holdings, Anterix—and only Anterix—is an essential party in every one of the nation’s 3,233 counties. And while we intend to continue to prioritize our spectrum transactions in areas where we have customer opportunities, we also plan to pursue spectrum transactions opportunistically to recognize a positive return on our investments in spectrum clearing costs. We have been proactive in this effort and to date have completed, and intend to continue to pursue, spectrum transactions to support our efforts to satisfy the broadband license eligibility requirements.
 Retune Covered Incumbents.  In anticipation of the efforts required to secure broadband licenses, we have been proactive in our retuning efforts in preparation for the broadband licensing process. “Retuning” is the exercise of exchanging, or swapping, broadband segment channels of Covered Incumbents and moving them to channels outside of the broadband segment. Our dedicated retuning teams are focused on moving Covered Incumbents from the newly allocated broadband segment of the 900 MHz spectrum band to the segments allocated for continued narrowband operations or out of 900 MHz band entirely. Our team has already established contact with nearly all of the Covered Incumbents throughout the country.
 Deploying our Commercial Business Offering.  With the Report and Order now issued, paving the way for the deployment of broadband in the 900 MHz band, the second key prong of our strategy is accelerating the adoption of our 900 MHz driven private LTE (“PTLE”) solution. We are implementing this strategy through targeted deployment of our principal commercial business offering by our sales and marketing organization, participating in the Utilities Broadband Alliance (“UBBA”) and attracting vendors to the Anterix Active Ecosystem. We recently launched the Anterix Active Ecosystem to provide technical and marketing support to a broad ecosystem of technology innovators and to help them bring value to utilities and critical infrastructure companies deploying and operating 900 MHz PLTE networks. Based upon our analysis and discussions with potential customers to date, we generally intend to lease the broadband licenses we secure to customers for long lease terms (generally 20 years or longer), including long-term renewal options. In that vein, we will be responsible for the costs of securing the broadband licenses from the FCC, including the costs of acquiring sufficient spectrum to support broadband use and retuning incumbents to clear the spectrum.
 By contrast, we expect that our customers will bear the costs of deploying and operating their private broadband networks, technologies and solutions. And, beyond our principal commercial business offering, we are also exploring opportunities to offer our prospective customers additional non-capital intensive, value-added services to support their network deployment and operation.
 Accordingly, our approach to driving this second key prong of our strategy includes: 1) growing our customer pipeline; 2) assisting customers as they move through the evaluation process of private wireless networks; 3) encouraging federal and state agencies to support the deployment of private LTE solutions in the 900 MHz band by utilities and critical infrastructure companies; 4) participating in demonstrations and tests with national laboratories such as National Renewable Energy Lab (“NREL”) and National Institute of Standards and Technology; 5) developing expanded value-added business offerings; 6) enabling and growing the Anterix Active Ecosystem; 7)  participating in UBBA to promote our solution; and 8) continually evaluating potential opportunities to expand the application of private wireless broadband networks built on 900 MHz.
 Continue to Build the Customer Pipeline. Our business development and sales teams are actively working with many of the largest Investor Owned Utilities. More specifically, these teams are working in coordination with representatives from our target customers, LTE infrastructure vendors, end-user device manufacturers and other technology companies in addition to responding to Requests for Information (“RFIs”), Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”) and requests to support technology trials related to using our 900 MHz spectrum for broadband services.
 Build Support with Federal and State Agencies. Our targeted critical infrastructure customers are highly regulated by both federal and state agencies. Electrical utilities, for example, are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Public Utilities Commissions within the states they serve.  Other agencies that guide utility regulations include the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. We are working with each of these agencies to educate them about the security, reliability and priority access benefits that private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions can offer utilities. We are also working with a number of state agencies and commissions who regulate electrical utilities, and who have a strong influence over electric utility buying decisions. Our goal with these state agencies and commissions is to gain their support, with an eye toward allowing utilities to include the costs of leasing of our spectrum assets and deploying private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions into their respective rate bases. Utility control of communications for grid modernization programs enhances their ability to provide safe, reliable, resilient and cost effective electricity for the ratepayers.  If included in rate bases, this permits utilities to recover that investment through rates and earn a customary rate of return on those prudent investments.
 Develop a Roadmap for Expanded Services. Through our day-to-day interactions with prospective utility and critical infrastructure customers, and our responses and subsequent discussions related to RFIs and RFPs, we have identified additional areas of opportunity to support our prospective customers in the implementation of  PLTE networks. We are performing due diligence to determine how best to meet these customer needs, including using our internal expertise, collaborating with strategic partners and working with specific service providers. 
 Enable the Anterix Active Ecosystem with U.S. Band 8. Our spectrum assets are located in the international 3GPP global standard Band 8 channel which is a frequency duplex (“FDD”) pair assigned to the 880 - 915 / 925 - 960 MHz spectrum bands. This 

  Page 11

 
          pairing is aligned for use with both 4G and 5G technologies and is currently being utilized with commercial LTE and 5G broadband networks globally in Asia, Europe, and other parts of the world. Our efforts are ongoing to facilitate continued adoption of 900 MHz Band 8 radio access network (“RAN”) equipment and end-user devices in the U.S. by working with chipmakers and module and device vendors to help ensure that customers who employ 900MHz for PLTE have timely access to 3GPP standards-compliant Band 8 devices that meet the technical operating specifications established in the FCC’s Report and Order. We also developed the testing protocols to enable us to test and certify Band 8 devices for use in the 900 MHz band. The benefit of working with a global standard is that it supports the availability of many existing devices, network components, and solutions that are well suited for the working environment of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.
 Identify and Evaluate New Opportunities for Our Spectrum. The wireless communications industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid regulatory, technological and market changes. A key part of our business strategy is to continually monitor changes in the wireless industry and to evaluate how these changes could enable us to maximize the value of our spectrum assets. Additionally, although we are initially focusing on the electric utility industry, we have identified other customer groups, including ports, railroads, water, oil and gas facilities, and mining operations, where we believe there is both customer demand and a good fit for the private wireless broadband networks, technologies, and solutions that our spectrum assets could support.
 Our Broadband Market Opportunity
 We have identified utility and critical infrastructure enterprises as the primary customers for our future broadband spectrum assets. We have identified the electric utility industry as our initial focused customer group. We believe that security, priority access, latency, redundancy, private ownership and control and unique coverage requirements are just some of the reasons utility and critical infrastructure enterprises would be interested in obtaining rights to deploy the private wireless broadband networks, technologies and solutions that can be enabled through use of our spectrum.
 The electric utility industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Grid modernization efforts and the drive to reduce carbon emissions have hindered the ability of utilities to build new large-scale, centralized facilities. Today, power is generated by smaller, more geographically distributed facilities that can switch from a power producer to a recipient of power generated by a variety of other disparate sources, including wind and solar installations. Grid architecture must now accommodate end-users that are both generators and consumers, converting back and forth rapidly and carrying power in both directions, something the existing grid was not originally designed to handle. Technological advancements have produced sensors and smart devices to enable the new two-way grid and offer operators the ability to control and run the grid efficiently, safely and reliably. Utilities, however, need wireless communication networks, technologies and solutions that can move the large volumes of data generated by these sensors and smart devices to their control systems for decision making, analytics, responsiveness to market demand and emergencies. The legacy communications systems utilized by many utilities cannot handle this new data load, have increasing interference and/or higher cyber threats, are inefficient and costly to maintain, and, in many cases, have associated equipment that is approaching end of life.
 Our targeted customers have historically built, maintained and operated their communication networks, including private Land Mobile Radio (“LMR”) networks and supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) networks on narrowband frequencies licensed exclusively to them by the FCC. Based on our discussions with these targeted customers, these entities commonly express their desire to retain the positive elements of their aging LMR and SCADA networks, namely private ownership, tight control and custom features (such as specialized coverage and priority access), while adding the benefits of broadband and other advanced technologies (such as solving a broader set of use cases, including high-speed data transmission, video services and economies of scale). However, due to the general unavailability of low band spectrum (i.e., below 1 GHz), these entities have had limited opportunities to license or acquire the spectrum required to deploy cost-effective wireless broadband or other advanced technologies on their own.
 In contrast to legacy systems, the wireless broadband networks, technologies and solutions that can be utilized with our spectrum assets can address the communication demands of the modern grid, both now and in the future. Our licensed 900 MHz spectrum offers the assurance of absolute control over access to and use of that spectrum, allowing our spectrum to be utilized to provide customers with guaranteed levels of service and the ability to prescribe and enforce purpose-built “rules of the road” for the provision of those services. Our spectrum assets can also serve as the foundational element to allow our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to add 5G capabilities or move from LTE to 5G. Recent FCC decisions have created significant opportunities for blocks of shared, unlicensed spectrum, both below 1 GHz to a limited extent and, in substantial amounts, above 1 GHz. The addition of unlicensed spectrum, particularly in large swaths that support very high-speed services, can enable future 5G networks, technologies and solutions. While we intend to build our existing and future business strategies around our 900 MHz licensed spectrum, the ability of our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to combine our licensed 900 MHz spectrum with additional spectrum in one or more unlicensed bands can provide them with an advantageous solution, and a path to 5G.
 Business Development, Sales and Marketing
 We have invested in building our business development, sales and marketing teams, which include both external and internal resources, to help foster our evolving customer relationships in furtherance of sustaining and growing our pipeline. Since the FCC’s issuance of the Report and Order, our sales and marketing efforts have been focused on pursuing spectrum lease arrangements with our targeted utility and critical infrastructure customers. We intend to enter long-term (e.g., 20 years, plus renewals) leasing   Page 12

 
          arrangements with these customers. We expect our customers will bear the costs of deploying and operating their private broadband networks operating on the broadband spectrum we lease to them.
 Our business development, sales and marketing organization has the following three key focus areas:  (i) direct account-based sales and marketing efforts to our targeted customers; (ii) regulatory outreach and support; and (iii) industry trade organization collaboration. We intend to enhance these efforts with sales and marketing partnerships with a variety of third parties, such as integrators and technology and equipment vendors, with whom we will seek active promotion of our broadband spectrum assets and  support for our broadband spectrum assets with their products, technologies, solutions and services. Additionally, our marketing team supports our sales efforts through participation, sponsorships and speaking engagements at major trade events, associations and organizations.
 In December 2020, we achieved a significant milestone by entering into the Lease Agreements, our first long-term 900 MHz broadband spectrum lease agreements covering Ameren’s service territories. The Lease Agreements will enable Ameren to deploy a PLTE network in its service territories in Missouri and Illinois covering approximately 7.5 million people. Each Lease Agreement is for a term of up to 40 years, consisting of an initial term of 30 years, with an option to extend for an additional 10-year term for an additional payment. The scheduled prepayments for the 30-year initial terms of the Lease Agreements total approximately $48 million. Full prepayment for the 30-year initial terms is due by 2026, with approximately 50% of the total prepayments due and payable subject to our ability to clear spectrum and secure the broadband licenses for the relevant counties. Our Board approved the Lease Agreements on April 23, 2021, and Ameren’s board of directors approved the Lease Agreements on May 6, 2021. We are proactively clearing incumbents from the 900 MHz broadband segments in Ameren’s service territories and expect to begin delivering the broadband spectrum licenses by county during fiscal year 2022 upon the issuance of broadband licenses and relevant approvals needed from the FCC. We submitted our first applications for broadband licenses on May 27, 2021.
 In February 2021, we entered into the SDG&E Agreement with SDG&E, to provide 900 MHz broadband spectrum throughout SDG&E’s California service territory, including San Diego and Imperial Counties and portions of Orange County. The SDG&E Agreement will support SDG&E’s deployment of a PLTE network for its California service territory, with a population of approximately 3.6 million people. As part of the SDG&E Agreement, we and SDG&E intend to collaborate on accelerating utility industry momentum for private networks. The SDG&E Agreement includes the assignment of 6 MHz of broadband spectrum, 936.5 – 939.5 MHz paired with 897.5 – 900.5 MHz, within SDG&E’s service territory following the FCC’s issuance of broadband licenses to us. We expect to begin delivering broadband spectrum to SDG&E by county in fiscal year 2023 and to complete delivery by the end of fiscal year 2024. We are proactively working with incumbents to clear the 900 MHz broadband allocation in the SDG&E service territory. Total payment of $50.0 million is comprised of an initial payment of $20.0 million, which we received in February 2021. The remaining $30.0 million is due through fiscal year 2024 as we deliver broadband spectrum to SDG&E.

In addition to Ameren and SDG&E, the FCC has granted nine additional experimental licenses, which include licenses with seven individual utilities, the United Parcel Service and NREL.
 Competition
 Our competitors include the Tier 1 carriers (Verizon, AT&T and Sprint), private radio operators and other public and private companies who own spectrum, supply communication networks, technologies, products and solutions to our targeted utility and critical infrastructure enterprises. Many of these competitors have a long track record of providing technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers and have greater political and regulatory influence than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have more resources, substantially greater product development and marketing budgets, greater name and brand recognition, a significantly greater base of customers in which to spread their operating costs and more financial and personnel resources than we do. All of these factors could prevent, delay or increase the costs of commercializing the broadband licenses we secure to our targeted customers.
 In addition, these and other competitors have developed or may develop services, technologies, products and solutions that directly compete with the broadband networks, technologies, products and solutions that can be deployed with our spectrum assets. If competitors offer services, technologies, products and solutions to our targeted customers at prices and terms that make the licensing of our spectrum assets unattractive, we may be unable to attract customers at prices or on terms that would be favorable, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and prospects.
 Further, the FCC and other federal, state and local governmental authorities could adopt new regulations or take actions, including making additional spectrum available that can be utilized by our targeted customers, which could harm our ability to license our spectrum assets. For example, the federal government created and funded the First Responder Network Authority, which the federal government authorized to help accomplish, fund, and oversee the deployment of a dedicated Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (“NPSBN”), which is marketed as “FirstNet.” The NPSBN may provide an additional source of competition to utilizing our 900 MHz spectrum assets by our targeted utility and critical infrastructure enterprises.

 Transfer of Historical Businesses 
 Historically, we generated our revenue principally from our pdvConnect and TeamConnect businesses. pdvConnect is a mobile communication and workforce management solution that enables businesses to locate and communicate with their field workers and improve the documentation of work events and job status. We historically marketed pdvConnect primarily through two Tier 1 carriers in the United States. In the year ended March 31, 2016, we began offering a commercial push-to-talk (“PTT”) service, which we marketed as TeamConnect, in seven major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia. We developed TeamConnect to address the needs of enterprises that value a tailored PTT solution addressing the management of their mobile workforce. We primarily offered our TeamConnect service to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives who were primarily selected from Motorola’s nationwide dealer network.
 In June 2018, we announced our plan to restructure the business to align and focus our business priorities on the spectrum initiatives aimed at modernizing and realigning the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity, including for the future deployment of broadband and other advanced technologies and services. In December 2018, our Board approved the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses to help reduce our operating costs and to allow our management team and Company to focus on our FCC initiatives and future broadband opportunities. Specifically, we entered into: (i) a Customer Acquisition and Resale Agreement with A BEEP LLC (“A BEEP”) on January 2, 2019, (ii) a Customer Acquisition, Resale and Licensing Agreement with Goosetown Enterprises, Inc. (“Goosetown”) on January 2, 2019 and (iii) a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the principals of Goosetown on December 31, 2018.
 Under the A BEEP and Goosetown agreements, we: (i) transferred our TeamConnect customers located in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix metropolitan markets to A BEEP, (ii) transferred our TeamConnect customers located in the Baltimore/Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York metropolitan markets to Goosetown, (iii) provided A BEEP and Goosetown with access to our TeamConnect Metro and Campus Systems (the “MotoTRBO Systems”) and (iv) granted A BEEP and Goosetown the right to resell access to our MotoTRBO Systems pursuant to separate Mobile Virtual Network Operation arrangements for two years. We also granted Goosetown a license to sell the business applications we developed for our TeamConnect service.
 Under these agreements, A BEEP and Goosetown agreed to provide customer care, billing and collection services for their respective acquired customers. We continued to provide these services through April 1, 2019, to help facilitate the transition of the acquired customers. Additionally, we are required to maintain and pay all site lease, backhaul and utility costs required to operate the MotoTRBO Systems for two years ending on January 2, 2021. As part of our efforts to clear the 900 MHz spectrum for broadband use, A BEEP and Goosetown are required to migrate the acquired customers off the MotoTRBO Systems by the end of this two year period. In consideration for the customers and rights we transferred, A BEEP and Goosetown are required to pay us a certain portion of the recurring revenues they receive from the acquired customers ranging from 20-100% during the terms of the agreements. Additionally, A BEEP is required to pay us a portion of recurring revenue from customers who utilize A BEEP’s push-to-talk Diga-Talk Plus application service ranging from 15-35% for a period of two years. Goosetown is required to pay us 20% of recurring revenues from the TeamConnect applications we licensed to them for a period of two years. As part of our obligations, we will continue operating the TeamConnect networks in the markets in which customers are being transferred and trunked facilities in other markets in which we hold FCC licenses.
 Under the terms of the MOU, we assigned the intellectual property rights to our TeamConnect and pdvConnect applications to TeamConnect LLC (the “LLC”), a new entity formed by the principals of Goosetown, in exchange for a 19.5% ownership interest in the LLC upon the April 30, 2019 execution of the LLC’s Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. The Goosetown principals agreed to fund the future operations of the LLC, subject to certain limitations. The LLC assumed our software support and maintenance obligations under the A BEEP and Goosetown agreements. The LLC also assumed customer care services related to our pdvConnect application. On April 1, 2020, we transferred our pdvConnect customers to the LLC and the LLC agreed to pay us a certain portion of the recurring revenues from these customers.

On April 1, 2020, we entered into Amendment 2 (“Amendment 2”) to the IP Assignment, Software Support, and Development Services Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2019, as previously amended, by and between us and the LLC. Under Amendment 2, we transferred our pdvConnect customers to the LLC except for one Tier 1 domestic carrier. In exchange for the customer transfer, the LLC agreed to pay us a certain portion of the recurring revenues from these customers.

          Our Motorola Lease    In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Motorola to lease a portion of our 900 MHz licenses in exchange for an upfront, fully paid lease fee of $7.5 million. Additionally, Motorola invested $10 million in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC, that we formed to hold our 900 MHz spectrum licenses. Motorola’s ownership interest in our subsidiary is convertible, at the option of either party, into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. Motorola is not entitled to any profits, dividends, or other distribution from the operations of our subsidiary. Under the terms of this lease agreement with Motorola, Motorola can use the leased channels to provide narrowband services to certain qualified end-users. The end-users can only use the leased channels for their internal communication purposes. The end-users cannot sublease the channels to any other end-users or any commercial radio system operations or carriers. The lease agreement limits the total number of channels that Motorola can lease in any market area. The lease agreement provides us with flexibility regarding the future use and management of our spectrum, including relocation and repurposing policies designed to facilitate any necessary realignment of frequencies that may be associated with our efforts to clear spectrum for broadband uses.
 Motorola cannot enter contracts with end-users after December 31, 2020, involving new leases of spectrum from us without our consent and the payment of an additional fee. The initial lease period for any end-user cannot last more than seven years, and the lease can only be renewed for up to three years for an aggregate lease period of up to ten years.
 Our Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts, to protect our intellectual property. We have several trademarks and service marks to protect our current and future corporate name, services offerings, goodwill and brand. There are currently no claims or litigation regarding these trademarks, patents, copyrights, or service marks. We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants when appropriate. Regulation of Our Business
 We hold FCC spectrum licenses in the 900 MHz band throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. The FCC regulates our wireless spectrum holdings, the issuance of broadband licenses in the 900 MHz band in accordance with the Report and Order, our future leasing or sale of any broadband licenses we secure, and the future construction and operation of wireless networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our spectrum assets.
 Licensing.  We are authorized to provide our wireless communication services on specified frequencies within specified geographic areas and in doing so must comply with the rules, regulations and policies adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each spectrum license for a fixed period, typically ten years in the case of the FCC licenses we currently hold and 15 years for any broadband licenses in accordance with the Report and Order. Any broadband licenses we secure will also have performance requirements at the six- and 12-year marks to demonstrate that the broadband spectrum is being used to serve the public interest. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses held by operating companies like us, the FCC has the authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if it determines that license renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance is unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
 The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC rules and regulations require us to obtain the FCC’s prior approval before assigning or transferring control of wireless licenses, with limited exceptions. The FCC’s rules and regulations also govern spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses, including the licenses we hold. These same requirements apply to any licenses or leases we may wish to enter into, transfer, or acquire as part of our broadband initiatives. The FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on any proposed acquisitions, sales, or other transfers of control of licenses or leases. The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation or sale of spectrum licenses or leases and may apply a spectrum “screen” in examining such transactions. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide the wireless services we plan to enable, if the FCC were to disapprove any such request to acquire, assign, or otherwise transfer a license or lease, our business plans would be adversely affected. Approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state or local regulatory authorities, also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum.
 FCC Regulations.  The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by wireless providers. However, we may be subject to other FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as Federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings that may affect spectrum aggregation limits and/or adjustment of the FCC’s case-by-case spectrum screens; regulation surrounding the deployment of advanced wireless broadband infrastructure; the imposition of text-to-911 capabilities; and the transition to IP networks, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the previous examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational 

  Page 15

 
          challenges which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. We are unable to predict how these pending or future FCC proceedings may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable FCC regulations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures.
 State and Local Regulation.  In addition to FCC regulation, we are subject to certain state regulatory requirements. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any wireless provider. State and local governments, however, are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from wireless providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government. The siting of base stations also remains subject to some degree of control by state and local jurisdiction. States also may impose competitively neutral requirements that, among other things, are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state E911 services programs, to protect the public safety and welfare and to safeguard the rights of customers.
 Tower Siting.  Our future customers who deploy broadband networks will be required to comply with various federal, state and local regulations that govern the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas, including requirements imposed by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). Federal rules subject certain tower site locations to extensive zoning, environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties, including State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy facilities. The FCC antenna structure registration process also imposes public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of, or modification to, antenna structures that require FAA approval, potentially adding to the delays and burdens associated with tower siting, including potential challenges from special interest groups. To the extent governmental agencies continue to impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process, the time and cost to construct towers could be negatively impacted. The FCC has, however, imposed a tower siting “shot clock” that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe, which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers. More recently, the FCC also has adopted rules intended to accelerate broadband deployment by removing barriers to infrastructure investment, in particular for “small cell” equipment. Those rules have been challenged by certain municipalities and tribal nations both at the FCC and in court.
 Electronic Surveillance. Our clients who deploy broadband networks may be required by law to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies. If required, we intend to deliver the requisite surveillance capabilities to law enforcement with respect to any networks we deploy.
 National Security.  With a range of weather-related and cyber security impacts on the nation’s grid over the last several years, national security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal, state and local levels.  For example, Congress is expected to again consider cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation’s digital infrastructure. Our future customers who deploy broadband networks may be required to comply with potential federal, state and local regulations that govern elements of the electric grid.
 Report and Order.  The FCC regulates the issuance of broadband licenses in the 900 MHz band in accordance with the Report and Order. The Report and Order provides that the FCC will evaluate the success of the broadband realignment process in the 900 MHz band in 2021 and will consider whether it should adopt additional mechanisms to facilitate broadband deployment.
