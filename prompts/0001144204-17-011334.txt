Overview
 
Novavax, Inc., together with our wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines and adjuvants. Using innovative proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, we produce vaccine candidates to efficiently and effectively respond to both known and emerging disease threats.
 
We were incorporated in 1987 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20878, and our telephone number is (240) 268-2000. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “NVAX.”
 
Our vaccine candidates are genetically engineered three-dimensional nanostructures that incorporate recombinant proteins critical to disease pathogenesis. Our product pipeline targets a variety of infectious diseases, with clinical vaccine candidates for respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”) and Ebola virus (“EBOV”), and preclinical programs for Zika virus (“ZIKV”), seasonal influenza and a combination respiratory vaccine candidate, as well as other infectious disease vaccine candidates.
 
We are also developing immune stimulating saponin-based adjuvants through Novavax AB. Our lead adjuvant, Matrix-M™, has been shown to enhance immune responses and was well-tolerated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our pandemic H7N9 influenza vaccine candidate, as well as in a Phase 1 clinical trial for our EBOV vaccine candidate. Genocea Biosciences, Inc. has licensed rights to our Matrix technology and has conducted Phase 2 clinical trials with its herpes simplex 2 vaccine candidate using Matrix-M.
 
Product Pipeline
 
Our product pipeline includes vaccine candidates engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses with the potential to provide increased protection. Our nanoparticle technology targets antigens with conserved epitopes essential for viral function. Unlike traditional vaccines that ‘mimic’ viruses and elicit naturally occurring immune responses to them, our nanoparticles are engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses, which may be more efficacious than naturally-occurring immunity. Our vaccine technology has the potential to be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseases.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
 
We are developing our respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (“RSV F Vaccine”) for three susceptible target populations: infants via maternal immunization, older adults (60 years of age and older) and children six months to five years of age (“pediatrics”). We believe our RSV F Vaccine represents a multi-billion dollar revenue opportunity, worldwide. Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available.
 
Repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV are common and we currently estimate the global cost burden of RSV to be in excess of $88 billion.1 Despite decades of effort to develop an RSV vaccine, there are currently no licensed vaccines. Although the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis®) is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk of RSV disease, it is not indicated for use in other populations. We made a breakthrough in developing a vaccine that targets the fusion protein, or F-protein, of the virus. The F-protein has highly conserved amino acid sequences, called antigenic sites, which we believe are ideal vaccine targets. Palivizumab, which targets one such site, antigenic site II, has demonstrated protection in five randomized clinical trials. We genetically engineered a novel F-protein antigen resulting in enhanced immunogenicity by exposing these antigenic sites. The RSV F Vaccine assembles into a recombinant protein nanoparticle optimized for F-protein antigen presentation. We are seeking to bring the first RSV vaccine to market to combat the 64 million RSV infections that occur globally each year.2,3
 
RSV Infants via Maternal Immunization Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide.4,5 In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants, and globally, is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age.6,7 Despite the induction of post-infection immunity, repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV is common.8,9
 
Clinical Trial Update
 
Prepare Phase 3 Trial (Ongoing)
 
We initiated Prepare™, a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine, using aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant, in 5,000 to 8,255 healthy pregnant women in December 2015. The primary objective of the Prepare trial is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F Vaccine against symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection with hypoxemia in infants through a minimum of the first 90 days of life. The Prepare trial utilizes a group sequential design and is expected to take between three and four years to complete. We are currently in discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“FDA”) about conducting an informational analysis of the Prepare trial in late 2017. These discussions lead us to believe we will be allowed to conduct an informational analysis that would provide an indication of the vaccine’s potential efficacy against the primary endpoint.
 
The Prepare trial is supported by a grant (the “Grant”) of up to $89.1 million from BMGF. The Grant supports development activities, product licensing efforts and World Health Organization (“WHO”) prequalification of our RSV F Vaccine. In 2015, along with the Grant agreement (the “Grant Agreement”), we concurrently entered into a Global Access Commitments Agreement with BMGF, under which we agreed to make the RSV F Vaccine available and accessible at affordable pricing to people in certain low and middle income countries.

Phase 2 Safety and Immunogenicity Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 50 healthy pregnant women and their infants. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine in pregnant women in their third trimester, and assessed the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine. The trial also examined the impact of maternal immunization on infant safety during the first year of life and RSV-specific antibody levels through the infants’ first six months of life. Immunized women demonstrated a geometric mean 14-fold rise in anti-F IgG, 29-fold rise in palivizumab-competing antibodies and a 2.7 and 2.1-fold rise in microneutralization titers against RSV/A and RSV/B, respectively. In contrast, women who received placebo demonstrated no significant change in antibody levels. The infants’ antibody levels at delivery averaged 90-100% of the mothers’ levels, indicating efficient transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to infant. The estimated half-lives of infant PCA, anti-F IgG, RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralizing antibodies, based on data through day 60, were 41, 30, 36 and 34 days, respectively.
Fast Track Designation
 
The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to our RSV F Vaccine for protection of infants via maternal immunization. Fast Track designation is intended for products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. The program is designed to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously.
RSV Older Adults Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
Adults 60 years of age and older are at increased risk for RSV disease due to immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the human immune system. In this population, RSV is an important respiratory virus, distinct from influenza, that is frequently responsible for serious lower respiratory tract disease and may lead to hospitalization or even death. Additionally, RSV infection can lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and congestive heart failure. In the U.S., the incidence rate is approximately 2.5 million infections per year, and RSV is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of 64 million older adults.10,11 Based on our analysis of published literature applied to 2014 U.S. population estimates, the disease causes 207,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths among adults older than 65.12,13 Annually, we estimate that there are approximately 900,000 medical interventions directly caused by RSV disease across all populations.14,15

Clinical Trial Update
 
Phase 2 Safety and Immunogenicity Trial (Ongoing)
 
In January 2017, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of the RSV F Vaccine in older adults. The objective of this Phase 2 trial is to assess safety and immunogenicity to one and two dose regimens of the RSV F Vaccine, with and without aluminum phosphate or Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, in older adults. The trial is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial which has enrolled 300 older adults in the Southern Hemisphere. Participants were enrolled and vaccinated outside of the RSV season to best assess immunogenicity, with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2017.
Resolve Phase 3 Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2016, we announced top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults, known as Resolve™. Resolve was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that began in November 2015, and was fully enrolled with 11,856 older adult subjects at 60 sites in the U.S. by December 2015. Historically, annual seasonal attack rates for all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (“RSV ARD”) of between 3% and 7% have been observed in older adults.16
 
In our Phase 2 trial conducted during the 2014-2015 RSV season, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 4.9%, with an attack rate of 1.8% for moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (“RSV msLRTD”), which aligns with peer-reviewed literature.17 In the Resolve trial, in contrast, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 2.0% and an RSV msLRTD attack rate of 0.4%. These unexpectedly low attack rates indicated a mild 2015-2016 RSV season in older adults. The trial did not meet the pre-specified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy. The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of RSV msLRTD, as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV ARD. The trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo and consistent with our previous clinical experience, the vaccine was well-tolerated. We continue to analyze data from the Resolve trial in order to better understand these results and to map a path forward for this important program. Our efforts include analyses of existing immunogenicity and efficacy data, and application of new assays to archived samples. We have also undertaken external epidemiology studies to further understand the attack rate, healthcare burden and seasonality of RSV disease in older adults. We expect these analyses to provide important information and context when we review the results from the Phase 2 clinical trial in older adults that we initiated in January 2017 and evaluate our next steps.
 
Phase 2 Rollover Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2016, we also announced positive top-line data from the Phase 2 rollover clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled rollover trial which enrolled 1,329 older adults from the prior Phase 2 trial, conducted at the same 10 sites in the U.S. as our completed Phase 2 clinical trial in older adults. The primary objectives of the trial evaluated safety and serum anti-F IgG antibody concentrations in response to immunization with the RSV F Vaccine. The exploratory objectives of the trial evaluated the efficacy of a second annual dose of the RSV F Vaccine in the prevention of RSV ARD and RSV msLRTD. Participants previously randomized to receive 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo were re-enrolled and re-randomized in the current trial to receive either 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo. This resulted in analysis of four separate trial arms: a) participants receiving a placebo in both the first trial and second trial (“Placebo-Placebo”); b) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in the first trial and placebo in the second trial (“Vaccine-Placebo”); c) participants receiving placebo in the first trial and RSV F Vaccine in the second trial (“Placebo-Vaccine”); and d) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in both the first trial and second trial (“Vaccine-Vaccine”).

The rollover trial demonstrated immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients, with a 6-fold increase in anti-F IgG in the Placebo-Vaccine arm, consistent with the Phase 2 efficacy trial. There was higher anti-F IgG at baseline in the Vaccine-Vaccine arm compared to the Placebo-Vaccine arm and the Vaccine-Vaccine arm showed a greater than 2-fold increase in anti-F IgG from the higher baseline. The rollover trial confirmed the low attack rates witnessed during the Resolve trial.
 
Phase 2 Trial in Older Adults (Completed)
 
In August 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 1,600 older adults. The clinical trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with RSV infection, in community-living older adults who were treated with placebo. The trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Finally, the trial estimated the efficacy of our RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to RSV. The trial was the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active RSV immunization in any clinical trial population. In the per protocol population, the clinical trial showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease (41%) and, in an ad hoc analysis, showed a decrease in RSV disease with any symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (45%) in older adults. The clinical trial established an attack rate for symptomatic RSV disease of 4.9% in older adults, 95% of which included lower respiratory track symptoms. Efficacy against more severe RSV illness, defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms or signs associated with difficulty breathing, was 64% in ad hoc analyses.
RSV Pediatric Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
There are currently approximately 18 million children in the U.S. between six months and five years of age.18 In the U.S., RSV is responsible for approximately 57,000 hospitalizations of children under five years of age annually, the vast majority of which occur in infants less than one year old, and especially those under six months of age. 19,20,21,22,23
 
 Clinical Trial Update
 
In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine, with one or two doses, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Trial enrollment was concluded with a smaller than planned cohort so that dosing could be completed ahead of the 2014-2015 RSV season. The vaccine was well-tolerated and serum samples collected from a subset of 18 immunized children in the per-protocol population, demonstrated that the RSV F Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all formulations and regimens. There were greater than 10-fold increases in both anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the adjuvanted group and greater than 6-fold increases in anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the unadjuvanted group. We are assessing the next steps in the development of our RSV F Vaccine for pediatrics.
Emerging Disease
 
Ebola Virus 
 
EBOV, formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Multiple strains of EBOV have been identified, the most recent of which, the Makona EBOV strain, is associated with a case fatality rate of 50% to 90%.24 There are currently no licensed treatments proven to neutralize the virus, but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development. Despite the development of such therapies, current vaccine approaches target either a previous strain of the virus or were initially developed to be delivered by genetic vectors. In contrast, our EBOV glycoprotein vaccine candidate (“Ebola GP Vaccine”) was developed using the Makona EBOV strain.

In July 2015, we announced top-line data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our Ebola GP Vaccine in ascending doses, with and without our Matrix-M adjuvant, in 230 healthy adults. Participants received either one or two intramuscular injections ranging from 6.5µg to 50µg of antigen, with or without adjuvant, or placebo. Immunogenicity was assessed at multiple time points, including days 28 and 35. These Phase 1 data demonstrated that our Ebola GP Vaccine is highly immunogenic, well-tolerated and, in conjunction with our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, resulted in significant antigen dose-sparing. Although the adjuvanted Ebola GP Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all dose levels, the adjuvanted two-dose regimens induced Ebola anti-GP antibody geometric mean responses between 45,000 and 70,000 ELISA units, representing a 500 to 750-fold rise over baseline at day 35. In 2015, we also announced successful data from two separate non-human primate challenge studies of our Ebola GP Vaccine in which, in both cases, the challenge was lethal for the control animal, whereas 100% of the immunized animals were protected.
 
ZIKV EnvD Vaccine
 
We initiated development of a vaccine against the Zika virus (“ZIKV”) in response to the unmet global medical need for a response to this serious disease. Beginning in 2015, ZIKV spread in South, Central and North America, via mosquito-borne and sexual transmission. Although acute ZIKV infections in adults are generally either asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms (fever, joint pains and skin rash), more serious outcomes can occur, including Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and, microcephaly in infants of women infected during pregnancy. There is no approved vaccine against ZIKV, although a number of companies have announced vaccine development efforts. We are currently conducting IND-enabling preclinical studies, including studies in non-human primates and other animal models, with the goal of initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial of our ZIKV envelope dimer nanoparticle vaccine candidate (“ZIKV EnvD Vaccine”) in 2017.
 
Seasonal Influenza
 
Influenza is a world-wide infectious disease that causes illness in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening or even death. Serious illness occurs not only in susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults, but also in the general population largely because of unique strains of influenza for which most humans have not developed protective antibodies. Current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccine growth in the top seven markets (U.S., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), show a potential increase from approximately $3.2 billion in the 2012-2013 season to $5.3 billion by the 2021-2022 season.25
 
The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommends that all persons aged six months and older be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza. Influenza is a major burden on public health worldwide: an estimated one million deaths each year are attributed to influenza.26 It is further estimated that, each year, influenza attacks between 5% and 10% of adults and 20% to 30% of children, causing significant levels of illness, hospitalization and death.27 Recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines, like the candidate we are developing, have an important advantage: once licensed for commercial sale, large quantities of such vaccine can potentially be manufactured quickly and in a cost-effective manner, without the use of either the live influenza virus or eggs.

After many years of developing virus-like particle (“VLP”)-based seasonal influenza vaccine candidates, we have identified advantages of developing nanoparticle-based seasonal influenza vaccines. In particular, influenza nanoparticles can display conserved antigenic regions, which have the potential to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that may offer protection against a range of drifted strains. Additionally, nanoparticles offer improved purity and manufacturability and advantages for co-formulation with other nanoparticle-based vaccines. We expect to continue to develop our nanoparticle influenza vaccine program in 2017 with an ongoing goal of generating additional proof-of-concept data.
Combination Respiratory Vaccine
 
Given the ongoing development of our RSV F Vaccine and our desire to develop a combination respiratory vaccine with the potential to protect against both RSV and seasonal influenza, we made the decision to shift our seasonal influenza vaccine development focus from VLP-based seasonal influenza vaccines to nanoparticle-based seasonal influenza vaccines. Early preclinical development efforts give us confidence that such a combination vaccine is feasible.
CPLB Joint Venture (India)
 
CPL Biologicals Private Limited (“CPLB”), our joint venture company with Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Cadila”) in India, is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by us. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila. CPLB operates a manufacturing facility in India for the production of vaccines.
Seasonal Influenza
 
CPLB received marketing authorization, the Indian equivalent of approval of a Biologics License Application, for its trivalent seasonal VLP influenza vaccine and is currently manufacturing with limited sales in 2016 and limited expected sales in 2017.
Rabies
 
In October 2016, CPLB initiated its Phase 3 clinical trial in India of a rabies G protein vaccine candidate that we genetically engineered, and that can be administered both as a pre-exposure and a post-exposure prophylactic regimen. The post-exposure regimen has the potential to use fewer doses (three doses) than the current standard of care (five doses).
Vaccine Technology
 
Our recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine technology is based on self-assembly of surface protein antigens from pathogenic organisms including viruses, bacteria or parasites. The conformations of these nanoparticles are similar but not identical to the natural structure of surface antigens of disease organisms, and lack the genetic material required for replication and therefore are not infectious. Potential immunological advantages of protein nanoparticles may be associated with the nanoparticle conformation and the presentation of key functional epitopes that are often immunologically hidden in the native pathogen. This leads to efficient recognition by the immune system’s antigen presenting cells that trigger robust immune responses. Recognition of the nanoparticle vaccine’s repeating protein patterns by the antigen presenting cells’ toll-like receptors to stimulate innate immunity and the high purity and lack of synthetic material adds to the potential safety of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines. Protein nanoparticle vaccine technology has expanded our early-stage vaccines in development to include both virus and non-virus disease targets. Our most advanced protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate is our RSV F Vaccine, which self-assembles from our highly purified F-protein antigen.
Matrix Adjuvants
 
Adjuvants are predominantly used to enable a vaccine to increase the amplitude of the immune response and qualitatively change it, broaden its specificity to provide protection against related microorganisms and allow for effective immunization with much lower doses of antigen. Novavax AB has developed a number of adjuvant formulations, all based on our proprietary Matrix™ technology. These adjuvant formulations possess excellent immunostimulatory features with the ability to increase and prolong the protective benefits of vaccines.

While adjuvants based on novel, poorly characterized substances have been hampered by safety concerns and limited efficacy, Matrix adjuvants stimulate strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Matrix adjuvants may allow for lower antigen doses, longer-duration immune responses and carry a lower risk for allergic reactions or other adverse events. Our Matrix technology typically induces strong cellular activation of both Th1 and Th2 types, thereby generating all classes and subclasses of antibodies, as well as potent cellular responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Our Matrix-M adjuvant provides a potent adjuvant effect that has been well tolerated in clinical trials. We also believe that the strong immune response and opportunity to reduce the quantity of antigen dose can significantly reduce the production cost of our vaccines. This means that our Matrix-M adjuvant has the potential to be of significant value when there is inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity during an emerging disease threat such as an influenza pandemic.
 
Competition in RSV, EBOV, ZIKV, Influenza and Other Vaccines
 
The vaccine market is intensely competitive, characterized by rapid technological progress. Our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make recombinant vaccines. We believe this system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely well-suited for developing RSV and influenza vaccines, as well as vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases.
 
There is currently no approved RSV vaccine for sale in the world; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. In addition, many other companies are developing products to prevent disease caused by RSV using a variety of technology platforms, including various viral vector technologies and competitive recombinant technologies. We believe that our RSV vaccine candidate, utilizing a recombinant F-protein antigen, is more effective than RSV vaccine candidates in development by our competitors; however, such efficaciousness cannot be guaranteed. Although we are not aware of all our competitors’ efforts, we believe that MedImmune, LLC (“MedImmune”), a subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, may have the second most advanced RSV vaccine program after Novavax, as it has reported testing in Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials of an intranasal, recombinant, live attenuated, RSV vaccine for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, as well as a combination intranasal vaccine for the prevention of several infant respiratory illnesses, including RSV. In older adults, MedImmune also conducted a Phase 2 trial of MEDI-7510 (recombinant F subunit with an adjuvant administered intramuscularly). In both MedImmune vaccine programs, the trials did not report complete success. Additional entities have also entered into early clinical trials including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Bavarian Nordic, J&J/Crucell, Immunovaccine, Mucosis, Vaxart and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an institute under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIAID”).
 
Vaccine candidates against EBOV have been in development for more than a decade; however, with the recent epidemic in West Africa (now subsided), focus on viable vaccine candidates has intensified. The WHO has reported two vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in humans: one by GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with NIAID, and the other by a collaboration of NewLink Genetics, Merck Vaccines USA (“Merck”) and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Merck vaccine is the only one to have completed some human trials before the epidemic faded, published their data, and now filing for licensure. While these and other vaccine candidates offer promise, we believe there are accompanying challenges, including: high-dose level requirements; utilization of glycoprotein from older strains that have a significant number of amino acid changes when compared to the 2014 Makona strain; difficult storage requirements at temperatures below –60°C; and challenges associated with immunity to the viral vectors, which could limit their multi-dose vaccine potential. In contrast, we have developed a Phase 1 vaccine candidate that has performed well with low doses utilizing our Matrix-M adjuvant, was derived from the 2014 Makona strain, appears to be stable at 2–8°C and appears to provide enhanced immunogenicity as a multi-dose vaccine.
 
Although we are not aware of all our competitors’ efforts, we believe there are over 25 vaccines in development for ZIKV, which include candidates from large vaccine companies, smaller biotech companies and governmental research institutions. Many of these programs have external funding from a third party source. At least three vaccines are currently in Phase 1 clinical trials (Inovio, NIAID and WRAIR/Sanofi), while others, including Novavax, are in preclinical development. We believe that Inovio initiated the first ZIKV vaccine clinical trial in July 2016; however, additional clinical trials are expected to start with candidates from Takeda, Moderna/Valera, Baharat (India), NIAID (various live attenuated formulations) and Themis (EU). There are at least six primary vaccine technology platforms being applied, including DNA, mRNA, inactivated whole virus, live attenuated, recombinant proteins/subunit and vector-based genetics with some novel variations within each platform. Our ZIKV vaccine candidate is based on highly purified ZIKV envelope protein dimers (“EnvD”) stabilized with a proprietary formulation. In addition, our ZIKV vaccine has a highly conserved quartinary neutralizing epitope that appears, in animal studies, to induce neutralizing antibody responses against multiple stains of ZIKV and other flaviviruses. While we have not yet tested our ZIKV vaccine candidate in humans, we believe that its development profile suggests broad protection, high efficacy and good stability.

There are a number of companies developing and selling vaccines for seasonal influenza employing both traditional and new vaccine technologies. Many seasonal influenza vaccines are currently approved and marketed, and most of these are marketed by major pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise. Competition in the sale of seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, some by adding an adjuvant that is used to increase the immunogenicity of that product, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than currently marketed products. Another differentiating factor is recombinant manufacturing, which we believe can be quicker and less-expensive than traditional egg-based manufacturing. Despite the significant competition and advancing technologies, some of which are similar to our own, we believe that our nanoparticle seasonal influenza product could be as efficacious as, or more so than, current products or products being developed by our competitors, and that our manufacturing system provides savings in both time and money; however, there can be no guarantee that our seasonal influenza vaccine will prove to be efficacious or that our manufacturing system will prove to be sufficiently effective and differentiated to ensure commercial success.
 
In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also may depend upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sale.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the U.S. and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

· | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third-parties, which may be protected by patents; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.

Government Regulations
 
The development, production and marketing of biological products, which included the vaccine candidates being developed by Novavax or our collaborators, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. As a U.S. based company, we focus on the U.S. regulatory process and the standards imposed by the FDA, International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) and other agencies because we believe, for the most part, meeting U.S. and ICH standards will allow us to satisfy regulatory agencies in other countries where we intend to do business. We are aware that expectations in some venues, notably in the European Union, differ to some degree and we are taking proactive steps to address such differences. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and biological products are subject to regulation under provisions of that act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but it also regulates, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA licensure for a new vaccine is costly and time-consuming.
 
Vaccine clinical development follows the same general regulatory pathway as drugs and other biologics. Before applying for FDA licensure to market any new vaccine candidate, we expect to first submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that explains to the FDA, among other things, the results of preclinical toxicology testing conducted in laboratory animals, the method of manufacture, quality control tests for release, the stability of the investigational product and what we propose to do for human testing. At this stage, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the vaccine candidate in humans. We must then conduct Phase 1 clinical trials and larger-scale Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Once these trials are complete, a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) can be submitted to the FDA requesting licensure of the vaccine for marketing based on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.
 
During the FDA’s review of a BLA, the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre-approval inspection during which the FDA examines in detail the production of the vaccine, the manufacturing facility and the quality documentation related to the vaccine. Vaccine licensure also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine’s proper use, including its potential benefits and risks, to communicate with patients and parents, and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public. Until a vaccine is given to the general population, all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated. Thus, the FDA typically requires Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials for vaccines after licensure to continue gathering safety, and sometimes effectiveness/efficacy data in the indicated and additional populations.
 
In order to ensure continuing safety, the FDA continues to oversee the production of vaccines even after the vaccine and manufacturing processes are approved. For example, monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the product. Manufacturers may also be required to submit to the FDA the results of their own tests for potency, safety and purity for each vaccine lot, if requested by the FDA. They may also be required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to the FDA for testing.
 
In addition to obtaining FDA licensure for each product, each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA, is subject to FDA inspection and must comply with cGMP regulations. To supply products for use either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., including clinical trials, U.S. and foreign manufacturing establishments, including third-party facilities, must comply with GMP regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country.
 
In 1992, the FDA instituted regulations that allow approval of certain products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint, versus a clinical outcome, which can take many more years to demonstrate. Surrogate endpoints, generally a laboratory measurement or other physical sign shown to have some correlation with clinical benefit, can considerably shorten the development time leading up to FDA licensure. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept a proposed surrogate endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. The company developing the product is required to conduct further studies to confirm the clinical benefit in Phase 4 confirmatory efficacy trials. We plan to seek traditional approval for our seasonal influenza vaccine, but have not ruled out the potential use of accelerated approval for specific populations and/or for potential pandemic influenza vaccine candidates.

In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the U.S., an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed. No such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate marketing application. FDA licensure does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. In addition, in many countries, the government is involved in the pricing of the product. In such cases, the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
 
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in Sweden. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
 
There have been numerous federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, the exertion of government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the U.S. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such healthcare changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our primary manufacturing facility is located at our corporate headquarters at 20 Firstfield Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The facility has 53,000 square feet of combined GMP manufacturing and laboratory space. Our Rockville, Maryland facility houses our 10,000 square foot GMP pilot manufacturing facility that produces early-stage clinical trial material. Novavax AB, located in Uppsala, Sweden, produces our Matrix adjuvants in an approximately 24,000 square foot facility comprised of GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space.
Sources of Supply
 
Most of the raw materials and other supplies required in our business are generally available from established vendors in quantities adequate to meet our needs. In some cases, we have only qualified one vendor for certain of our manufacturing components. Prior to the initiation of commercial production, we plan, where feasible, to qualify multiple vendors of critical raw materials. One key vendor is GE Healthcare Company (“GEHC”), which supplies disposable components, resins, media and buffers used in our manufacturing process. GEHC and other vendors that supply our key manufacturing materials have been or will be audited for compliance with GMP standards.
 
An important component of our Matrix adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) that grows mainly in Chile, and we have been able to acquire high-quality quillaja extract as needed from our current suppliers.

Business Development
 
We believe our proprietary vaccine technology affords us a range of traditional and non-traditional commercialization options that are broader than those of existing vaccine companies. We strive to create sustainable value by working to obtain non-dilutive funding, similar to our agreement with BMGF to fund our RSV program, that would allow for:

· | continued development of our vaccine candidates until such vaccines can be licensed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | retained commercial rights in one or more major markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | product sales revenue; and
--+---------------------------


· | in certain markets, commercialized products through partners and other strategic relationships.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our aforementioned agreement with BMGF, another example of a strategic relationship is our joint venture we established with Cadila. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila. It was established in 2009 to develop and manufacture certain vaccine candidates, biogeneric products and diagnostic products for the territory of India. CPLB operates a manufacturing facility in India for the production of vaccines and is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by us.
 
Employees
 
As of February 23, 2017, we have 355 full-time employees, of whom 65 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 107 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 304 are engaged primarily in research, development and manufacturing activities and 51 are engaged primarily in executive, business development, finance and accounting, legal and administrative functions. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements; 33 of our 34 Swedish employees are covered by typical collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
