ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
SPK Acquisition Corp. (“SPK,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware company incorporated on December 31, 2020 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses.
 
On June 10, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000.
 
On June 10, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (“Private Placement”) with SPK Acquisition LLC (the “Sponsor”), of 205,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,050,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. The Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances) until the completion of SPK’s initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
On July 20, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 91,196 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulting in total gross proceeds of $911,960. The closing of the over-allotment option occurred on July 22, 2021. Simultaneously with the sale of the additional Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,824 Private Units at $10.00 per additional Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $18,240. On the same date, the underwriters canceled the remainder of the over-allotment option. In connection with the cancellation of the remainder of the over-allotment option, on July 22, 2021, the Company cancelled an aggregate of 164,701 shares of Common Stock issued prior to the IPO and Private Placement to the Sponsor.
 
A total of $50,911,960 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the Private Placement, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend SPK’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of SPK’s public shares to seek redemption in connection with SPK’s initial business combination or SPK’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if SPK does not complete its initial business combination by March 10, 2022 (nine months from the closing of the IPO, or 12 or 15 months, if extended as described herein), or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.
 
General
 
We are a Delaware blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. Although at the time of our IPO we initially intended to focus on operating businesses in Asia focused on the telecommunications, media, and technology (“TMT”) sectors, due to various factors we decided to consider prospective target businesses that are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region.

If our business combination with Varian is not consummated, and we look to alternative target businesses, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies that we believe:
 

● | Strong management team. The strength of the management team will be an important component in our review process. We will seek to partner with a management team that is operationally strong and has demonstrated the ability to scale, but is also well-incentivized and aligned in our future vision for creating long term shareholder value. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong and defensible market position. We intend to favor targets that have a strong competitive advantage or are advanced in their penetration of new and emerging markets. We will target companies that have strong intellectual property, technology, or brand equity within their respective sectors and that can be further monetized on a global basis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At a growth inflection point. We intend to seek targets that may benefit from capital infusions that will be used to fund higher growth through expansion into new markets and product offerings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from being a public company. We intend to seek targets that may lack experience with the capital markets but that possess the aspiration to take advantage of improved access to capital that comes from a listing in the U.S. This improved access to capital could allow the targets to accelerate growth, pursue new projects, retain and hire employees, and expand into new geographies or businesses. Ultimately, this combination of enhanced liquidity and access to capital markets will enable our target to accelerate its growth and increase its resulting value.

While we intend to use these criteria in evaluating the attractiveness of potential business combination opportunities, we may ultimately decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, will be in the form of proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
In evaluating Varian, we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information that was made available to us. We also utilized our operational and capital allocation experience. Our acquisition criteria, due diligence processes and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. Our sole focus since the IPO has been to identify a target business for our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting an initial business combination. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various U.S. Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
 
At the time of the IPO, we anticipated that target business candidates would be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Also, by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. On October 21, 2021, we executed an engagement letter with LifeSci Capital (“LifeSci”) for LifeSci to serve as our financial advisor and assist us with sourcing potential target companies in connection with our business combination. LifeSci is a boutique investment bank focused solely on emerging life science and healthcare companies.
 
Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, also brought to our attention target business candidates that they became aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In no event, however, will any of our existing insiders, special advisors or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our insiders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. We did not establish any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of early stage or potential emerging growth companies, which we will disclose to investors in a proxy statement or registration statement to be filed in connection with the business combination. Although management endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there is no assurance that it will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
 
Pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Therefore, the fair market value of the target business will be calculated prior to any conversions of our shares in connection with a business combination and therefore will be a minimum of $40,729,568 (based on the partial exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) in order to satisfy the 80% test. While the fair market value of the target business must satisfy the 80% test, the consideration we pay the owners of the target business may be a combination of cash (whether cash from the trust account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business combination) or our equity securities. The exact nature and amount of consideration would be determined based on negotiations with the target business, although we will attempt to primarily use our equity as transaction consideration. During our negotiations with Varian, we agreed that the consideration would be in the form of 4,500,000 shares of common stock based on $10.00 per share for an aggregate consideration of $45,000,000. If our board had not been able to independently determine the fair market value of Varian, we would have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We would also have obtained a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm if we were to have consummated a business combination with an entity affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.
 
We have structured the business combination with Varian so that the post-business combination company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests in Varian. If we are unable to consummate the business combination with Varian and have to identify another target business or businesses, we may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination; 
● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to the underwriters upon consummation of our initial business combination; 
● | our obligation to either repay working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders or their affiliates; 
● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our insiders or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an initial business combination with a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
Management Operating and Investment Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.
 
As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.

Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination
 
We have until nine months from the closing of the IPO (or 12 months from the closing of the if we IPO, if have filed a proxy statement, registration statement or similar filing for an initial business combination within such nine-month period, but not completed the initial business combination within such nine-month period) to consummate our initial business combination. In addition, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination (i) within such nine-month period, in the situation where we have not filed a proxy statement, registration statement or similar filing for an initial business combination within such nine-month period, or (ii) within 12 months, in the situation where we have filed within such nine-month period, our insiders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months for a total of up to 15 months from the consummation of the IPO to complete a business combination, provided that, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposit into the trust account $509,120, based on the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, ($0.10 per share in either case, or an aggregate of $1,018,239 based on the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. In the event that they elect to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposit the applicable amount of money into trust, the insiders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the relevant insider’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional Private Units at a price of $10.00 per unit. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the Private Units will expire and will be worthless.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
12


We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior December 31, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial business combination with has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
