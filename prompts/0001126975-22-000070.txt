(a) General Development of Business
Unless indicated otherwise, the terms “our,” “we,” “us” and similar language refer to Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. together with its subsidiaries. Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership formed in August 2000, and our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “MMP.” Magellan GP, LLC, a wholly-owned Delaware limited liability company, serves as our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner is referred to herein as our “board”.
 In June 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our independent terminals network comprised of 26 refined petroleum products terminals with approximately six million barrels of storage located primarily in the southeastern United States (“U.S.”) to Buckeye Partners, L.P. for $435 million. The sale is expected to close upon the receipt of required regulatory approval. These assets and the related results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been classified as discontinued operations. Unless indicated otherwise, the information provided in this report relates only to our continuing operations.
(b) [Reserved.]
(c) Narrative Description of Business
We are principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil. As of December 31, 2021, our asset portfolio, excluding assets associated with discontinued operations, consisted of:
•our refined products segment, comprised of our approximately 9,800-mile refined petroleum products pipeline system with 54 terminals and two marine storage terminals (one of which is owned through a joint venture); and 
•our crude oil segment, comprised of approximately 2,200 miles of crude oil pipelines, a condensate splitter and 39 million barrels of aggregate storage capacity, of which approximately 29 million barrels are used for contract storage. Approximately 1,000 miles of these pipelines, the condensate splitter and 31 million barrels of this storage capacity (including 25 million barrels used for contract storage) are wholly-owned, with the remainder owned through joint ventures.
Industry Background
The U.S. petroleum products transportation and distribution system links sources of crude oil supply with refineries and ultimately with end users of petroleum products. This system is comprised of a network of pipelines, terminals, storage facilities, waterborne vessels, railcars and trucks. For transportation of petroleum products, pipelines are generally the most reliable, lowest cost, least carbon intensive and safest alternative for intermediate and long-haul movements between different markets. Throughout the distribution system, terminals play a key role in facilitating product movements by providing storage, distribution, blending and other ancillary services. 
The following terms are commonly used in our industry to describe products that we transport, store, distribute or otherwise handle through our petroleum pipelines and terminals:
•refined products are the output from crude oil refineries that are primarily used as fuels by consumers. Refined products include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, kerosene and heating oil. Diesel fuel, kerosene and heating oil are also referred to as distillates; 
•transmix is a mixture that forms when different refined products are transported in pipelines. Transmix is fractionated and blended into usable refined products;
•liquefied petroleum gases or LPGs are liquids produced as by-products of the crude oil refining process and in connection with natural gas production. LPGs include gas liquids such as butane, natural gasoline and propane;
•blendstocks are products blended with refined products to change or enhance their characteristics such as increasing a gasoline’s octane or oxygen content. Blendstocks include alkylates and oxygenates; and
•crude oil, which includes condensate, is a naturally occurring unrefined petroleum product recovered from underground that is used as feedstock by refineries, splitters and petrochemical facilities.
We use the term petroleum products to describe any, or a combination, of the above-noted products. In addition, we handle, store and distribute renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel.
Description of Our Businesses
REFINED PRODUCTS
Our refined products segment consists of our refined products pipeline system and two marine terminals. Our refined products pipeline system is the longest common carrier pipeline system for refined products and LPGs in the U.S., extending approximately 9,800 miles from the Texas Gulf Coast and covering a 15-state area across the central U.S. The system includes approximately 47 million barrels of aggregate usable storage capacity at 54 terminals. Our Galena Park marine terminal is located along the Houston Ship Channel and has 13 million barrels of wholly-owned storage capacity and one million barrels of storage capacity that we own through a joint venture. Our Pasadena marine terminal, which we own through a joint venture, is also located along the Houston Ship Channel and has storage capacity of five million barrels.
Our refined products segment accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated revenue, operating margin and total assets:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021
Percent of consolidated revenue | 75% | 74% | 77% 
Percent of consolidated operating margin | 61% | 65% | 72% 
Percent of consolidated total assets | 61% | 61% | 61% 

See Note 4 – Segment Disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a description of the non-generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure of operating margin and additional financial information about our refined products segment. 
Operations. Transportation, Terminalling and Ancillary Services. During 2021, approximately 70% of the refined products segment’s revenue (excluding product sales revenue) was generated from transportation tariffs on volumes shipped on our refined products pipeline system. These transportation tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates, where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts. All transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) or appropriate state agency. Included as part of these tariffs are charges for terminalling and storage of products at 31 of our pipeline system’s 54 terminals. Revenue from terminalling and storage at the other 23 terminals on our refined products pipeline system is derived from privately negotiated rates. Under our tariffs, we are allowed to deduct prescribed quantities of the products our shippers transport on our pipelines, which are commonly referred to as “tender deductions,” to compensate us for lost product during shipment due to metering inaccuracies, intermingling of products between batches (transmix), evaporation or other events that result in volume shortages during the shipment process. In return for these tender deductions, our customers receive a guaranteed delivery of the gross 
volume of products they ship with us, less the amount of our tender deductions, irrespective of the actual amount of product shortages we incur during the shipment process. 
In 2021, the products transported on our refined products pipeline system were comprised of 56% gasoline, 38% distillates and 6% aviation fuel and LPGs. Our refined products pipeline system generates additional revenue from providing pipeline capacity and tank storage services, as well as providing services such as terminalling, ethanol and biodiesel unloading and loading, additive injection, custom blending, laboratory testing and data services to shippers, which are performed under a mix of “as needed,” monthly and long-term agreements. 
Our marine terminals generate revenue primarily by providing storage and related services, including dock capabilities, pursuant to privately negotiated contracts.
Commodity-Related Activities.  Substantially all of the transportation, throughput and storage services we provide are for third parties, and we do not take title to their products. We do take title to products related to tender deductions, product overages, gas liquids blending and fractionation activities. The sales of these products generate product sales revenue. 
Our gas liquids blending activity primarily involves purchasing butane and blending it into gasoline, which creates additional gasoline available for us to sell. This activity is limited by seasonal changes in gasoline vapor pressure specifications and by the varying quality of the gasoline delivered to us. When the differential between the cost of gas liquids and the price of gasoline fluctuates, the product margin we earn from these activities is impacted. We generally hedge the economic margin from this blending activity by entering into forward physical or derivative contracts at the time we purchase the related gas liquids. These blending activities accounted for approximately 68% of the total product margin for the refined products segment during 2021. 
We also operate three fractionators along our pipeline system that separate transmix into gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition to fractionating the transmix that results from our pipeline operations, we also purchase and fractionate transmix from third parties and sell the resulting refined products. 
Product margin from commodity-related activities in our refined products segment was $104.7 million, $98.6 million and $133.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The amount of margin we earn from these activities and related hedges fluctuates with changes in petroleum prices (see Note 14 –Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding our hedging activities). Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure, but its components are determined in accordance with GAAP. Product margin, which is calculated as product sales revenue less cost of product sales, is used by management to evaluate the profitability of our commodity-related activities. The components of product margin included in operating profit, the nearest GAAP measurement, are provided in Note 4—Segment Disclosures to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Joint Venture Activities. We own a 50% interest in Powder Springs Logistics, LLC (“Powder Springs”), a joint venture with an affiliate of Colonial Pipeline Company, which owns a gas liquids blending system near Atlanta, Georgia. We serve as operator of the Powder Springs assets. 
We own a 50% interest in Texas Frontera, LLC (“Texas Frontera”), a joint venture with an affiliate of Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), which owns approximately one million barrels of storage at our Galena Park terminal. We serve as operator of the Texas Frontera assets.
We own an approximately 25% interest in MVP Terminalling, LLC (“MVP”), a joint venture with an affiliate of Valero Energy Corporation and an undisclosed financial investor. MVP owns a refined products marine storage terminal along the Houston Ship Channel in Pasadena, Texas, including over five million barrels of storage, two ship docks and truck loading facilities. We serve as operator of the MVP assets. See Note 7 - Investments in Non-Controlled Entities to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding the sale of a portion of our interest in MVP in 2021. 
Markets and Competition. Shipments originate on our refined products pipeline system from direct connections to refineries or through interconnections with other pipelines or terminals for transportation and ultimate distribution to retail gasoline stations, truck stops, railroads, airports and other end users. Through direct refinery connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines, our refined products system can access nearly 50% of U.S. refining capacity, and in particular is well-connected to Texas Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent refineries. As a result of its extensive connections to multiple refining regions, our pipeline system is well positioned to accommodate demand or supply shifts that may occur.
 Our system is dependent on the ability of refiners and marketers to meet the demand for refined products in the markets they serve through shipments on our pipeline system. Demand for refined products is influenced by many factors, including driving patterns and consumer preferences, economic conditions, population changes, government regulations, changes in vehicle fuel efficiency and development of alternative energy sources. Excluding recent disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for refined products in the market areas served by our pipeline system has historically been stable. We generally rely on recent historical trends on our system and third-party forecasts in assessing future refined products demand, and those forecasts vary both by forecaster and by product. While increases in vehicle efficiency and more widespread penetration of electric vehicles are generally expected to reduce demand for gasoline over time, distillate demand is expected to be less affected, while demand for aviation fuel is expected to grow. The most recently published projections by the Energy Information Administration suggest that overall demand for refined products in the areas that include markets served by our pipeline system will remain relatively stable over the next 10 years.
In 2021, approximately 60% of the products transported on our refined products pipeline system originated from direct refinery connections and 40% originated from connections with other pipelines or terminals. Our system is directly connected to and receives product from the following 17 refineries:

In certain markets, barge, truck or rail provide an alternative source for transporting refined products; however, pipelines are generally the most reliable, lowest cost, least carbon intensive and safest alternative for refined products movements between different markets. As a result, our pipeline system’s top competitors are other pipelines that serve the same markets. 

Competition with other pipeline systems is based primarily on transportation charges, quality of customer service, proximity to end users and long-standing customer relationships. However, given the different supply sources on each pipeline, commodity prices at either the origin or destination point on a pipeline may outweigh transportation costs when customers choose which pipeline to use. 

Another form of competition for pipelines is the use of exchange agreements among shippers. Under these agreements, a potential shipper agrees to supply a market near its refinery or terminal in exchange for receiving supply from another refinery or terminal in a different market. These agreements allow the two parties to reduce or eliminate the volumes transported and, therefore, the transportation fees paid to us. We compete with these alternatives through price incentives and through long-term commercial arrangements with potential exchange partners. 
Government mandates increasingly require and regulatory incentives promote the use of renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel and other renewable fuels. Pipelines have historically not shipped ethanol or biodiesel in significant quantities, but rather they are typically transported by railroad, truck or barge to terminal facilities where they are then blended into the fuel stream.  The increased use of ethanol and biodiesel has and will continue to compete with shipments on our pipeline system.  Our terminals have the necessary infrastructure to blend ethanol and certain locations blend biodiesel with refined products, and we earn revenue for these services. In addition, we have the potential to and recently began moving blended renewable fuels on our pipeline system in limited quantities.
Our marine storage terminals compete with other terminals with respect to location, price, versatility and services provided. The competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, independent terminal companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading operations.
Customers and Contracts. Our refined products pipeline system provides services to several different types of customers, including refiners, wholesalers, retailers, traders, railroads, airlines and regional farm cooperatives. End markets for refined products deliveries are primarily retail gasoline stations, truck stops, farm cooperatives, railroad fueling depots, military bases and commercial airports. Published tariffs serve as contracts, and shippers nominate the volume to be shipped up to a month in advance. In addition, we enter into agreements with shippers that commonly result in payment, volume or term commitments in exchange for reduced tariff rates or expansion capital spending on our part. For 2021, approximately 50% of the shipments on our pipeline system were subject to these supplemental agreements. The average remaining life of these agreements was approximately five years as of December 31, 2021. While many of these supplemental agreements do not represent guaranteed volumes, they do reflect a significant level of shipper commitment to our refined products pipeline system.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, our refined products pipeline system had approximately 60 transportation customers. The top 10 shippers primarily included independent refining companies, integrated oil companies and traders. Revenue attributable to these top 10 shippers for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 37% of total revenue for our refined products segment and 57% of revenue excluding product sales. 

Customers of our marine terminals include refiners, marketers and traders. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 67% of our marine storage capacity available for contract, including the storage capacity of our joint ventures, was subject to agreements with terms in excess of one year or that renew on an annual basis at our customers’ option. The weighted average remaining life of our marine storage contracts was approximately two years as of December 31, 2021. These contracts obligate the customer to pay for terminal capacity reserved even if not used by the customer.
Product sales are primarily to trading and marketing companies active in the markets we serve. These sales agreements are generally short-term in nature. 
CRUDE OIL
Our crude oil segment is comprised of approximately 2,200 miles of crude oil pipelines, a condensate splitter and storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 39 million barrels, of which 29 million barrels are used for contract storage. Approximately 1,000 miles of these pipelines, the condensate splitter and 31 million barrels of this storage capacity (including 25 million barrels used for contract storage) are wholly-owned, with the remainder owned through joint ventures.
The joint ventures in our crude oil segment are BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC (“BridgeTex”), Double Eagle Pipeline LLC (“Double Eagle”), HoustonLink Pipeline Company, LLC (“HoustonLink”), Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC (“Saddlehorn”) and Seabrook Logistics, LLC (“Seabrook”).
Our crude oil segment accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated revenue, operating margin and total assets:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021
Percent of consolidated revenue | 25% | 26% | 23% 
Percent of consolidated operating margin | 39% | 35% | 28% 
Percent of consolidated total assets | 34% | 35% | 35% 

See Note 4 – Segment Disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional financial information about our crude oil segment.
Operations.  Our crude oil assets are strategically located to serve crude oil supply, trading and demand centers. Revenue is generated primarily through transportation tariffs on our crude oil pipelines, storage fees from our crude oil terminals, pipeline capacity fees and tolling fees from our condensate splitter. In addition, we earn revenue for ancillary services including terminal throughput fees. We generally do not take title to the products we ship or store for our crude oil customers. Our tariffs provide for tender deductions to compensate us for lost product during shipment due to metering inaccuracies, evaporation or other events that result in volume losses during the shipment process, and we take title to these products. We also take title to products in connection with our crude oil marketing activities.
Our 450-mile Longhorn pipeline has the capacity to transport approximately 275,000 barrels per day (“bpd”) of crude oil from the Permian Basin in West Texas to Houston, Texas. Shipments originate on the Longhorn pipeline via trucks or interconnections with crude oil gathering systems owned by third parties and are delivered to our terminal at East Houston or to various points on the Houston Ship Channel, including multiple refineries connected to our Houston distribution system. 
Our East Houston terminal includes approximately nine million barrels of crude oil storage, with approximately six million barrels used for contract storage and three million barrels dedicated to the operation of the Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines. (See discussion of our BridgeTex joint venture under Joint Venture Activities below). Our East Houston terminal is also connected to our Houston distribution system and to third-party pipelines. Currently, Argus’ West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) Houston price assessment is based on trades at the terminal, and the terminal is a delivery point for the recently initiated Midland WTI American Gulf Coast futures contract traded on the Intercontinental Exchange. 
Our Houston distribution system consists of more than 100 miles of pipeline that connect our East Houston terminal through several interchanges to various points, including multiple refineries throughout the Houston area and crude oil import and export facilities, including through the facility owned by Seabrook discussed below. In addition, it is directly connected to other third-party crude oil pipelines providing us access to crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, the strategic crude oil trading hub in Cushing, Oklahoma and crude oil imports. 
Our Cushing terminal consists of approximately 13 million barrels of crude oil storage, all of which is used for contract storage. The facility primarily receives and distributes crude oil via the multiple common carrier pipelines that terminate in and originate from the Cushing crude oil trading hub, including the pipeline owned by our Saddlehorn joint venture discussed below, as well as short-haul pipeline connections with neighboring crude oil terminals. 
We own approximately 400 miles of pipeline in Kansas and Oklahoma used for crude oil service. A portion of these pipelines is leased to third parties, and we earn revenue from these pipeline segments for capacity leased even if not used by the customers.
Our Corpus Christi terminal includes approximately four million barrels of storage, with a portion used for contract storage and a portion used in conjunction with our Double Eagle joint venture discussed below. This terminal receives product primarily from barges and pipelines that connect to our terminal for further distribution to end users by trucks, pipeline or waterborne vessels. Our 50,000 bpd condensate splitter with approximately two million barrels of related storage is also located at our terminal in Corpus Christi. 
Crude Oil Marketing Activities. Our crude oil marketing activities primarily involve purchasing and selling crude oil to be shipped on our Texas crude oil pipelines to facilitate intrastate shipments and maximize profitability on our crude oil pipeline assets. Earnings from these activities are primarily based on the differential in market prices for crude oil between our origin and destination points. 
Joint Venture Activities. We own a 30% interest in BridgeTex, a joint venture with an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“Plains”) and an affiliate of OMERS Infrastructure Management Inc. BridgeTex owns an approximately 400-mile pipeline capable of transporting up to 440,000 bpd of Permian Basin crude oil to our East Houston terminal. We serve as the operator of BridgeTex. We also have a long-term lease agreement with BridgeTex to provide it with capacity on our Houston distribution system.
We own a 50% interest in Double Eagle, a joint venture with an affiliate of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (“Kinder”), that transports condensate from the Eagle Ford basin in South Texas via an approximately 200-mile pipeline to our terminal in Corpus Christi or to an inter-connecting pipeline that transports product to the Houston area. An affiliate of Kinder serves as the operator of Double Eagle. We have entered into a terminal throughput agreement which provides Double Eagle access to our Corpus Christi terminal.
We own a 50% interest in HoustonLink, a joint venture with an affiliate of TC Energy Corporation (“TC Energy”). HoustonLink owns a crude oil pipeline connecting TC Energy’s Houston terminal, which is a termination point for TC Energy’s Marketlink pipeline, to our nearby East Houston terminal. We serve as operator of HoustonLink. 
We own a 30% interest in Saddlehorn, a joint venture with an affiliate of Plains, an affiliate of Western Midstream Partners, L.P. and an affiliate of Black Diamond Gathering LLC (which is majority-owned by Chevron Corporation). Saddlehorn owns an undivided joint interest in an approximately 600-mile pipeline, capable of transporting up to 290,000 bpd of crude oil from the DJ Basin as well as other Rocky Mountain production regions to storage facilities in Cushing, including our Cushing terminal. We serve as operator of Saddlehorn and also have a long-term agreement to provide storage for Saddlehorn at our Cushing terminal. 
We own a 50% interest in Seabrook, a joint venture with an affiliate of LBC Tank Terminals, LLC (“LBC”). Seabrook owns approximately four million barrels of crude oil storage (three million barrels of which is used for contract storage) located in Seabrook, Texas, a pipeline connecting Seabrook’s storage facilities through a third-party pipeline to a Houston-area refinery and another pipeline connecting its facility to our Houston distribution system. LBC serves as operator of the Seabrook terminal and the general and administrative operator of the entity, while we serve as operator of the Seabrook pipelines. In addition, we have a long-term lease agreement with Seabrook that we utilize to provide our customers with crude oil storage capacity and dock access for crude oil imports and exports on the Texas Gulf Coast.
Markets and Competition. Market conditions experienced by our crude oil pipelines vary significantly by location. The Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines deliver Permian Basin production to trading and demand centers in the Houston area, and consequently depend on the level of production in the Permian Basin for supply. Demand for shipments to the Houston area is driven primarily by the utilization of West Texas crude oil by Gulf Coast refineries and the price for crude oil on the Gulf Coast relative to its price in alternative markets, including export markets. Permian Basin production varies based on numerous factors including overall crude oil prices and changes in costs of production, while Gulf Coast demand for Permian Basin production also fluctuates based on relative prices for competing crude oil or changes by refineries to their crude oil processing slates, as well as by overall domestic and international demand for petroleum products. The Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines compete with alternative outlets for Permian Basin production, including pipelines that transport crude oil to the Cushing crude oil trading hub as well as other pipelines that transport Permian Basin crude to Houston, Corpus Christi or Nederland. These pipelines also compete with truck and rail alternatives for Permian Basin barrels. Further, these pipelines indirectly compete with other alternatives for delivering similar quality crude oil to the Gulf Coast, including pipelines from other producing regions such as the Mid-Continent, Bakken, Eagle Ford or Gulf of Mexico, as well as waterborne imports. Competition is based primarily on tariff rates, proximity to supply sources and demand centers, connectivity, service offerings, crude quality and customer relationships. 
Volumes transported on our Houston distribution system are driven by supply of crude oil delivered into our system from the basins connected by our pipelines or third party pipelines, as well as by takeaway demand from the various connections off our system in the Houston area. Our Houston distribution system competes with other 
distribution systems in the Houston area based primarily on rates, connectivity to supply sources and demand centers, customer service, crude quality and customer relationships. 
Our crude oil storage in Cushing serves customers who value Cushing’s location as an interchange point for numerous interstate pipelines, including Saddlehorn, and its status as a crude oil trading hub. Demand for crude oil storage in Cushing could be affected by changes in crude oil pipeline flows that change the volume of crude oil that flows through or is stored in Cushing, as well as by developments of alternative trading hubs that reduce Cushing’s relative importance. In addition, demand for our storage services in Cushing could be affected by crude oil price volatility or price structures or by regulatory or financial conditions that affect the ability of our customers to store or trade crude oil. We compete in Cushing with numerous other storage providers, with competition based on a combination of connectivity, storage rates and other terms, customer service and customer relationships. 
The Double Eagle pipeline depends on condensate production from the Eagle Ford basin for its supply and competes primarily with other pipelines and supply alternatives that are capable of transporting condensate from the Eagle Ford production area. Competition is based primarily on tariff rates, connectivity, customer service and customer relationships. Eagle Ford production may vary based on numerous factors including overall crude oil prices and changes in costs of production. Demand for our storage at Corpus Christi is subject to similar market conditions and competitive forces.
Our condensate splitter at our Corpus Christi terminal depends on condensate production and overall demand for products derived from condensate, including naphthas and distillates. Our splitter competes with other facilities in the Gulf Coast region including other splitters and refineries, as well as export alternatives.
The Saddlehorn pipeline depends on crude oil production primarily from the DJ Basin and broader Rocky Mountain region for its supply and competes primarily with other pipelines and supply alternatives that are capable of transporting crude oil from these production areas. Competition is based primarily on tariff rates, connectivity, customer service, crude quality and customer relationships. The demand for Saddlehorn’s services could be affected by changes in DJ Basin crude oil production and additional investment in competing transportation alternatives out of the basin, as well as the status of Cushing as a crude oil trading hub. DJ Basin production may vary based on numerous factors including overall crude oil prices and changes in costs of production.
Customers and Contracts. We ship crude oil as a common carrier for several different types of customers, including crude oil producers and end users, such as refiners and marketing and trading companies, including our marketing affiliate. Published transportation tariffs filed with the FERC or the appropriate state agency serve as contracts to ship on our crude oil pipelines, and shippers nominate volumes to be transported up to a month in advance, with rates varying by origin, destination and product grade. We typically reserve at least 10% of the shipping capacity of our pipelines for spot shippers. Spot barrel movements on our pipelines generally ship at higher rates than those charged to committed shippers. Generally, we seek to secure long-term commitments to support our long-haul crude oil pipeline assets. The majority of the capacity on our Longhorn pipeline is supported by take-or-pay commitments. At December 31, 2021, approximately 75% of the capacity of our Longhorn pipeline was subject to commitments with a weighted average remaining life of approximately six years. Our Houston distribution system is generally not subject to long-term commitments. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our crude oil storage available for contract was under agreements with terms in excess of one year or that renew on an annual basis at our customers’ option. The weighted average remaining life of our storage contracts was approximately three years as of December 31, 2021. These agreements obligate the customer to pay for storage capacity reserved even if not used by the customer. Our BridgeTex and Saddlehorn joint ventures also have take-or-pay customer commitments. At December 31, 2021, approximately 70% of the capacity of the BridgeTex pipeline was subject to commitments with a weighted average remaining life of four years. At December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of the capacity of the Saddlehorn pipeline was subject to commitments with a weighted average remaining life of five years. Additionally, we have a tolling agreement with one customer for the exclusive use of our condensate splitter in Corpus Christi, the initial term of which expires in 2023.
GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION

Commodity Positions and Hedges
Our policy is generally to purchase only those products necessary to conduct our normal business activities. We generally do not acquire physical inventory, futures contracts or other derivative instruments for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes. Our gas liquids blending, fractionation and petroleum products marketing activities result in our carrying significant levels of petroleum products inventories. In addition, we hold positions related to tender deductions and product overages. We use forward physical contracts and derivative instruments to hedge against commodity price changes and manage risks associated with our various commodity purchase and sale activities. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative instrument positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity to help ensure that our hedging activities address the risks inherent in our commodity positions.
Regulation
Tariff Regulation. Our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and related rules and orders. FERC regulation requires that interstate liquids pipeline rates be filed with the FERC, be posted publicly, be “just and reasonable” and not be unduly discriminatory. Rate changes and the overall level of our rates may be subject to challenge by the FERC or shippers. If challenged and the FERC determines that our rates are not “just and reasonable,” we may be required to reduce our rates and pay refunds for up to two years of over-earning. The rates on approximately 30% of the shipments on our refined products pipeline system are regulated by the FERC primarily through an index methodology. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2021, the indexing method initially provided for annual changes in rates by a percentage equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods (“PPI-FG”) plus 0.78%. Upon rehearing, the FERC lowered the index to PPI-FG minus 0.21% to be effective March 1, 2022. As an alternative to cost-of-service or index-based rates, interstate liquids pipeline companies may establish rates by obtaining authority to charge market-based rates in competitive markets or by negotiation with unaffiliated shippers. Approximately 70% of our refined products pipeline system’s markets are either subject to regulations by the states in which we operate or are approved for market-based rates by the FERC, and in both cases these rates can generally be adjusted at our discretion based on market factors. Most of the tariffs on our long-haul crude oil pipelines are established by negotiated rates that provide for annual adjustments in line with changes in the FERC index, subject to certain modifications.
Some shipments on our pipeline systems that move within a single state are considered to be in intrastate commerce. The rates, terms and conditions of service offered by our intrastate pipelines are subject to certain regulations with respect to such intrastate transportation by state regulatory authorities in the states of Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Such state regulatory authorities could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs, or could order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers if our rates are found to have been unjust.

Commodity Market Regulation. Our conduct in petroleum markets and in hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations must comply with various laws and regulations that prohibit market manipulation, including those under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the Commodity Exchange Act, as well as regulations promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. 
Renewable Fuel Standard.  We are an obligated party under the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and are required to satisfy our Renewable Volume Obligation (“RVO”) on an annual basis. To meet the RVO, the gasoline we produce in our gas liquids blending activities must either contain the mandated renewable fuel components, or credits must be purchased to cover any shortfall. We generally satisfy our RVO requirements through the purchase of credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). As the RFS program is currently structured, the RVO of all obligated parties may increase over time unless adjusted by the EPA. The ability to incorporate increasing volumes of renewable fuel 
components into fuel products and the availability of RINs may be limited, which could increase our costs to comply with the RFS standards or limit our ability to blend.
Income Taxes. We are a partnership for income tax purposes and therefore are not subject to federal or state income taxes for most of the states in which we operate. The tax on our net income is borne by our unitholders through allocation to them of their share of our taxable income. Net income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income allocated to unitholders because of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each unitholder’s tax attributes is not available to us.
As a publicly traded limited partnership, we are subject to a statutory requirement that our “qualifying income” (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, related Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service pronouncements) exceed 90% of our total gross income, determined on a calendar year basis. If our qualifying income does not meet this statutory requirement, we could be taxed as a corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our qualifying income met the statutory requirement.
Environmental, Maintenance, Safety & Security
General. The operation of our pipeline systems, terminals and associated facilities is subject to strict and complex laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, workplace safety and physical and cybersecurity. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business including the work environment, the generation and disposal of waste, discharge of process and storm water, air emissions, remediation requirements and facility design requirements to protect against releases into the environment and breaches in the security of our systems. We believe our assets are designed, operated and maintained in material compliance with these laws and regulations.
Environmental. Our estimates for remediation liabilities assume that we will be able to use traditionally acceptable remediation and monitoring methods, as well as associated engineering or institutional controls, to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. These estimates include the cost of performing environmental assessments, remediation and monitoring of the impacted environment such as soils, groundwater and surface water conditions. Our recorded environmental liabilities are estimates and total remediation costs may differ from current estimated amounts. 
We may experience future releases of regulated materials into the environment or discover historical releases that were previously unidentified. While an asset integrity and maintenance program designed to prevent, promptly detect and address releases is an integral part of our operations, damages and liabilities arising out of any environmental release from our assets identified in the future could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
Liabilities recognized for estimated environmental costs were $13.5 million and $9.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Environmental liabilities have been classified as current or noncurrent based on management’s estimates regarding the timing of actual payments. We have insurance policies that provide coverage for remediation costs and certain liabilities arising from sudden and accidental releases of products applicable to all of our assets. 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations that relate to the release of hazardous substances and solid wastes into water or soils. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. 
Our operations generate wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements as our operations routinely generate only small quantities of hazardous wastes, and we are not a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility operator that is required to obtain a RCRA hazardous waste permit. While RCRA currently exempts a number of wastes from being subject to hazardous waste requirements, including many oil and gas exploration and production wastes, the EPA could consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include non-hazardous wastes currently generated during operations, may be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly storage and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes. Changes in the regulations could materially increase our expenses. 
We own or lease properties where hydrocarbons have been handled for many years, during which operating and disposal standards have evolved. Although we believe we have utilized operating and disposal practices that at least met prevailing industry standards, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties were previously operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, to remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. 
Water Discharges. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products, and are subject to the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) and Clean Water Act (“CWA”). The OPA and CWA subject owners of facilities to strict, joint and potentially significant liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of a product spill such as natural resource damages, where the product spills into regulated waters, along federal shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. In the event of a product spill from one of our facilities into regulated waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed. States in which we operate have also enacted similar laws. The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. This law and comparable state laws require that permits be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters and impose substantial potential liability for non-compliance. Compliance with these laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local laws and regulations, which regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including certain of our facilities, and impose various operating, monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits and regulations containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe that our business will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require certain large stationary sources to obtain pre-construction permits and operating permits for greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the EPA requires the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain large greenhouse gas emissions sources, including petroleum facilities. 
Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives may attempt to further address climate change or control or limit greenhouse gas emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how they would impact our business, any such future laws or regulations could adversely affect demand for the products that we transport, store and distribute. Depending on the particular programs adopted, they could also increase our costs to operate and 
maintain our facilities by requiring that we measure and report our emissions, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our emissions, pay any taxes related to our emissions and administer and manage an emissions program, among other things. We may be unable to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged to our customers and any such recovery may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. 
Finally, many scientific studies conclude that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere affect climate changes, which could result in the increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, there may be an increased potential for adverse effects on our business.
Pipeline Safety and Maintenance.  Our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”). The HLPSA prescribes and enforces minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, including the design, construction, testing, operation and maintenance, spill response planning and overall reporting and management related to our pipeline facilities. In addition to the amended HLPSA covered in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, subsequent statutes provide the framework for the pipeline hazardous liquid safety program and include provisions related to PHMSA’s authorities, administration and regulatory activities. Over the past several years, PHMSA has taken steps to expand the regulation of rural gathering lines and impose a number of reporting and inspection requirements on regulated pipelines, and additional requirements are expected in the future. For example, PHMSA is advancing rulemaking regarding rupture detection, the installation of remotely controlled valves on newly constructed or entirely replaced hazardous liquid pipelines, regulations to address idle pipe status and revisions to the required repair criteria for integrity assessments. We believe that compliance with such regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
In addition to regulations applicable to all of our pipelines, we have undertaken additional obligations to mitigate potential risks to health, safety and the environment on our Longhorn pipeline. Our compliance with these incremental obligations is subject to the oversight of the U.S. Department of Transportation through PHMSA.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines, but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include requirements for pipeline or facility design and management.
Our marine terminals along coastal waterways are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state and municipal statutes relating to the design, installation, construction, testing, operation, replacement and management of these assets. 
Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, which, among other things, require us to organize and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations. Certain parts of this information must be reported to employees, contractors, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens upon request. We are subject to OSHA process safety management regulations and EPA risk management plan rules that are designed to identify and establish procedures to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. Compliance with these laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Security.  We are subject to both physical and cybersecurity regulations depending on the nature of the facility. Some of our assets are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the EPA, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Compliance with these regulations is achieved by creating physical 
and cybersecurity plans, physical security standards, marine terminal security drills and annual security audits of both marine and DHS-regulated facilities. Compliance with these laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.
Title or Interest to Real Property Assets 
Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property, and in some instances, these rights-of-way have limited terms that may require periodic renegotiation or, if such negotiations are unsuccessful, may require us to seek to exercise the power of eminent domain where such remedy is available. Several rights-of-way for our pipelines and other real property assets are shared with other pipelines and by third parties. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens, which may not have been subordinated to the right-of-way grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, water courses, county roads, municipal streets and state highways, and in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits or easements from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election. In some cases, properties for pipeline purposes are purchased in fee. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right of eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way and land necessary for our pipelines. In some circumstances, a pipeline may be categorized as abandoned under certain governmental regulations, which may give rise to claims that the underlying easement(s) or permit(s) have been abandoned as well and may require the removal of our pipelines. 
Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses that have been transferred to us are only transferable with the consent of the grantor of these rights, which in some instances is a governmental entity. We believe that we have obtained or will obtain sufficient third-party consents, permits and authorizations to operate our business in all material respects. 
We believe that we have satisfactory title or interest to all of our real property assets. In some cases, title or interest to our real property assets are subject to encumbrances, such as land use restrictions and/or covenants related to environmental contamination, liens for current taxes and other burdens and easements, restrictions and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject to at the time of acquisition. We do not believe any of these burdens should materially detract from the value of our real property assets or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,715 employees, primarily concentrated in the central and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. There were 854 employees assigned to our refined products segment, 253 employees assigned to our crude oil segment and 526 employees assigned to provide G&A services.  We also had 82 employees assigned to our discontinued operations. Approximately 13% of our employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (“USW”) and covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired at the end of January 2022. We are operating under a 24-hour rolling extension of this agreement while negotiations for a new agreement continue. Management expects that we will be able to successfully negotiate a new long-term agreement with the USW; however, a prolonged work stoppage by a majority of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We provide a competitive benefits package designed to attract and retain a skilled and diverse workforce. Our benefits package includes access to life and health insurance, paid parental leave, a defined benefit pension plan, a 401(k) plan and participation in our annual incentive program (“AIP”). Our performance-based AIP is intended to encourage all employees to make decisions that support our company’s financial, environmental, safety and cultural metrics. We also provide a long-term incentive plan for our management team and key employees that is aligned with our long-term financial performance.
Investing in employee training and development is crucial to retaining top talent and developing our employees into subject matter experts and leaders who solve challenges, fuel innovation and move our business strategy 
forward. Employees receive training focused on safety, leadership, respect, regulatory compliance and company policies, including our code of ethics and business conduct. In addition, we offer comprehensive on-the-job training programs for facility operations and site specific requirements, to provide our employees the knowledge they need to safely and compliantly operate our assets.
