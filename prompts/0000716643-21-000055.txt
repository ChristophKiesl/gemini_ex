Item 1.    Business
General:
Regis Corporation franchises technology-enabled hairstyling and hair care salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "RGS." Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the "Company," "we," "our," or "us," we are referring to Regis Corporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2021, the Company franchised, owned or held ownership interests in 5,917 locations worldwide. The Company's locations consist of 5,563 franchised salons, 276 company-owned salons, and 78 locations in which we maintain a non-controlling ownership interest. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar salon products and services.
The major services supplied by the salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning), hair coloring and other services. Salons also sell a variety of hair care and other beauty products. We earn royalty revenue based on service and product sales at our franchise locations, earn revenue on product sold to franchisees, and earn revenue for services and products sold at our company-owned salons. Salons operate primarily under the trade names of SmartStyle, Supercuts, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Roosters and they generally serve the value category within the industry. Salons are primarily located in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters. 
Financial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 are included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
In fiscal year 2021, we nearly completed our multi-year transformation to a technology-enabled, asset-light fully-franchised business. Since the transformation began, we have sold 4,671 salons to franchisees. As of June 30, 2021, 95.3% of our salons are owned by franchisees. Of the remaining 276 company-owned salons, approximately 130-150 will be sold in fiscal year 2022 with the remaining salons closed when the leases expire. Additionally, in fiscal year 2021, the Company closed 252 non-performing company-owned SmartStyle salons and 361 other underperforming company-owned salons. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the Company closed 250 and 133, respectively, underperforming salons at or near their lease end.
Industry Overview:
The hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently-owned and operated. However, the influence of salon chains, both franchised and company-owned, continues to grow within this market. Management believes salon chains will continue to have significant influence on this market and will continue to increase their presence.
In practically every area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar prices. The Company faces competition from chains, such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, Sport Clips and Ulta Beauty, independently-owned salons, department store salons located within malls, in-home hair services, booth rentals and blow dry bars. The Company also faces competition from other franchise organizations outside of the hair salon industry in attracting new franchisees.
At the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to establish systems and infrastructure, the ability to recruit franchisees, experienced field and salon management and stylists, and to lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality and consistency of the guest experience, convenience, location and price. The Company continually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of brand differentiation versus the competition.
Salon Franchising Program:
General.    We have various franchising programs supporting our 5,563 franchised salons as of June 30, 2021, consisting mainly of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Roosters salons. We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval, professional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of on-going support designed to help franchisees build successful businesses. Historically, we have signed the salon lease and then subleased the space to our franchisees. However, moving forward, for all new locations and most lease renewals, franchisees will sign the salon leases directly with the landlords. We have the right to approve salon leases.
Standards of Operations.    The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment, benefits and wage determination, establishing prices to charge for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established operational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design and decor and trademark usage. The Company's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the standards for each franchising program. All of the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the Company to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control day-to-day franchise operations or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company's franchise agreements do not give the Company any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of franchisees' employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor and trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees' employees' wages and benefits, hours of work, scheduling, leave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute resolution procedures, and/or discipline and discharge. 
Franchise Terms.    Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and ongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most franchise concepts, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and administers the funds on behalf of the concepts. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of franchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the Company's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location.
Additional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below:
Supercuts
Supercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination of the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements, which give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific. The development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements. Older franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights, which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements and provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that resolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store sites.
SmartStyle and Cost Cutters in Walmart Supercenters 
The majority of existing SmartStyle and Cost Cutters franchise agreements for salons located in Walmart Supercenters have a five-year term with a five-year option to renew. The franchise agreements are site specific. 
Cost Cutters (not located in Walmart Supercenters), First Choice Haircutters and Magicuts
The majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15-year term with a 15-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a ten-year term with a five-year option to renew. The majority of Magicuts franchise agreements have a term equal to the greater of five years or the current initial term of the lease agreement with an option to renew for two additional five-year periods. The current franchise agreement is site specific. Franchisees may enter into development agreements with the Company, which provide limited territorial protection.
Roosters Men’s Grooming Center
Roosters franchise agreements have a ten-year term with a ten-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee). New franchisees enter into a franchise agreement concurrent with the opening of their first store, along with a development agreement with the right to open two additional locations. 
Franchisee Training.    The Company provides new franchisees with training, focusing on the various aspects of salon management, including: operations, management training, marketing fundamentals and controls. Existing franchisees receive training, counseling and information from the Company on a regular basis. The Company provides salon managers and stylists with technical training for franchisees.
Guests
Among other factors, consistent delivery of an exceptional guest experience, haircut quality, convenience, competitive pricing, salon location, inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, differentiating benefits and guest experience elements and comprehensive retail assortments, all drive guest traffic and improve guest retention.
Guest Experience. Our portfolio of salon concepts enables our guests to select different service scheduling options based upon their preference. We believe the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times are essential elements in delivering an efficient guest experience. Our mobile applications and online check-in capabilities, including check-ins directly from Facebook Messenger® and Google®, allow us to capitalize on our guests' desire for convenience. We continue to focus on stylist staffing and retention, optimizing schedules, balancing variable labor hours with guest traffic and managing guest wait times. Our salons are located in high-traffic strip centers and Walmart Supercenters, with guest parking and easy access, and are generally open seven days per week to offer guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs. 
Affordability. The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect outstanding service at competitive prices. These expectations are met with the average service price of transactions ranging from $21 to $27. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon-level basis and are established based on local conditions. Our franchisees control all pricing at their locations.
Salon Safety, Appearance and Atmosphere. Guest and stylist safety is our first priority and became even more important by the COVID-19 global pandemic. We have invested heavily in safety and personal protective equipment, ensuring social distancing in our salons and training employees on safety measures. Our salon repairs and maintenance program is designed to ensure we invest in salon cleanliness and safety, as well as in maintaining the normal operation of our company-owned salons. The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square feet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet. 
Retail Assortments. Salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as a complete assortment of corporate-owned brand products. Stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests. Additionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of our guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include: L'Oreal Professional Brands, Regis Private Label Brands such as Designline®, Prototype® and Blossom®, and Paul Mitchell. We also distribute our Regis Blossom, Prototype and Designline brands through distribution channels, including amazon.com and walmart.com, to supplement our existing in-salon sales and raise brand awareness. 
Technology.  In fiscal year 2021, our proprietary back-office salon management system, Opensalon® Pro, became available to franchisees. Opensalon Pro gives us critical business information at the transaction level. We are building a robust business analytics platform and team that will use the data to transform the Company into a data-driven organization. This data will enable us to drive traffic into our salon, implement relevant promotions, and enhance our loyalty programs and product sales initiatives. Our mobile applications allow guests to view wait times and interact in other ways with salons.
Marketing. Our marketing is brand specific and funded primarily from contractual contributions, based on sales, to the brand's cooperative advertising funds. 
Stylists
Our Company depends on its stylists to help deliver great guest experiences. We believe in the importance of the ongoing development of our stylists' craft. We aim to be an industry leader in stylist training, including the utilization of digital training that we enhanced significantly during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Our stylists deliver a superior experience for our guests when they are well-trained technically and through years of experience. We employ trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the Company. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers that bring specialized expertise to our stylists. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate the operation of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided stylist training virtually with the benefits of maintaining social distancing, sanitization, personal protective equipment and other safety protocols.
Salon Support
Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. This acknowledges that loving our franchisees, guests and stylists mandates a service-oriented mentality in supporting our franchisees' goals as well as our company-owned operations.
Organization. Salon Support and our associated priorities are aligned with our brands to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service we provide.
Simplification. Our ongoing simplification efforts focus on aligning our cost structure with our transition to an asset-light franchise model and improving the way we plan and execute across our portfolio of brands. In fiscal year 2021, we completed a corporate reorganization based on a zero-based budgeting philosophy to ensure each employee was performing the "right work," each team was the "right size" based on resources and priorities and overall, have the "right structure" to succeed as a company. This exercise reduced salon support headcount in fiscal year 2021. 
Location. In April 2020, we relocated Salon Support to a new location in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The new headquarters facilitates collaboration amongst our internal teams, supports our employee recruiting efforts, and enhances shareholder value. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our salon support employees worked from home in fiscal year 2021 and have recently returned to the office in a modified schedule.

Human Capital Management:
Our Culture
The Company believes that being a brand citizen starts with putting your social values in the foreground, defining your purpose in the context of your core business, fostering trust among consumers, and acting with a sense of collective responsibility. In fiscal year 2021, the Company set out to develop a new vision that would allow it to become a model brand citizen. It started with stakeholder interviews with members of the Company's Board of Directors, its executive leadership team, corporate employees, franchisees, and stylists. Next, the Company facilitated a comprehensive review of brand citizen strategies in addition to primary and secondary research. As an outcome of this work, the Company defined its purpose as: Unleash the beauty of potential.
To build values reflective of this newly defined purpose, the Company assembled a cross-functional group of key leaders that represented its Board of Directors, departments throughout the Company, its franchisees, and its stylists, and all together, conducted a values workshop. As a result of this collaborative effort, the Company unveiled its values as:
Foster Trust.    Create powerful relationships by acting with empathy and integrity.
Create Community.    Connect and collaborate with all your partners. Share the challenges as much as you celebrate the wins.
Be Brave.    Dream big and courageously challenge the status quo.
Own It.    You are empowered. Take responsibility and own your role and your results.

Governmental Regulations:
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business as well as a variety of regulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty-related business, including health and safety. During the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal years 2020 and 2021, state and local governments temporarily mandated the closure of some of our franchise and company-owned salons in the response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. These government-mandated closures have and may continue throughout the pandemic. We monitor state and local regulations carefully to ensure the safety or our stylists and guests.
In the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (the FTC Rule) and by state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise operations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of a disclosure document containing specified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has registered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and in where registration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisee/franchisor relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the franchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, may prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees, and may limit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is for government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not expect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations.
In Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs by way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial franchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship requirements, such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees.
The Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all of its operations.
The Company maintains an ownership interest in Empire Education Group. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of their revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education Act of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the schools, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell our ownership interest in EEG to the other owner. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal year 2022 after receipt of state ownership transfer approvals.
