Reportable Segments
 
We have two reportable segments based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments: domestic resorts and MGM China. We currently own and operate 14 resorts in the United States. MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino (“MGM Macau”) and the development of an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau (“MGM Cotai”). We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee. See “Resort Operations” below, as well as “Executive Overview” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information related to our segments.
 
Formation and Initial Public Offering of MGP
 On April 25, 2016, MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 57,500,000 of its Class A shares representing limited liability company interests (inclusive of the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 7,500,000 Class A shares) at an initial offering price of $21 per share. MGP used the proceeds from the IPO to purchase operating partnership units in MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”), to which we contributed the real estate assets associated with The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage in exchange for Operating Partnership units in the Operating Partnership in connection with the IPO. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership (the “landlord”) subsequently leased the properties to a subsidiary of ours (the “tenant”) pursuant to a long-term triple-net master lease agreement (the “master lease”).
 MGP is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an “UPREIT”) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by, and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through the Operating Partnership. MGP contributed the proceeds from the IPO to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 26.7% of the units in the Operating Partnership. The sole general partner of the Operating Partnership is also a subsidiary of MGP. MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share. We own MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or 
 1


winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to one vote per share, while we, as the owner of the Class B share, are entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as our and our controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP’s) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. Subsequent to our acquisition of Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa (“Borgata”) on August 1, 2016 and subsequent contribution of Borgata’s real estate assets to MGP, as discussed below, our ownership in the Operating Partnership, which is controlled and consolidated by MGP, increased from 73.3% to 76.3%. As a result of the Borgata transaction, MGP’s ownership in the Operating Partnership was correspondingly reduced from 26.7% to 23.7%. The operating partnership units held by us are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the fair value of a Class A share. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee.
 
In connection with the formation of MGP, we borrowed $4.0 billion under certain bridge facilities, the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding obligations under our prior senior credit facility and to redeem our 7.5% senior notes due 2016 and our 10% senior notes due 2016. The bridge facilities were subsequently assumed by the Operating Partnership pursuant to a master contribution agreement by and between MGM, MGP and the Operating Partnership (the “master contribution agreement”). The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of proceeds from certain financing transactions and the proceeds from the IPO. 
 
Acquisition of Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa
 
On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming Corporation’s (“Boyd Gaming”) ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. Accordingly, we recorded a gain of approximately $430 million as a result of the acquisition of Borgata and resulting consolidation of Borgata, which we previously accounted for under the equity method. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. Following completion of the acquisition, MGP subsequently acquired Borgata’s real property from a subsidiary of ours in exchange for the assumption by the landlord, a subsidiary of MGP, of $545 million of indebtedness from our subsidiary and the issuance of 27.4 million Operating Partnership units to our subsidiary. In connection with the Borgata transaction, we borrowed $545 million under certain bridge facilities, which were subsequently contributed to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership repaid the bridge facilities with a combination of cash on hand and a draw down on its revolving credit facility, which it subsequently refinanced with proceeds from the offering of its 4.5% senior notes due 2026. Pursuant to an amendment to the master lease, MGP, through the landlord, leased back the real property of Borgata to the tenant and as a result, initial rent payments to MGP increased by $100 million, prorated for the remainder of the first lease year after the Borgata transaction. Consistent with the master lease terms, 90% of this rent is fixed and will contractually grow at 2% per year until 2022.
Resort Operations 
 
General 
 
Our casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments and repay debt financings.
 
We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests. The quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association as well as multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide. 
 
Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. 
 
2


All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of the year. At our domestic resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible.  
 
Our Operating Resorts 
 
We have provided certain information below about our resorts as of December 31, 2016. On August 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a consolidated subsidiary of ours. On December 8, 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort. Except as otherwise indicated, we own and operate the resorts shown below.

Domestic resorts. Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere. 
 
MGM China. We acquired an additional 4.95% interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (“MGM China”) on September 1, 2016, which increased our ownership to approximately 56%. We have a controlling interest in MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and the related gaming subconcession and land concession. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and our future property on the Cotai Strip.
 
Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and the development of MGM Cotai, discussed further below. Revenues at MGM Macau are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A., and expires in 2020. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations.
 
In October 2012, MGM Grand Paradise formally accepted the terms and conditions of a land concession contract from the government of Macau to develop MGM Cotai on an approximately 18 acre site on the Cotai Strip. The land concession contract became effective when the Macau government published the agreement in the Official Gazette of Macau on January 9, 2013 and has an initial term of 25 years. Under the terms of the land concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is required to build and open MGM Cotai by January 2018.
 
Construction of MGM Cotai commenced in 2013 and it is expected to open in the second half of 2017. China State Construction Engineering Corporation serves as the sole general contractor for the project. MGM Cotai will be an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort with capacity for up to 500 gaming tables and up to 1,500 slots, and featuring approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. The actual number of gaming tables allocated to MGM Cotai will be determined by the Macau government prior to opening, and such allocation is expected to be less than our 500 gaming table capacity. The total estimated project budget is $3.3 billion, excluding development fees eliminated in consolidation, capitalized interest and land related costs. 
 
Customers and Competition 
 
Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets we operate in, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. 
 
Our primary methods of successful competition include: 
 
 
• | Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Domestic resorts. Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts also compete, in part, with each other. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were approximately 149,300 and 149,200 guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 27% of the guestrooms in Las Vegas. Las Vegas visitor volume was 42.9 million in 2016, a 1.5% increase from the 42.3 million reported for 2015. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.
 
Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. For example, in Detroit, Michigan we compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with Native American casinos in Michigan. In Atlantic City, New Jersey we compete with other Atlantic City casinos as well as casinos in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In Washington, D.C. we compete with other Maryland casinos as well as casinos in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Biloxi and Tunica, Mississippi we compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi and with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas.
 
MGM China. The three primary customer segments in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer VIP players various services, such as extension of credit as well as complimentary hotel, food and beverage services. Gaming promoters operate VIP gaming rooms within the property. In exchange for their services, gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. These clientele are acquired through our direct marketing efforts. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor segment exceeds the VIP segment due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. Gaming revenues from the main gaming floors have grown significantly in recent years and we believe this segment represents the most potential for sustainable growth in the future. To target premium main floor players in order to grow revenue and improve yield, we have introduced premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots, to the main floor gaming area. The amenities create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for the use of premium main floor players.  
 
Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip, with several openings having occurred during 2016 and additional openings expected during 2017.
 
We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world, including Singapore, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Russia, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and from unlicensed gaming operations in the region. 
 
Corporate and other. Much like our domestic resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience offered to guests and the location of their resorts. Aria, which we manage and own 50% through CityCenter, appeals to the upper end of each segment in the Las Vegas market and competes with our domestic casino resorts and other resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Grand Victoria, our other unconsolidated affiliate, mainly competes for customers against casino resorts in the Chicago metropolitan market.
 
Marketing 
 
Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs as discussed further below. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also important in the convention segment. We maintain websites to inform customers about our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms, make restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets. We actively utilize several social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals.

Domestic resorts. M life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a broad-based program recognizing and rewarding customer spending across many channels focusing on wallet share capture and increased loyalty through unique benefits and rewards. M life Rewards provides access to members-only events and exclusive experiences. M life Rewards is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. Members may earn points and/or Express Comps for their gaming play which can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or the front desk at participating properties. Points may also be redeemed for free slot play on participating machines. Members can utilize the M life Rewards website, www.mlife.com, to see offers, tier levels and point and Express Comps balances. In addition, we offer a complimentary magazine — M life Magazine — to highlight customers’ experiences and showcase “Moments” that members can redeem through the accumulation of Express Comps.
 
Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.

We also utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Our major Las Vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas. In connection with our marketing activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to play Shadow Creek on a complimentary basis. Marketing efforts at Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi benefit from the Fallen Oak golf course located 20 minutes north of Beau Rivage. Additionally, we use entertainment as a marketing tool. We often provide to our customers free or discounted tickets or presale opportunities as well as occasionally offering packages that include entertainment tickets with rooms and other amenities.
 
MGM China. In January 2017, MGM Macau launched M life Rewards with a focus on non-gaming rewards to cater to an increasing number of resort and leisure customers expected with the opening of the MGM Cotai property. For customers who are primarily focused on gaming, the Golden Lion Club will continue to provide benefits to a range of members from lower spending through the highest level VIP cash players. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensures that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resort provides. Both programs, M life Rewards and Golden Lion Club, which was used prior to the launch of M life Rewards, are aspirational by design and uniquely focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend. Information from the Golden Lion Club is used to analyze customer usage by segment and individual player profile. MGM Macau has invested in the leading mobile, customer relationship management and call center technologies to ensure that all customers get great experiences and rewards.
 
In addition to the M life program, MGM Macau has also created and continues to expand several luxurious private gaming salons that provide distinctive, high-end environments for the VIP players brought to the resort through gaming promoters and the in-house VIP marketing team. MGM Macau has created a variety of incentive programs to reward gaming promoters for increased business and efficiency. 
 
Technology 
 
We utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue, drive efficiency in our operations, and serve our customers more effectively. We continue to automate our IT operations to shift costs related to operation to spend on innovation. We also are implementing leading technology solutions for all MGM major lines of businesses. We utilize data and analytics to help us make timely and accurate business decisions. We have adopted cloud first strategy to use the cloud when possible to increase our agility and speed to market.
 
We continue to enhance our eCommerce platform, which is critical to the digital platforms that support our domestic portfolio of casino resorts. Our eCommerce platform provides our guests and business partners a premier digital experience where they have the ability to create an all-inclusive experience, from accommodations to dining to shows with real time recommendations provided based on the guests’ shopping experience. Available through our domestic resorts’ individual websites and our loyalty program website (www.mlife.com), the eCommerce platform gives guests the power to customize a complete itinerary from our full portfolio of experiences, all in one place. In addition, this platform also provides our contact center agents in Las Vegas a unified and integrated customer service application, allowing our agents to provide fast, efficient, and pertinent service to our guests.

Employees and Management 
 
We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees are a primary success factor in the hospitality industry. Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible. We have numerous programs, both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe our internal development programs, such as the MGM Resorts University and various leadership and management training programs, are best in class among our industry peers. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
We seek to conduct our business in an effective, socially responsible way which we regard as essential to maximizing shareholder value. Our corporate social responsibility efforts are overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors.  
 
Diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our Company’s value system, our people philosophy, our cultural life and therefore, our competitive advantage as an employer and destination of choice for our global customer base. Our diversity initiative at our resorts fosters employee engagement, individual responsibility, team collaboration, leadership competency, high performance and innovation. Our diversity initiative has been widely recognized for many years through numerous awards and accolades. 
 
Philanthropy and community engagement. Our host community and social investments are prioritized to strengthen the communities where our employees live, work and care for their families. Our community platform features three main programs: our Corporate Giving Program, our employee-funded MGM Resorts Foundation and our Employee Volunteer Program. Through these channels, we make financial and in-kind donations, contribute volunteer service and participate in civic and non-profit organizations and issues that advance the quality of life in our communities. Key investment areas include hunger relief, diversity, public education, health and wellness and environmental sustainability.
 
Environmental sustainability. We continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives in energy and water conservation, recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green building. Certain of our casino resorts in Nevada and our casino resort in Michigan were the first in each state to earn certification from Green Key, the largest international program evaluating sustainable hotel operations. We received certifications at most of our domestic resorts and Aria and Vdara at CityCenter. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio and Mandalay Bay have all received “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.  
 
In addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara, Veer and Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-Mobile Arena have all been awarded LEED® Gold certification by the Council.
 
At MGM China, we incorporate the same commitment to environmental preservation. Our efforts to improve energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and environmental stewardship have resulted in MGM China being included in the Hang Seng Sustainability Index on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and MGM Cotai, our new integrated resort scheduled to open in the second half of 2017 achieving the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving (Macau) Association.
 
The construction of MGM Springfield will further position MGM Resorts as a leader in sustainable resort operations, and by adopting innovative technologies in the design and operating practices of this resort, we are advancing our commitment to protecting our planet in new regions. 
 
Development and Leveraging Our Brand and Management Assets 
 
In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on new resorts and other developments or initiatives and repaying long-term debt. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns. 
 
We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States. We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through 
 7


strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties. 
 
MGM Springfield
 
A subsidiary of ours was awarded a casino license to build and operate MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. MGM Springfield will be developed on approximately 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield. Plans for the resort currently include a casino with approximately 3,000 slots and 100 table games including poker; a 250-room hotel; 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space; 44,000 square feet of meeting and event space; and a 3,375-space parking garage, with an expected development and construction cost of approximately $865 million, excluding capitalized interest and land related costs. Construction of MGM Springfield is expected to be completed in late 2018.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata (following the acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s ownership interest in Borgata), Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus and Beau Rivage, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights. 
Employees and Labor Relations 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 52,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically, of which 6,000 and 2,000, respectively, support the Company’s management agreements with CityCenter. In addition, we had approximately 6,000 employees at MGM Macau. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 34,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2016. No collective bargaining agreements covering sizable numbers of our employees are scheduled to expire in 2017. In 2016 and early 2017, we entered into initial collective bargaining agreements for certain employee groups at The Mirage, Bellagio, Aria, Vdara, Monte Carlo and Gold Strike Tunica. Beau Rivage is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement with a council of unions representing various hotel and food and beverage constituencies. Mandalay Bay is currently engaged in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement for two employee groups. MGM National Harbor will begin negotiating in 2017 for initial bargaining agreements with several employee groups. As of December 31, 2016, none of the employees of MGM Macau are part of a labor union and the resort is not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Licensing 
 
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.  Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located.  These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.  
 
A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. 
 8



In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. 
 
Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 
This Form 10-K and our 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “will,” “may” and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding expected market growth in Macau, our ability to generate significant cash flow and execute on ongoing and future projects, amounts we will spend in capital expenditures and investments, the opening of strategic resort developments, the estimated costs and components associated with those developments, our expectations with respect to future cash dividends on our common stock, dividends and distributions we will receive from MGM China, the Operating Partnership or CityCenter and amounts projected to be realized as deferred tax assets. The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we make. 
 
Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.
