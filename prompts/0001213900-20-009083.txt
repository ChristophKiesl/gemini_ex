Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 
Coro Global Inc. is a Nevada corporation that was originally formed on November 1, 2005 when Bio-Solutions International, Inc. (“Bio-Solutions”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with OmniMed Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bio-Solutions, OmniMed International, Inc. (“OmniMed”) and the shareholders of OmniMed. On January 17, 2006, OmniMed changed its name to MedeFile International, Inc. The Company’s business following the closing of this agreement was the sale of an Internet-enabled Personal Health Record (iPHR) system for gathering, digitizing, maintaining, accessing and sharing an individual’s medical records, and in connection therewith, providing a professional service specializing in HIPAA compliant retrieval, reproduction and release of information. Under this service, Company personnel went onsite to physicians’ offices weekly to reproduce the records requested by third parties.
 
In October 2017, the name of the Company was changed to Tech Town Holdings, Inc. to reflect a new business strategy centered on identifying and fostering new or early stage business opportunities being fueled by digital innovation.
 
Following close scrutiny of emerging business opportunities, coupled with evaluation of market trends, the Company determined that a more prudent strategy was to narrow its focus to financial technology, also known as Fintech. Effective March 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to Hash Labs Inc. and effective January 9, 2020, the Company changed its name to Coro Global Inc.
 
Products and Services
 
The Company is developing financial technology products and solutions that use distributed ledger technologies for improved security, speed, and reliability.
 
We have not yet commenced sales of any current products. We have developed or are developing the following planned products:
 
1. Coro is a global money transmitter that will allow customers to send, receive, and exchange currencies faster, cheaper and more securely. We believe Coro will be the world’s first global payment application that includes gold, which is the oldest and most trusted currency. We will offer Coro through Coro Corp., a subsidiary of Coro Global Inc., which will operate pursuant to both Federal and State money transmission regulations. Coro Corp has already registered as a money service business with the US Treasury department and is in the process of filing for multiple state money transmission licenses throughout the US. Coro Corp. is already pursuing licensure in all U.S. States. Following licensure and launch in the US, the Company will pursue money transmission licenses in foreign countries such as Mexico and Canada. Coro’s technology facilitates money transmission and exchange with faster speeds, better security, and lower costs than existing options in the marketplace. At launch Coro will provide the ability to send, receive and exchange U.S. dollars and gold. The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and gold is transparent and set by the London Bullion Market Association and the global banks that are market makers in foreign currency exchange. Coro Corp. will operate as a money transmitter under 31 CFR § 1010.100(ff)(5)(i)(A) and will not market or sell investments in gold. The initial development of Coro’s money transmission technology and mobile application functionality is now complete. Coro is now undergoing an intensive phase of integrations and testing. We anticipate commercial launch of Coro in the second quarter of 2020.

2. Financial Crime Risk Management (FCRM) platform – We believe there are currently two problems with anti-money laundering/know your customer (or AML/KYC) solutions. The first problem is that the laws and compliance regulations have increased faster than compliance officers have been able to respond. The result is a bottle-neck, slowing global financial transactions. Onboarding new clients of financial institutions is both complex and difficult. Once onboarded the ongoing monitoring of transactions for suspicious activity has become an even greater challenge. The technology industry has been rushing to provide solutions to meet compliance requirements. Unfortunately, most of the compliance solutions offered are fragmented and inefficient. Even the best solutions only excel at one element of the AML/KYC process. With this need in mind we are developing our FCRM platform, an integrated AML/KYC onboarding and transaction monitoring solution that provides an affordable and fully integrated compliance solution for compliance departments that meet the rigorous demands of government regulators, while supporting customers. We anticipate launching FCRM as a stand-alone product during late 2020.
 
Coro Money Transmitter Business
 
Coro is a mobile application that will allow customers to send and receive U.S. dollars (USD) or gold (XAU). Coro will operate on a private permissioned network which insures the highest level of security and compliance.
 
In order to use Coro customers will be required to pass an identity verification and stringent anti-money laundering/know-your customer (or AML/KYC) check, to prevent bad actors from joining and assist in ensuring regulatory compliance. Our FCRM platform will manage onboarding, screening and monitoring of Coro’s customers.
 
Coro will provide its customers with the benefits of speed, security, transparency, and ease of use, as well as the opportunity to transact in dollars or gold on the fastest DLT on the market.
 
The Company believes Coro will solve the following two important problems:
 

● | The ability to send and receive funds faster, cheaper, more securely and across borders with ease. Current fees for sending payments from one country to another are in the double digits. Coro aims to lower the price of sending and receiving money, dramatically opening up financial services to a wider audience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to use gold as money has not existed in decades. Much like physical cash is disappearing because it became inconvenient to use in modern transactions, physical gold is also not convenient for everyday transactions. We believe Coro will solve this by allowing customers to send and receive gold as money. As a registered money service business and licensed money transmitter, Coro Corp. will be required to maintain custody accounts for U.S. dollars (USD) and gold (XAU) on behalf of its customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Coro will maintain two custody accounts to facilitate the flow of funds. One custody account will be maintained by the independent vaulting custodian for storage of users’ physical gold. The Coro users’ gold will be fully insured at all times. The balance of the users’ custody account will be represented in XAU, the International Organization of Standardization’s currency code for gold. The second custody account will be a U.S. dollar account held at a FDIC insured US Bank. The balance of the U.S. dollar account will be represented in USD, the International Organization of Standardization’s currency code for U.S. dollars.
 
Customers who download the Coro app and pass the verification process will be able to:
 

● | Deposit US dollars (USD) into their Coro account. Under this process, customers fund their Coro USD account by entering their bank information in the mobile app and authorizing the transfer of the desired amount to our US banking custodian by ACH. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exchange U.S. dollars (USD) for gold (XAU). Under this process, customers are able to exchange USD into XAU at the current XAU to USD global exchange rate plus Coro’s transaction fees. Coro processes the exchange through its gold dealer and the independent gold vaulting custodian. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exchange gold (XAU) into U.S. dollars (USD). Under this process customers are able to exchange XAU into USD at the current global XAU to USD exchange rate plus, Coro’s transaction fees. Coro processes the exchange through its gold dealer and the independent gold custodian. US dollars received from the exchange are deposited back in Coro’s U.S. bank custody account held on behalf of the customer. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gold (XAU) withdrawal. From time to time customers may wish to withdraw their gold from their Coro accounts. Coro’s customers will be able to select the amount for withdrawal, subject to a minimum of 1 XAU which equals 1 troy ounce of gold, and Coro will process the withdrawal through its gold dealer, who will ship the physical gold directly to Coro’s customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | US Dollars (USD) withdrawal. From time to time customers may wish to withdraw their US dollars from their Coro account. Customers are required to connect a U.S. bank account at the time that they open their Coro account. Customers are able to transfer any or all of their US dollar funds in their Coro account back to their U.S. bank account at any time. This transfer is done by ACH and is transmitted by Coro’s U.S. bank custodian. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Coro operates as a licensed money transmitter company by allowing users of its mobile app to send and receive monetary value in two formats: U.S. dollars (USD) and physical gold.
 
Coro Process
 
The Coro platform will operate as follows:
 

● | Coro’s distributed ledger tracks and records the movements of gold and USD between the users and assures the integrity of the system. The Coro users’ gold ownership is recorded on the ledger, guaranteeing that the users’ account information is protected and always available to them and the gold vaulting custodian. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Both sender and receiver must enroll and complete an AML/KYC process to become users of the Coro app. A sender must first fund their USD account by transferring funds from their personal bank account to Coro’s custodial bank account via ACH.
 

● | To send USD, a user transmits from within the app to any other users of the Coro app. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To send gold, a user first exchanges USD held in its Coro account into gold. The user can then send gold via the mobile app to other Coro users. Coro has engaged a gold dealer to provide gold to Coro users. When users exchange USD into gold, the gold dealer delivers the purchased amount of gold to an insured gold vaulting custodian. The corresponding USD is transmitted from the Coro custodial bank account to the gold dealer. When funds are received by the gold dealer, Coro users acquire title to the asset. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Coro has arranged physical custody of the gold with an insured gold vault custodian. Coro manages administration and record keeping for transactions performed through the Coro app. Coro users and the gold vaulting custodian also have identical sets of the records so that in the event Coro were to cease operations for any reason there is clear title documentation for Coro users to arrange delivery of their gold from the gold vaulting custodian. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Coro acts as agent for the user in the purchase, sale and custody of the gold. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical gold purchased from the gold dealer and held by the gold vaulting custodian is a custodial asset for the user’s benefit in a “bailor / bailee” relationship. The Coro user (bailor) has ownership of the gold and the gold vaulting custodian (bailee) has authorized physical possession of the gold on the bailor’s behalf. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a user decides to withdraw gold, the user sends an order to the gold dealer through the Coro app and gold is shipped to the user’s residence. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a user decides to exchange gold into USD, the user sends an order to the gold dealer through the Coro app and the gold vaulting custodian moves the physical gold from the allocated gold custodial account to the gold dealer. At the same time, the gold dealer generates a USD transfer to the user via Coro’s USD custodial bank account. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Legal rights
 
Coro users will have direct ownership of their allocated gold as follows. Such gold ownership will be effected contractually through bailment with the vault custodian. Bailment is the act of placing property in the custody and control of another, by an agreement in which the holder (bailee) is responsible for the safekeeping and return of the property. In bailment law, ownership and possession of the gold are split and they merge at the moment of delivery. Coro’s users have a bailor/bailee relationship with the custodian for the storage of their physical gold. Coro users (bailors) have ownership of the gold and the gold vault custodian (bailee) has authorized possession of the gold.
 
Coro users will only buy allocated gold with direct ownership. Gold bars are allocated and identifiable for Coro users inside independent custody vault. The gold belongs to the users and is their absolute property. This is evidenced by:
 

● | Customer gold is neither an asset nor liability on Coro’s balance sheet; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The gold vaulting custody agreement is under bailment; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment of a custody fee (which has previously been decisive in proving the bailor/bailee relationship in law); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | User’s gold in custody is fully insured for theft or loss (Lloyds of London) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Full allocation of Coro users’ property is documented each day by daily reconciliation and verified by the monthly custodial audit and quarterly independent 3rd-party audit; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All transactions and users’ balances are recorded on a distributed ledger which improves accuracy, transparency and security; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Coro users can monitor the total weight of gold they own on the Coro mobile app in real time. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coro Gold Ownership
 
When a Coro customer purchases gold through the Coro mobile payment application, the Coro user becomes the legal owner of the gold. Coro instantly routes gold purchase transactions through a gold dealer. Within the Coro app, customers’ dollars are exchanged for an equivalent amount of gold at the prevailing spot rate. Coro’s spot rate is derived from the CME and the LBMA, plus Coro’s fee. Gold purchased by the customer is identified and evidenced by a serial number, or otherwise identified and evidenced with a specific identifier in accordance with the methods used by the auditors of the independent gold vaulting custodian, such as with SKUs/bar codes, and then allocated within Coro’s custody account with the independent gold vaulting custodian. The independent vaulting custodian maintains a bailment arrangement with Coro’s customers, so that the customers have direct ownership of their gold at all times. The Coro customers gold is fully insured by the vaulting custodian. The vaulting custodian will have a daily record of each customer’s gold holdings. Allocated gold is, by definition, unencumbered. In the event of Coro’s dissolution or failure, Coro’s customers would not risk becoming creditors of the company since their ownership of their gold is direct. Coro and the independent vaulting custodian maintain an inventory list of the allocated customer gold which is updated in real time and reconciled daily. The Coro user’s gold inventory will be physically counted weekly and audited by an independent auditor on a quarterly basis. The customer’s gold ownership is also recorded, confirmed and evidenced on Coro’s accounting ledger and shared with the independent vaulting custodian. Coro and the gold vaulting custodian have the right of substitution within the allocated gold. Right of substitution means that when a customer withdraws their gold, Coro and the gold vaulting custodian may choose which gold to provide the customer, thus the serial number at purchase may be different than the serial number at withdrawal. Right of substitution makes the logistics of gold storage, deposit and withdrawal more pragmatic and is the primary method used for the independent safe custody of all commodities.
Government Regulation
 
In the US, Money Transmission activities are strictly regulated both at federal level by FinCEN and at the state level by financial institution regulators. Registration with FinCEN is mandatory for all money transmitters and state regulators impose strict requirements to obtain and maintain a license to operate in their jurisdiction. In addition, state regulations covering money transmission provide enhanced protections for the consumers in case of fraud or bankruptcy and require regular examination and review of licensees’ activities.
 
Coro Corp. is registered with and regulated by FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. FinCEN regulates Coro Corp. as both a Money Services Business (MSB) and a Dealer in Precious Metal. As a regulated financial institution, Coro Corp. must assess the money laundering risk involved in its transactions, and implement an anti-money laundering program to mitigate such risk. In addition, the company must comply with recordkeeping, reporting, and transaction monitoring requirements under FinCEN regulations 
 
As a registered Money Services Business, Coro Corp. is required to be licensed in the states where it operates. Coro Corp is in the process of obtaining individual money transmission licenses state-by-state in the jurisdictions where it plans to provide its service. In addition to an application process that includes providing a detailed business plan and criminal and financial background check on all officers and controlling parties of the applying company, licensed money transmitters are subjected to strict requirements such as providing annual audited financial statements, filing quarterly reports, and maintaining at all times a minimum net worth and a surety bond approved by the Commissioner. Due to its main office being located in the State of Florida, Coro filed an initial application for Money Transmitter license (FT2) with the Florida Office of Financial Regulations on October 4, 2019 and obtained its license on March 18, 2020. Coro filed license applications for two additional states on March 12, 2020 which are currently under review by the respective state banking departments. We are also in the process of completing license applications for eight additional states.
 
The CFTC does not regulate Coro Corp. because Coro Corp. only transacts with physical gold in the spot market when buying or selling gold for its customers. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), grants the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of futures contracts, option contracts and leverage contracts, but this authority specifically does not extend to “deferred” or “forward” delivery contracts which are essentially “cash transactions providing for later delivery of the underlying commodity.”

To prevent fraud and illegal activities at Coro’s money transmission business, the Company plans to:
 

● | Ensure that no accounts for prospective Coro customers are activated until each new customer has undergone comprehensive Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering screening; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conduct routine security audits of its DLT environment; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implement other security measures, as necessary, to further support its diligence in this regard. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has hired a chief compliance officer to develop and manage the Company’s compliance program.
 
Coro Revenue Model
 
We anticipate that Coro customers will be charged (i) a 0.5% annual custody and storage fee on their XAU balances, (ii) a 0.5% fee to exchange USD for XAU or exchange XAU for USD, (iii) a 0.5% fee for sending XAU to other Coro customers and (iv) a 0.5% (plus shipping and insurance) fee to exchange XAU for delivery of physical gold. We will collect and charge such fees from Coro customers.
Coro Business Milestones
 
The Company began development of Coro’s mobile application, database, infrastructure and the associated distributed private permissioned network, in September of 2018. The Coro technology and DLT network development process included 28 design and development stages, knowns as “sprints.” To date, all 28 Coro development sprints have been accomplished. The Coro mobile application is now undergoing an aggressive quality assurance testing phase. This testing phase includes both robust functionality and security testing with third party testing experts. Coro’s distributed ledger network has already been activated with an initial 12 nodes. Testing and quality assurance are underway on the Coro mobile application and private permissioned node network. To date, the Company has paid more than $1,500,000 for the development of its private permissioned distributed ledger network and the Coro money transmission business. The Company anticipates during the second quarter of 2020, the Company will finalize testing and quality assurance in prelude to launching the Coro money transmission business. The Company anticipates that it will incur another approximately $150,000 in testing and development costs associated with preparation for commercial launch of Coro mobile application, which the Company will pay from its working capital. Following the commercial launch of Coro in late Q2 of 2020, we anticipate incurring approximately $100,000 additional costs to complete and launch the FCRM as a stand-alone product. The Company anticipates paying such expenses from its working capital.
 
The Company continues to rely upon both employees and contractors to develop and launch Coro. Coordination of the design and development has been led by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has coordinated the Company’s technology development resources and team of consultants. The Company intends to increase its technology development team during 2020, as it continues to improve the functionality and performance of Coro, post launch.
 
Hashgraph License
 
Coro is built on a new generation of distributed ledger technology (DLT) utilizing the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, (“Hashgraph”). We believe Hashgraph is superior to the current generation of DLT. Hashgraph is owned by Swirlds, Inc., (“Swirlds”). In December 2018, we entered into a software license agreement with Swirlds to license Hashgraph.
 
DLT is disrupting and transforming existing markets in multiple industries. However, we believe there are five fundamental obstacles to be overcome before distributed ledger technologies can be widely accepted and adopted across every industry and geography. These obstacles are:
 
Performance: The technology is built on Hashgraph, which provides near-perfect efficiency in bandwidth usage and consequently can process upwards of 500,000 transactions per second. To put the speed of our network in perspective its estimated that Visa’s network handles approximately 35,000 transactions per second.
 
Security: Hashgraph achieves the highest standard for security in the field of distributed consensus: asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT). Other networks that use coordinators, leaders, or communication timeouts tend to be vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against those vulnerable areas. Hashgraph is resilient to these types of attacks and achieves the theoretical limits of security. Achieving this level of security at scale is a fundamental advance in the field of distributed systems as it is the gold standard for security in this category.
 
Stability: Hashgraph relies on both technical and legal controls to ensure the stability of the networks. This system prevents forking and illegal modifications of the algorithm.
 
Regulatory Compliance: The Hashgraph technical framework includes an Opt-In Escrow Identity mechanism that gives customers a choice to bind verified identities to otherwise anonymous accounts, which is designed to provide governments with the oversight necessary to ensure regulatory compliance. This is optional, and each user will be able decide what kinds of credentials, if any, to reveal. Hashgraph intends to work with governments to provide the same level of protection in distributed public ledgers as is currently present in the financial system.

Hashgraph accomplishes being fair, fast, efficient, inexpensive, timestamped, and DoS resistant.
 
Our Hashgraph private-permissioned network provides the strongest foundation for Coro. We believe it will enable Coro to achieve unprecedented speed with fractional cost per transaction, all while maintaining bank-grade security.
 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
The Company’s target market for Coro consists of three groups: individuals, institutions and governments.
 
Initially, our marketing efforts will focus on individuals in U.S. states including Florida, Nevada and Texas, as well as states such as Utah, Wyoming, and Oklahoma where state laws recognize gold as money. Customers will have the choice of sending or receiving gold (XAU) or U.S. dollars (USD) or exchanging between the two currencies.
 
Eventually we will expand such marketing efforts to include institutional and governmental markets. Currently, the Company is analyzing key trends and related secondary information that will compliment and aid defining its market opportunities and customer needs.
 
Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the Company conducted an extensive research and discovery to set success metrics, recognize future growth initiatives, develop audience profiles, and assess the competition landscape and market conditions.
 
Under the Company’s marketing and sales strategy, the Company has taken the following steps:
 

● | Engaged highly rated and specialized branding, media, web design, and digital marketing agencies to work in synchrony with the in-house marketing team
