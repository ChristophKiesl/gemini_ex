--------+----------

Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases with significant unmet needs. Our lead product candidate, AIR001, a sodium nitrite solution for inhalation via nebulization, is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, also known as diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved systolic function. Data show there are approximately 5.7 million individuals with heart failure in the U.S. and that approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for heart failure have HFpEF.  Enrollment is ongoing in three investigator-sponsored Phase 2 studies of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF being conducted at prestigious research institutions. Positive interim results from one of those studies were published in November 2016. Additionally, positive results from a completed Phase 2 study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF were published in July 2016.  We anticipate results from one of the ongoing studies, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 2 study of AIR001 in HFpEF being conducted by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (known as the HFN) in the first quarter of 2018. 
 Previously, our vepoloxamer product candidate was in Phase 3 clinical development for treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease and Phase 2 clinical development for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but, in September 2016, after the Phase 3 study failed to achieve its primary efficacy endpoint, we made the strategic decision to discontinue clinical development of vepoloxamer and wind down all of the clinical studies of that asset. We have since limited our development of vepoloxamer to an NIH grant-funded nonclinical study in ischemic stroke in order to focus our resources on AIR001’s development. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2016, we restructured our organization to better align our workforce with our revised operating plans, which include supporting three ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 2 studies of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF and one Phase 1/2 study in patients with cystic fibrosis, as discussed in more detail below. We have reduced our full-time workforce by more than 70% since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016 to a total of six remaining positions.
 Proposed Merger with Savara and Change in Control
 In January 2017, after an extensive review of strategic alternatives and a thorough process during which our board of directors, with assistance from its strategic transactions committee consisting of independent directors, considered a multitude of factors, our board of directors unanimously approved and we entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated January 6, 2017, with Savara Inc., a privately-held, clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of serious or life-threatening rare respiratory diseases. Pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the agreement, Victoria Merger Corp., our wholly-owned subsidiary formed solely for purposes of carrying out the merger, will merge with and into Savara, with Savara surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and Savara stockholders receiving newly issued shares of our common stock in exchange for their Savara stock.  The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will result in a change in control of our company as described below. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.
 The merger agreement contemplates that, immediately following the merger, the combined company’s name will be changed from “Mast Therapeutics, Inc.” to “Savara Inc.,” the board of directors will consist of seven members, five of which will be the current directors of Savara and two of which will be independent directors designated by us, which are expected to be two of our current independent directors, and the executive officers of the combined company will be designated by Savara with Savara’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Neville, being the combined company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Savara’s Chief Financial Officer, David Lowrance, being the combined company’s Chief Financial Officer. The combined company’s pipeline would include: 
  
• | AeroVanc, an inhaled dry-powder vancomycin to treat chronic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis, which is in preparation for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molgradex, an inhaled nebulized GM-CSF to treat pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), which is currently in Phase 2/3 development; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AIR001, our lead product candidate.
--+------------------------------------

 Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, (a) each outstanding share of Savara common stock, on an as-converted basis taking into consideration all outstanding common stock, preferred stock, restricted 
 -1-


stock and all other securities convertible or exercisable for Savara common stock, will be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of our common stock equal to the exchange ratio described below; (b) each outstanding Savara stock option that has not previously been exercised will be assumed by us; and (c) each outstanding warrant to acquire Savara capital stock that has not previously been exercised will be assumed by us. 
 Under the exchange ratio formula in the merger agreement, as of immediately after the merger, but excluding the effect of certain financings (as further described in the merger agreement), the former Savara securityholders are expected to own approximately 76% of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding following the consummation of the merger (referred to as the Post-Closing Shares), and the stockholders of Mast as of immediately prior to the merger are expected to own approximately 24% of the aggregate number of Post-Closing Shares. These percentage ownership figures are estimates. The exchange ratio will be fixed prior to closing to reflect Mast’s and Savara’s capitalization as of immediately prior to the merger. In addition, to the extent our net cash at closing (as “net cash” is specifically defined in the merger agreement), is less than zero dollars, the exchange ratio may be further adjusted in a manner that would reduce the percentage of the aggregate number of Post-Closing Shares held by stockholders of Mast as of immediately prior to the merger.
 The merger agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Mast and Savara, including covenants relating to obtaining the requisite approvals of the stockholders of Mast and Savara, indemnification of directors and officers, and Mast’s and Savara’s conduct of our respective businesses between the date of signing the merger agreement and the closing of the merger. Consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of Mast and Savara. The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both Mast and Savara, and further provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Savara a termination fee of $1.8 million or Savara may be required to pay us a termination fee of $2.5 million. 
 In addition to seeking stockholder approval of the merger agreement and issuance of shares to the Savara securityholders, we will also seek stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split intended to increase the market price of our common stock above the minimum requirements of the NYSE MKT, LLC for initial listing and to provide for sufficient authorized and unissued shares for the issuance of shares to the Savara securityholders.  Subject to stockholder approval, we would implement the reverse stock split at a ratio to be mutually agreed to by us and Savara.
 Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the officers and directors of Mast entered into a voting agreement with Mast, and the officers, directors and certain affiliated stockholders of Savara entered into a voting agreement with Savara. These voting agreements place certain restrictions on the transfer of the shares of Mast and Savara held by the respective signatories thereto and include covenants as to the voting of such shares in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and against any actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Merger. 
 Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, the officers and directors of the Mast and the officers, directors and certain stockholders of Savara entered into lock-up agreements pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, not to sell or dispose of any shares of our common stock which are or will be beneficially owned by them at the closing of the merger with one third (1/3) of such shares being released from such restrictions on each of (i) the six (6) month anniversary, (ii) the eight (8) month anniversary and (ii) the ten (10) month anniversary of the effective time of the merger.
 The descriptions above of merger agreement, the voting agreements, and the lock-up agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, the forms of the voting agreements, and the forms of lock-up agreement and the amendment to the lock-up agreement that have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and are incorporated by reference in this report. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules delivered by the parties in connection with the signing of the merger agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties contained in these agreements were made as of a specified date; may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to such agreements; and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to our stockholders. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in these agreements should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts and circumstances of the Company or any other parties thereto at the time they were made and should consider the information in these agreements in conjunction with the entirety of the factual disclosure about our company in this annual report. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed after the date of these agreements, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in our public disclosures. These agreements should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with each other and other information included in this report.

AIR001
 AIR001 is a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulization. Nitrite is a direct vasodilator and can be recycled in vivo to form nitric oxide (NO) independent of the classical NO synthase (NOS) pathway. Nitrite-mediated NO formation has several beneficial effects, including dilation of blood vessels and reduction of inflammation and undesirable cell growth. Generation of NO from sodium nitrite is not dependent upon endothelial function and is enhanced in the setting of tissue hypoxia and acidosis, conditions in which NOS activity typically is depressed. In experimental models, nitrite use has demonstrated improved remodeling both in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle.  Hemodynamic effects include venodilation with reductions in right atrial pressures, pulmonary and systemic vasodilation with reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and left atrial pressures, and improved cardiac relaxation. In addition, nonclinical studies have demonstrated that nitrite can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion and decrease mitochondrial oxygen consumption through a mechanism distinct from that of NO, which may have additional effects to improve exercise tolerance in heart failure. 
 We obtained the AIR001 program through our acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2014.  Prior to the acquisition, AIR001 had been tested in more than 120 healthy volunteers and patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension in three Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2 study and was generally well-tolerated.  Data from the 29 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who enrolled in the Phase 2 study showed a trend toward improvements in hemodynamic parameters and change in exercise capacity from baseline, and AIR001 was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events. In particular, levels of methemoglobin, which diminishes oxygen carrying capacity, remained normal (< 1.5%), distinguishing AIR001 from safety concerns associated with sodium nitrite injection, a commercially-available product for the treatment of acute cyanide poisoning that contains a black box warning for life-threatening hypotension and methemoglobin formation. 
 Rationale for Development of AIR001 in HFpEF
 We are developing AIR001 for the treatment of patients with HFpEF.  Data show that approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for heart failure have HFpEF and the prevalence of HFpEF is expected to increase as the population ages. To date, no pharmacologic agents have shown convincing evidence of efficacy in HFpEF and few interventions have been observed to improve symptoms or quality of life for HFpEF patients.  
 Patients with HFpEF suffer from dyspnea and fatigue with activity, limiting exercise tolerance.  The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral oxygen utilization abnormalities.  In HFpEF patients, cardiac pressures are often normal at rest but elevated with minimal stress (exercise), creating a major barrier to treatment because interventions that reduce filling pressures during exercise also may reduce resting pressures, increasing vulnerability to hypotension.  While HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome, which may explain the failure of clinical studies testing therapies that have shown efficacy in treating HFrEF, elevation in left ventricular (LV) filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures during exercise has been a universal finding in HFpEF patients.  
 Evidence points to impaired nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) bioavailability as playing a central role in the abnormalities that limit exercise capacity in HFpEF patients.  NO-cGMP levels can be increased using direct NO donors, such as the organic nitrates. However, organic nitrates have shown several shortcomings, including the development of tolerance, greater vulnerability to hypotension in patients with HFpEF, development of “pseudo-tolerance,” where chronic venodilation leads to renal sodium retention, and increases in oxidative stress resulting in endothelial dysfunction.  Inorganic nitrite is an alternative strategy to restoring NO-cGMP levels. Notably, because generation of NO from nitrite is enhanced with tissue hypoxia and acidosis, as occur during exercise, it becomes most active at the time of greatest need for HFpEF patients.  
 Clinical Development in HFpEF
 We have supported, or currently are supporting, four investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF being conducted at prestigious research institutions.
 Completed Phase 2 Study in Patients with HFpEF
 In February 2016, we reported positive top-line results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of AIR001 in 30 patients with HFpEF referred to the catheterization laboratory for invasive exercise stress testing. Detailed results from the study were published in Circulation Research in July 2016 in an article entitled, “Inhaled Sodium Nitrite Improves Rest and Exercise Hemodynamics in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.” In the study, AIR001 showed statistically significant improvement for the pre-specified primary endpoint: change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at 20 Watts exercise after drug treatment relative to PCWP at 20 Watts exercise in the initial assessment prior to drug treatment, compared to placebo-treated patients. AIR001 also significantly lowered right atrial pressure and significantly improved pulmonary artery compliance.

Study data show that nebulized inhaled AIR001 attenuates the hemodynamic derangements of cardiac failure that occur during exercise in HFpEF patients. AIR001 was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events.
 Phase 2 Study in Patients with PH-HFpEF
 Enrollment is ongoing in an open-label Phase 2 study evaluating the effect of AIR001 delivered in a dose escalation manner on the change in cardiovascular hemodynamics in subjects with PH who undergo standard right heart catheterization. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01431313) The study plans to enroll a total of approximately 50 subjects with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Approximately 20 of the subjects will have a diagnosis of PH associated with HFpEF. Subjects receive a first dose of 45 mg of nebulized inhaled AIR001, with one subsequent escalation dosage to 90 mg approximately 60 minutes after the first dose, based on safety and tolerability. During the study, right heart/pulmonary artery hemodynamics are measured continuously, and cardiac output is measured at 15 minute intervals, as well as noninvasive systemic blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring. Changes in hemodynamics and calculated pulmonary systemic vascular resistances, as well as pulmonary artery compliance will be performed utilizing standard formulas. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from time zero and at 15, 30 and 45 minutes of nebulization. 
 Positive interim results from the study, including data on 10 of the 20 PH-HFpEF patients to be enrolled, were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in November 2016. Of the 36 subjects whose data was reviewed, 20 were diagnosed with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and on background PAH-specific therapy, 10 were diagnosed with PH-HFpEF (WHO Group 2 PH), and 6 were diagnosed with WHO Group 3 PH. In those 36 subjects, administration of nebulized inhaled AIR001 significantly decreased pulmonary, right atrial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and was most pronounced in the patients with PH-HFpEF. AIR001 administration also led to a substantial increase in pulmonary artery compliance, which was most pronounced in the patients with PH-HFpEF. AIR001 was generally well-tolerated; no significant safety concerns were identified, satisfying the primary safety outcome of the study. In addition, there were no significant decreases in peripheral oxygen saturation nor increases in methemoglobin levels above the stopping criteria of 5%.
 In the 10 patients with PH-HFpEF, AIR001 administration resulted in significant overall decreases in right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right ventricular systolic and diastolic, and pulmonary artery systolic, diastolic and mean pressures. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased by 7.5 mm Hg (95%CI: -9.0, -6.0) and 7.9 mm Hg (95%CI: -9.4, -6.3), respectively (baseline median values 18 and 34 mm Hg, respectively). There was no significant change in transpulmonary gradient and a modest but significant increase in PVR. Pulmonary artery compliance increased by 35% (+0.97 mL/mm Hg, 95%CI: +0.25, +1.68; P = 0.008). 
 Further analysis of the dose effect of AIR001 found that most hemodynamics were affected in a dose dependent manner with the exception of pulmonary artery compliance. There was a significant dose effect on right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac index decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in pulmonary artery compliance was not dose related.
 The interim data demonstrate that AIR001 can significantly lower right atrial pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures, as well as improve pulmonary artery compliance and support further study in non-Group 1 PH patients.  
 Phase 2 INDIE-HFpEF Study
 In 2016, AIR001 was selected by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (known as the HFN) for evaluation in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 2 study in approximately 100 patients with HFpEF known as the Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in HFpEF study, or the INDIE-HFpEF study. The study began in the third quarter of 2016 and patient enrollment is ongoing. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02742129) Results are expected in the first quarter of 2018. The study is being conducted with significant support from a grant awarded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are providing test materials (AIR001 and placebo), drug delivery devices (nebulizers), regulatory and technical support, and some additional financial support, as described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources,” of this report. 
 The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to evaluate the effect of AIR001 on peak exercise capacity as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).  Approximately 100 patients with a diagnosis of HFpEF will be enrolled across approximately 20 clinical centers in the United States that are part of the HFN.  The primary efficacy endpoint is the peak oxygen consumption (VO2) after four weeks of treatment with nebulized inhaled AIR001 or placebo as assessed by CPET performed at peak drug levels. Secondary objectives include (i) submaximal activity tolerance chronically, (ii) quality of life, (iii) 
 -4-


chronic filling pressures as assessed by echocardiography and natriuretic peptide levels, and/or (iv) ventilator efficiency or submaximal exercise capacity at peak drug levels, and evaluation of the safety and tolerability of AIR001.
 The HFN is an NHLBI clinical research network.  The primary goal of the HFN is to conduct multiple clinical trials to evaluate treatments and strategies to improve management of acute and chronic heart failure. The HFN provides a unique platform for collaborative research by bringing together many premier centers across North America. HFN is composed of nine Regional Coordinating Centers and their affiliated sites, whose investigators provide scientific leadership in the collaborative development of the HFN's scientific agenda. The HFN is recognized for robust enrollment in heart failure clinical trials and high scientific productivity. The goal of partnering with HFN is to accelerate research and medical innovation, and provide early results that may improve public health.
 Phase 2 INABLE-TRAINING Study
 Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF known as the Inorganic Nitrite to Amplify the Benefits and Tolerability of Exercise Training study, or the INABLE-TRAINING study. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02713126) This is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group study in approximately 68 patients with HFpEF is evaluating AIR001’s potential to improve the clinical responses to and tolerability of exercise training (ET) in individuals with HFpEF. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (baseline to12 weeks). 
 All study subjects will undergo 12 weeks of ET. Subjects will be randomized to receive nebulized inhaled AIR001 three times daily or nebulized inhaled placebo (sodium chloride) three times daily during the study period and will wear accelerometry devices to track daily physical activity at home. After 12 weeks of ET as part of standard cardiac rehabilitation, study subjects will repeat the assessment of cardiovascular function and exercise capacity as performed at study entry to assess efficacy at a final visit. 
 The INABLE-TRAINING study has 2 aims. First, to determine whether treatment with inhaled AIR001 in addition to ET for 12 weeks improves exercise capacity and hemodynamic reserve in HFpEF. Expired gas analysis, inert gas (C2H2) rebreathe, and echocardiography will be performed during rest and exercise to measure oxygen consumption (VO2), CO, and hemodynamics before and after completion of 12 weeks of ET with inhaled NO2- vs ET with inhaled placebo. Second, to determine whether treatment with inhaled AIR001 in addition to ET for 12 weeks increases daily activity levels and quality of life (QOL), and reduces symptoms of effort intolerance during ET. Tolerability of ET will be assessed by Borg perceived effort and dyspnea scores. Large and small vessel endothelial function (brachial and digital arteries) and QOL will also be assessed. Secondary endpoints include cardiac output reserve, peak exercise workload, rest and exercise hemodynamics assessed by echocardiography, Borg dyspnea and fatigue scores recorded during ET, endothelial function assessed by tonometry and brachial artery flow mediated dilation, and QOL assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
 Early Clinical Development
 Prior to our acquisition of Aires in 2014, AIR001 had been tested in more than 120 healthy volunteers and patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension in three Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2 study and was generally well-tolerated.  Early studies investigated the maximal tolerated dose and potential drug-drug interactions with sildenafil. Additionally, Aires initiated enrollment in a 90-patient Phase 2 study of AIR001 in patients with PAH, which was prematurely terminated by Aires prior to our acquisition of the company due to Aires’ capital constraints. Data from the 29 patients who had enrolled in the study showed a trend toward improvements in hemodynamic parameters and change in exercise capacity from baseline and AIR001 was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events. In particular, methemoglobin levels remained normal (< 1.5%).
 Future Development in HFpEF
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the INDIE-HFpEF study, change in aerobic capacity (peak VO2, as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), has been correlated with other measures of improved exercise function such as six minute walk distance (6MWD) and survival. Secondary measures in that study include whether AIR001 improves submaximal activity as measured by accelerometry and quality of life on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score. Further, echocardiographic measurements on chronic filling pressures and whether AIR001 improves ventilator efficiency are being measured, all of which assessments will be utilized to plan further development of AIR001 in HFpEF.
 After an informative NHLBI study, known as HF-ACTION, revealed supervised aerobic exercise showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations, mortality, and quality of life, the INABLE-TRAINING study, which is evaluating whether the combination of AIR001 and exercise training will improve exercise capacity (as measured by CPET), measures of exercise hemodynamics (measured echocardiographically) and quality of life, is expected to provide additional data to support the use of AIR001 to improve exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.

Datasets from the ongoing Phase 2 studies, if supportive of further development of AIR001 in HFpEF patients, along with the completed toxicology studies and prior AIR001 human safety data, will be adequate for an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to enter into discussion regarding a Phase 3 program in HFpEF.
 AIR001 Phase 1/2 Clinical Study in Cystic Fibrosis Patients
 An investigator-sponsored open-label Phase 1/2 study of nebulized inhaled AIR001 in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was initiated in January 2017 and is being conducted at a prestigious research institution with funding from a grant award from a non-profit organization. The study will assess safety of nebulized inhaled AIR001 administered in a dose escalation manner. The study also aims to explore the effects of AIR001 on measures of lung function, exhaled airway nitric oxide, and reduction in bacterial burden. Sodium nitrite has demonstrated in vitro antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and other airway pathogens, as well as the ability to disperse biofilms. If supportive, we believe data from this Phase 1/2 study would facilitate the design of a potential Phase 2 program to establish AIR001’s utility as an antimicrobial agent for P. aeruginosa and sensitizer to standard antibiotic therapies in CF patients. 
Vepoloxamer
 Vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188) is purified poloxamer 188, a nonionic, block copolymer comprised of a central linear chain of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked on both sides by linear hydrophilic polyoxyethylene chains. Vepoloxamer’s mechanism of action is believed to be biophysical and driven by its ability to modulate cell membrane surface tension. We acquired the vepoloxamer program through the acquisition of privately-held SynthRx, Inc. in April 2011. 
 Over the past five years, we had focused our resources primarily on the clinical development of vepoloxamer, including conducting a 388-patient Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with in sickle cell disease, known as the EPIC study, and smaller studies intended support a new drug application, or NDA, for vepoloxamer. More than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated in EPIC. We also were conducting a Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer for the treatment of heart failure in which we planned to enroll approximately 150 patients and had opened 10 study sites in the U.S. and Australia. 
 In September 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer did not achieve its primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. Additional analyses of study data indicated that further investigation of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease was not warranted. We determined to discontinue clinical development of vepoloxamer and wind down all clinical studies with this agent. 
 Vepoloxamer has demonstrated multiple pharmacologic effects that may provide clinical benefit in a wide range of diseases and conditions typically characterized by impaired microvascular blood flow and/or damaged cell membranes, but, since September 2016, we have limited our development of vepoloxamer to a nonclinical study in ischemic stroke being funded by a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). That nonclinical study is evaluating the effects of vepoloxamer in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in experimental models of embolic stroke. The study is being conducted in collaboration with leading stroke researchers at the Neuroscience Institute at Henry Ford Health System and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. 
 We do not plan to direct any additional capital toward the development of vepoloxamer during the next 12 months. We are exploring opportunities to monetize our vepoloxamer-related assets in order to focus our resources on AIR001’s development.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have, and have not made plans to establish, our own manufacturing facilities. We meet our requirements for nonclinical and clinical trial material (including manufacturing API, formulating and assembling final drug product, labeling, testing and release, packaging, storing API and finished drug product and similar activities) by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. 
 In the case of AIR001 clinical trial material, we have single-source, third-party suppliers of API and finished drug product and there are a limited number of manufacturers with the technical capabilities and desire to produce AIR001. In addition, AIR001 is a liquid formulation that is administered via nebulization and the proprietary nebulizer device currently validated for use in clinical studies of AIR001 is manufactured and supplied by a single third-party, Philips Respironics, Inc. 
 We may investigate manufacturing-related opportunities to enhance our proprietary position around AIR001, including those involving alternative drug product formulations and delivery systems.
 In the case of vepoloxamer, following the negative results from the Phase 3 clinical study, we terminated our vepoloxamer-related manufacturing and supply agreements and currently we do not have any manufacturing capabilities for vepoloxamer.

In the future, establishing supply agreements, particularly with respect to commercial manufacturing and supply, may require us to agree to substantial investment in infrastructure, minimum volume requirements, exclusivity arrangements, and/or other restrictive or potentially costly terms. Our alternatives may be limited due to the specialized nature of the technologies and methods used to manufacture our product candidates and, in the case of AIR001, the specialized and proprietary device needed for administration of our product candidate. In addition, if we seek to make certain changes to the manufacturing process, including changing our sources of API starting material, API, or finished drug product, or to the drug delivery device, we may need FDA review and approval before a change can be implemented. Among other things, the FDA may require clinical, stability or other data for any product candidate manufactured with new materials or by new manufacturers, which data will take time and is costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating this data would increase our costs and may delay completion of development of a product candidate and/or its commercial launch or, once launched, our ability to meet market demand for the product. 
 Intellectual Property
 To protect our proprietary compounds, we have implemented and will continue to pursue a multi-faceted approach that relies on a combination of patent protection, proprietary know-how, trade secrets, and data and market exclusivity. We seek to establish and protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, including those with our contract manufacturers and drug delivery device supplier. 
 In the case of AIR001, we have filed for patent protection covering various methods of therapeutic use of inorganic nitrite, including the use of inhaled inorganic nitrite for treating HFpEF. We may also seek to obtain licenses to third party patents and other rights to the extent we determine they relate to potential therapeutic uses of AIR001.  Additionally, we believe there is potential to establish exclusivity around the combination of AIR001 and its inhalation delivery system. Other medications that alter pulmonary pressures include their delivery device in their U.S. and European market labels, and are approved for use only with the specified proprietary delivery device. 
 In the case of vepoloxamer, we have an issued patent that includes claims covering composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of making certain purified forms of poloxamer 188, including vepoloxamer. United States Patent No. 9,403,941, “Poloxamer Composition Free of Long Circulating Material and Methods for Production and Uses Thereof” will expire no earlier than July 2035. In addition, we have four issued patents outside of the U.S. relating to methods of use of purified poloxamers to treat storage-lesioned compromised blood and compositions composed of purified poloxamers and storage-lesioned compromised blood. We have filed other vepoloxamer-related patent applications. However, in connection with our decision to terminate our vepoloxamer clinical development programs, we have abandoned certain of those patent applications and may choose to abandon additional vepoloxamer-related applications in the future. 
 We are aware of a substantial number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields, and we may want or determine that we need to obtain licenses to patents or other rights owned by third parties. There is a risk that third parties may allege that they have patent rights encompassing our products or methods and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued, that contain claims covering our product candidates or methods. 
 We cannot provide assurance that our pending patent applications will issue as patents, that any issued patents will provide us with significant competitive advantages, or that the validity or enforceability of any of our patents will not be challenged or, if instituted, that these challenges will not be successful. The cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of our patents could be substantial. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or methods, duplicate our technologies or methods, or design around the patented aspects of our products, technologies or methods. We can provide no assurance that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others, licenses to which might not be available to us. 
 In addition, the approval process for patent applications in different countries may differ significantly. The patent authorities in each country administer that country’s laws and regulations relating to patents independently of the laws and regulations of any other country and the patents must be sought and obtained separately, which can add substantial cost and expense. Further, a favorable outcome or approval in one country does not necessarily indicate that a favorable outcome or approval will be obtained in other countries. 
 Competition
 The industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical) are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. We may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, compliance and financial resources and experience than do we. 
 -7-


Over the longer term, our ability, independently or otherwise, to successfully manufacture, market, distribute and sell any approved products, expand their usage or bring additional new products to the marketplace will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, FDA and foreign regulatory agency approval of new products and of new indications for existing products, the efficacy and safety of our products (alone and relative to other treatment options), the degree of patent or other protection afforded to particular products, and reimbursement for use of those products. 
 Many other organizations are developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat the same diseases and conditions for which our product candidates are in development, and the success of others may render potential application of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, even prior to completion of its development. 
 We are not aware of any pharmacologic therapy of proven benefit for patients with HFpEF. Therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have thus far failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in patients with HFpEF. A couple Phase 3 studies of Novartis’ LCZ696 in patients with HFpEF are underway, with estimated completion dates of May 2019 and July 2021, respectively. We are aware of other therapies under investigation in earlier stage clinical studies for the treatment of HFpEF. We also are aware of a non-surgical medical device being studied for treatment of HFpEF patients in the U.S., which device has received CE Mark approval in the European Union. 
 Should any therapy that receives approval prior to our product candidates become entrenched in the standard of care, the need for our product candidates may be diminished and/or such competing products may be difficult to displace. However, we believe that, as with HFrEF, there will be a need for a multimodal therapy approach to treating patients with HFpEF. 
 Acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals 
 We acquired our AIR001 program through the acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2014.  Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, upon completion of the acquisition, Aires became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The merger consideration related to the acquisition consisted solely of shares of our common stock.  All of the shares issuable to former stockholders of Aires as merger consideration were issued during 2014. There are no milestone or earn-out payments under the merger agreement.  For additional information regarding the merger consideration, see “Acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals” under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.
 Acquisition of SynthRx, Inc.
 We acquired our vepoloxamer program through the acquisition of SynthRx, Inc. in April 2011. Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, upon completion of the acquisition, SynthRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.  In December 2014, we effected a roll-up of SynthRx with and into Mast Therapeutics through a short-form merger under Delaware law. 
 The merger consideration related to the 2011 acquisition of SynthRx consisted solely of shares of our common stock.  Additional payments of up to 12,478,050 shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of SynthRx may be triggered if and when the development of vepoloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children achieves certain milestones, specifically, the FDA’s acceptance for review of an NDA covering the use of vepoloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children and the approval of such NDA by the FDA. In light of the negative results of the Phase 3 study and our termination of clinical development of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease, these milestones are unlikely to be achieved and we are no longer reserving shares of our common stock for their issuance. 
 Government Regulation 
 Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the testing, manufacturing, labeling and packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. 
 We and our third-party manufacturers, distributors and CROs may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, privacy laws and import, export and customs regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of other countries.

FDA Approval Process 
 To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. 
 The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal testing performed in compliance with FDA regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an NDA after completion of pivotal clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible inspection of selected clinical sites to confirm compliance with good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements and data integrity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The clinical investigation of an investigational new drug is generally divided into three phases that typically are conducted sequentially, but may overlap. The three phases are as follows: 
  
• | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes initial clinical studies introducing an investigational new drug into humans, and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. The number of participants included in Phase 1 studies is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 studies are typically expanded trials, which may be controlled or uncontrolled (which refers to a study that does not have a control, or comparison, group). They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product approval. Phase 3 studies usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and include from several hundred to several thousand subjects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A clinical study may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA generally requires two or more Phase 3 studies to support approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical study as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot 
 -9-


be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. In addition, a clinical study may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the study as being of a particular phase. 
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal studies, to justify regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but they may be Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board, or IRB, generally must approve the clinical trial design and process for obtaining patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may continue based on access to certain data from the study at designated check points. 
 As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements. 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications, together with payment of a significant user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, controls (CMC) and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.  In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan drug designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing.
 If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. For a standard review, this goal date typically is 12 months from the date of submission of the NDA application. If the NDA application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is designated for priority review, the FDA’s goal date typically is eight (8) months from the date of NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests, or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. The NDA review process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in 
 -10-


order to secure approval of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval. Regulatory approval of products for serious or life-threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 
 If the FDA approves any of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or its API, the FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, which data will take time and is costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating this data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all. 
 We rely on third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material and we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs, should they receive regulatory approval in the future. Future FDA, state and/or foreign governmental agency inspections may identify compliance issues at these third-party facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Many of the foregoing could limit the commercial value of a product or require us to commit substantial additional resources in connection with the approval of an investigational drug. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Expedited Review Programs 
 Investigational drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs may be eligible for certain programs intended to expedite or facilitate the process for FDA review, such as the fast track and priority review designations. Fast track and priority review designations do not change the standards for FDA approval but may expedite the approval process. 
 Investigational drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the drug and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a drug with fast track designation, the FDA may consider a “rolling review” of the NDA, meaning it may agree to review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, which could expedite the FDA’s review of the NDA. Fast track designation, however, does not guarantee that the FDA will agree to a rolling review of the NDA. An investigational drug is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an NDA for a drug product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed healthcare providers, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging drug prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our 
 -11-


products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, even if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In the case of products administered in an inpatient hospital setting, a level of payment that is inadequate to cover the cost to hospitals of providing and administering our products to patients, could delay acceptance of or limit our ability to penetrate the markets for our products. 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. Sales of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will depend in part on coverage and adequate payment from third-party payors. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States, therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payor reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products.  To the extent there is no separate payment for our product(s), there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. The ACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), included a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, and revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.  Certain provisions of the ACA are not yet, or have only recently become, effective, and others have been temporarily suspended, but the ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 
 It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions federal, state, or commercial payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA requirements, several other types of state and federal laws apply and will apply to our operations. These laws include, among others, healthcare information and data privacy protection laws, transparency laws, and fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws. 
 -12-


The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly promoting their products for uses for which they were not approved and causing the submission of claims for payment for such use under federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 The federal transparency requirements under the ACA, requires certain manufacturers of drug products, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests.  Compliance with such reporting requirements may be costly.  
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.  In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities.
 Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under federal and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and healthcare program requirements.  Although compliance programs and adherence thereto may mitigate the risk of violation of and subsequent investigation and prosecution for violations of the laws described above, the risks cannot be eliminated entirely.  In addition, due to the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Government Regulation Outside the U.S. 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S., which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 -13-


To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under European Union regulatory systems, we would be required to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application, which is similar to the NDA, except that, among other things, there are country-specific document requirements. For countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses were $20.8 million in 2016, $28.3 million in 2015 and $19.4 million in 2014.  Our research and development expenses for all three years consisted primarily of costs associated with the Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease, the Phase 2 studies of vepoloxamer in heart failure and acute limb ischemia, and research-related manufacturing for vepoloxamer and AIR001. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report for more information regarding our research and development expenses. 
Employees
