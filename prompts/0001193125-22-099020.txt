ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company 
 We are a newly organized, blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (“Business Combination”), which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as target businesses. We have identified Apexigen Inc. (“Apexigen”) as our initial business combination target, and expect to schedule a special meeting of stockholders to approve the Business Combination later this year. Upon consummation of the Business Combination with Apexigen, we expect to change our name and be known as Apexigen Inc. (the “Combined Company”). 
 On February 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), including 750,000 additional units to cover over-allotments (the “Over-Allotment Units”) at $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000. Each unit consists of one share of our common stock; one warrant to purchase one-half (1/2) share of our common stock (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO and the sale of the units, we consummated the private placement (the “Initial Private Placement”) of 247,000 Private Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, with the Sponsor (the “Unit Purchase Agreements”). The Private Placement Units are substantially similar to the units, except for certain differences in the warrants included in the Private Placement Units (the “Private Placement Warrants”). Unlike the Public Warrants, if held by the original holder or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis at such time as they become exercisable, (ii) are not redeemable by us, and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until thirty (30) days following the consummation of a Business Combination. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than its initial holders or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The shares of our common stock sold as part of the units (whether they were purchased in the IPO or thereafter in the open market) are referred to herein as “Public Shares”, and the holders thereof (including our Sponsor or management team to the extent our Sponsor or members of our management purchase Public Shares in the open market, provided that the Spsonor’s and each member of our management team’s status as a “public stockholder” will only exist with respect to such Public Shares) are referred to herein as “Public Stockholders.” 
 As of February 28, 2022, we had $58,087,092 (including interest but less the funds used to pay taxes) in the trust account. 
 Our Sponsor and Our Competitive Advantages 
 Our sponsor is an affiliate of Brookline Capital Markets, a division of Arcadia Securities, LLC, which we refer to as “Brookline” in this prospectus, a boutique investment bank with experience providing capital markets and advisory services to public and private life sciences companies, blank check companies (working with management teams during the IPO process, and later in the course of their initial business combinations) and other emerging growth enterprises. 
 Brookline prides itself on its ability to finance life science companies at all stages from inception to post-IPO. In particular, Brookline has established a strong reputation for financing privately held life science companies. Over the past several years, Brookline has expanded its public investment banking team, adding resources, capabilities, and senior team members that now underpin a comprehensive suite of investment banking

 services. With the growth of its public investment banking franchise and continued success of its private placement platform, Brookline provides value-added investment banking advice, analysis, and execution for its healthcare clients at all points of clinical development and financial maturity. 
 Brookline differentiates itself through its ability to source capital from a proprietary network of high net worth individuals and family offices and traditional institutional investors. Brookline’s investor network provides its corporate clients access to a source of long-term capital from committed, patient, and fundamental investors. Over the course of its evolution, Brookline has developed a rigorous due diligence process that has directly resulted in success for its corporate clients and its investors, leading to its reputation as a “curator” of compelling life sciences investments. 
 Brookline’s public and private investment teams have completed in excess of 100 transactions, raising more than $4 billion since inception. Brookline’s senior leadership has a history of executing public and private investment banking transactions for life science clients across a variety of indications and stages of development, resulting in a distinguished track record of success. Brookline was co-founded by three colleagues with deep roots on Wall Street. The 22-person team is led by seasoned professionals each with more than 25 years of capital markets and advisory experience at some of the world’s most prominent financial institutions such as Alex. Brown, Bear Stearns, BTIG, Citi, Cowen, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Leerink and OrbiMed. 
 Brookline is led by William B. Buchanan, Jr., Scott A. Katzmann, R.L. Harris Lydon Jr. and Graham A. Powis. Prior to co-founding Brookline, Mr. Buchanan (who is the managing member of our sponsor) served as Chief Executive Officer of Lazard Capital Markets for seven years and as Head of Equity Capital Markets, Co-Head of U.S. Corporate Finance, and Member of the Commitment Committee at Lazard Frères & Co. Prior to co-founding Brookline, Mr. Katzmann, who will serve as our President and a Director, previously served as Senior Managing Director of Opus Point Partners and Managing Director of Paramount BioCapital. Prior to co-founding Brookline, Mr. Lydon, a member of our sponsor,served as Managing Director at Summer Street Partners where he specialized in private equity and venture capital healthcare investments. Prior to joining Brookline, Mr. Powis, a member of our sponsor, served as Head of BTIG’s Investment Banking Group. 
 Brookline’s investment banking and distribution teams are complemented by an equity research team that focuses on bottoms up scientific and financial analysis on companies across all areas of life sciences. 
 We are led by Dr. Samuel P. Wertheimer, Brookline’s Senior Scientific Advisor and formerly a Private Equity Partner in the private equity group at OrbiMed Advisors. Our management team has extensive experience in healthcare investing, consulting, and operating both private and public companies, as well as a broad experience in SPACs. Our independent directors possess a broad network of relationships with private businesses, large and small public company CEOs, board members and investors that we believe will significantly benefit us as we identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates, as well as following the completion of our initial business combination. We believe that the deep domain knowledge and network provided by our relationship with Brookline and our management team will create a significant proprietary flow of potential acquisition targets in the life sciences sector. 
 Since 2013, Brookline’s access to high-quality private companies sourced from venture capital firms, private and public corporate clients, investment banking partners and existing investor referrals have resulted in more than 1,000 inbound private capital raising opportunities. Of those opportunities, Brookline has conducted diligence on more than 250 potential companies which have been vetted by Brookline’s internal private capital team and a broad network of industry experts. Brookline’s highly selective process ultimately resulted in carefully curated investment opportunities for its investor network. Fewer than 2% of inbound opportunities are accepted by Brookline. 
 Brookline’s dedication to identifying high value potential investments has enabled it to maintain a strong track record of valuation growth through progressive financings for its corporate clients and for its investors.

 Over 45% of the capital raised by Brookline has been raised by investors that have invested in at least three financings. Furthermore, this strong repeat investor interest has translated into repeat corporate clients, which accounts for more than 50% of Brookline’s private capital business. 
 We believe that our management’s industry expertise, proprietary private company deal flow, along with access to a strong investor base, should enable us to complete our initial Business Combination with Apexigen. Following our initial business combination, our objective will be to implement or support the acquired company’s operating strategies in order to generate additional value for stockholders. General goals may include additional acquisitions and operational improvements. 
 The past performance of our management team, Brookline or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of success with respect to any Business Combination we may consummate. Aside from Messrs. Sturgeon and Hauslein, no members of our management team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team, Brookline or their respective affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance. 
 Large and Growing Market Opportunity 
 The life sciences sector represents an enormous market opportunity. According to a CMS (“Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services”) report released in February 2019 total healthcare spending in the United States reached nearly $3.7 trillion (or $11,172 per person) in 2018 and is expected to grow by an average of 5.5% annually between 2018 – 2027. As a share of the nation’s GDP (“Gross Domestic Product”), healthcare spending accounted for 17.7% in 2018. The CMS has estimated that the health share of GDP is expected to rise from 17.9% in 2017 to 19.4% by 2027. This growth is largely driven by demographics and scientific innovation. 
Favorable Macro Dynamics 
 Total global healthcare expenditure continued to grow due to an aging population, pervasiveness of chronic diseases, improved access to healthcare, and scientific and medical innovations. On average, according to AARP International, more than 10,000 people per day turn 65 in the United States. This is partially attributed to improved access to healthcare and general improvement of healthcare related services. As a result, global life expectancy has increased from 62 years (in 1980) to 67 years (in 2000), and to 73 years (in 2020). Between 1950 and 2020, life expectancy has increased almost 25 years. As the average age of the general population trends upward and diseases of aging become more prevalent and healthcare consumption climbs, healthcare spending will continue to increase creating a need for companies that solve unmet needs. 
Broad Target Universe Driven by Significant Scientific and Clinical Advances 
 Major scientific and clinical advances in life sciences have led to the creation of more than 10,000 life sciences companies located in the United States and Europe. Between 2010-2014 United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved 158 novel drugs. By comparison, in the last five years 220 novel drugs have been approved by FDA for a wide range of indications, a 40% increase compared to the preceding five years. In 2019 FDA approved 10 new biosimilars, which will help create competition, increase patient access, and potentially reduce the cost of important biological drug therapies. These approvals cover a variety of conditions such as cancers, genetic disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The FDA has approved multiple novel gene and cellular therapies with disease modifying benefits in multiple indications. As scientific innovation continues to expand our understanding of diseases processes we believe that an increasing number of early-stage life sciences companies will be formed generating a significant number of acquisition targets in need of access to capital in the publics markets as they create value along the development pathway. 
Life Sciences SPAC Offers a Unique Opportunity for Private Companies and Investors Alike 
 SPACs focused on life science companies currently represent only a small portion of the SPAC market (less than 10%) relative to other sectors. Of the $9.9 billion raised in the SPAC IPO market this year only 
 
3 

 approximately $170 million is focused on the life science sector as of June 30, 2020. SPACs focused on life science companies are underrepresented in relation to the number of privately held healthcare companies that eventually require access to the public capital markets. We believe there are a significant number of high-quality private life sciences companies seeking alternative routes to the public markets and also healthcare investors willing to participate in SPACs and their business combinations. 
 Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify opportunities in the life sciences sector. Through our relationship with Brookline we have extensive proprietary deal flow from our network of venture capital firms, private and public corporate clients, investment banking partners and existing investor referrals, essential in sourcing and vetting potential business combinations. Given our profile and dedicated industry approach, we anticipate that potential target businesses may also be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources. We believe that Brookline’s reputation as an elite life-science focused investment bank with relationships across the industry and a track record of raising capital for best in class companies will enable us to become an ideal partner for potential targets in our preferred sector. We intend to filter our opportunities based on the following criteria: 
 Well Situated to Act as a Standalone Public Company 
 We intend to complete a business combination with a target that is ready to operate effectively in the public markets as it relates to corporate governance and reporting policies. We believe our target will have a talented and experienced management with a history of operating successful public companies and value creation. We expect to evaluate potential targets based on the pipeline of products and the application to the broader healthcare system while exhibiting rapid growth potential in an attempt to achieve long-term value creation and risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. 
Novel Platform with potential to Exploit Macro Trends 
 We intend to complete a business combination with a target that has produced or is producing novel products or services that address unmet needs in the markets they operate in to take advantage of the current market dynamics. We are seeking targets with strategic competitive advantages that will benefit from increased awareness in the public markets. Our management team, board of directors and sponsor have extensive experience in identifying, investing in, and operating businesses that focus on anticipating and exploiting macro trends. 
 Prospective value creation for opportunities that would be fully valued as a public company, through organic or inorganic growth     
 We believe in the ability of our management team and our sponsor to lead rigorous sourcing and due diligence processes, not only utilizing Brookline’s proprietary network, but also that of the management team and board of directors. Management expects to complete a business combination with a target that we believe will be more fully valued as a public company. We intend to find attractively valued target businesses by assessing sector and company specific dynamics, capital structure, preclinical and clinical data, validating partnerships, use of proceeds, proprietary intellectual property, and total addressable markets among other factors. Leveraging of our management team’s experiences and processes, we expect to find a target that will be well received by public markets and create value for shareholders.

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to acquire a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 The rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The Company’s IPO prospectus and charter provided that the Company initially had until May 2, 2022 (the date which was 15 months after the consummation of the IPO) to complete a Business Combination. The Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before May 2, 2022, to complete a Business Combination. On March 29, 2022, the Company mailed its proxy statement with respect to a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders of record as of March 21, 2022 to be held on April 26, 2022 for purposes of considering and voting upon a proposal (the “Extension Amendment”) to amend the Company’s charter to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a Business Combination (the “Extension”) from May 2, 2022 (the date which is 15 months from the closing date of the IPO on a monthly basis up to November 2, 2022 (the date which is 21 months from the closing date of the IPO) (the “Extended Date”). The proposal is more fully described in the Company’s proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 28, 2022. The sole purpose of the Extension Amendment is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which our Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 On March 17, 2022, the Company and Apexigen entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company and Apexigen would combine, with the former equityholders of both entities holding equity in the combined public company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange (the “Surviving Company”) and with Apexigen’s existing equityholders owning a majority of the equity in the Surviving Company. It is expected that there will be a substantial rollover of equity by the existing equityholders of Apexigen. Under the BCA, the transaction values Apexigen at $205.0 million on a net-equity basis, net of exercise proceeds for Apexigen’s pre-closing options and warrants. As a result of the transaction, the combined company is expected to receive approximately $73.1 million in gross proceeds funded by approximately $58.1 million in cash held in the Company’s trust account (assuming no shareholders exercise their redemption rights at closing) and $15.0 million from a fully committed PIPE consisting of units of shares and half a warrant for one share being sold at $10.00 per unit. The PIPE includes participation from healthcare

  institutional and individual investors. In addition, concurrent with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, Apexigen and Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC (“Lincoln Park”) have entered into a committed investment agreement under which the Surviving Company would have the right to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to an aggregate of $50 million of common stock of the Surviving Company over a 24-month period. For more information regarding the BCA and related transactions, see Note 11—Subsequent Events to our Financial Statements and the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 18, 2022. 
 The Company’s IPO prospectus and charter provided that the Company initially had until May 2, 2022 (the date which was 15 months after the consummation of the IPO) to complete a Business Combination. The Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before May 2, 2022, to complete a Business Combination. The sole purpose of the Extension Amendment is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which our Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 The completion of the proposed Business Combination with Apexigen is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the BCA, including (i) completion of any required stock exchange and regulatory review, (ii) approval of the transaction by the Company’s and Apexigen’s stockholders and (iii) receipt by Apexigen of any required third-party approvals. Accordingly, no assurances can be made that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination and to consummate a Business Combination. The Company intends to hold another stockholder meeting prior to the Extended Date in order to seek stockholder approval of a potential Business Combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

• | Subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
