Item 1. Business
Our Business 
 
The Company has developed and patented vaccines used in initial clinical trials in Europe and Asia including MelCancerVac™ (MCV) for the treatment of cancer (one phase I/II trial in Denmark and two phase II trials in Denmark and Singapore). The Company has advanced candidate therapies, targeted initially at non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (sometimes referred to herein as CRC). MCV was developed by the Company in 2001.  In September 2008, the Singapore government granted to DanDrit Denmark a named-patient compassionate use program of MCV. MCV was evaluated in three single-arm Phase II clinical trials in cancer where MCV demonstrated potential efficacy. Subsequent to this, the Company was a participant to designing a randomized trial with stage IV colorectal cancer patients.
 
Our only product is MCV and currently there is no ability to market MCV other than the Singapore compassionate use program and the MyTomorrows compassionate use program.
 
Our current strategy is focused on conducting clinical trials in advanced colorectal cancer. Our clinical development strategy is to continue our research and development of MCV including but not limited to a randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial to determine the ability of MCV to prevent recidivism in stage IV colorectal patients with no evidence of disease (NED) after resection of metastasis and chemotherapy. 
 
Recent Developments
 
On April 21, 2017, the Company engaged a consultant to improve the efficacy of the Company’s vaccine protocol MCV. The compensation to the consultant was $75,000 plus 200,000 common shares of the Company’s stock valued at $490,000.
 
On April 21, 2017, the Company engaged a consultant to improve the efficacy of the Company’s vaccine protocol MCV. The compensation to the consultant was $5,000 per month plus 100,000 warrants to purchase common shares at $1.30 per share expiring April 21, 2022 valued at $115,754.
 
In July 2017, DanDrit USA executed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of a biotechnology company with certain intellectual property rights in the field of HIV. The Company is currently undergoing due diligence on the target entity.
 
Our Intellectual Property  
 
The Company filed its first Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application on November 29, 2002 with priority claimed from 2001 with the Danish application, shortly after our formation.
 
The Company may continue to patent its innovations, such as novel dendritic cell production systems or dendritic cell quality control. To support potential income streams the Company may patent non-core applications of its dendritic cell technologies so as to secure future revenue streams from out-licensing activity.

● | Protocol for generating dendritic cells (2005 DK, 2008 PCT) 
 | This patent covers the generation of dendritic cells based on a blood sample of 200 ml. The patent differs from other DC generating patents by the utilization of reduced temperature and a single blood sample. DC’s exposed to tumor antigens followed by treatment with T(h)1-polarizing differentiation signals have paved the way for the development of DC-based cancer vaccines. Critical parameters for generation of optimal functional clinical grade DC’s are a very competitive area. The Company has developed a method that covers the generation of immature dendritic cells under reduced temperature settings which by further activation has been shown to give a high yield of homogeneous and fully matured DC’s. This patent was filed on December 7, 2006. In the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) a large majority of claims were found to be novel and inventive. The patent expiry date is 2032. This patent was granted in 2012 in China, Eurasia, Russia, Europe, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that the Company uses to generate dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without the Company’s consent. These patent rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. 


● | Method for generating tolerogenic dendritic cells employing decreased temperature (2007) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | The Company has expanded the method of development of mature dendritic cells to also include the generation of regulatory DC’s. In addition to DC’s used for cancer immunotherapy, The Company has developed an additional arm of DC’s, namely regulatory/tolerogenic DC’s to be used for treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and Multiple Sclerosis. This patent was filed on November 13, 2008. Patent pending: worldwide. 1st Office Action received in Europe August 25, 2010. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that the Company uses to produce tolerogenic dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without the Company’s consent. These patent rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. 


● | Micro RNAs as markers of the functional state of a dendritic cell 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | This patent covers and demonstrates that functionally different DC’s carry unique microRNA signatures. By examining a handful of microRNA profiles one can analyze the function of DC vaccines. We believe this is a valuable addition to other vaccine quality control measures that are currently used in studies that involve DC’s. Critical parameters for assessment of the optimal functional state of DC’s and prediction of the vaccine potency of activated DC’s have in the past been based on measurements of differentiation surface markers like HLA-DR, CD80, CD83, CD86, and CCR7 and the level of secreted cytokines like interleukin-12p70. However, the level of these markers does not provide a complete picture of the DC phenotype and may be insufficient for prediction of clinical outcome for DC-based therapy. We have identified additional biomarkers by investigating the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mature DC’s relative to immature DC’s. The patent was filed on November 14, 2008. In the International Preliminary Report on Patentability, a large majority of claims were found to be novel and inventive. Patent pending: Europe and USA. 1st Office Action received in Europe on August 18, 2010. Follow up action on election restriction received in the USA on October 21, 2010. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that the Company uses to test and release its dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without the Company’s consent. These patent rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement.

Industry
 
Our lead products for NSCLC (17.35%) and CRC (8.25%) address 25.6% of all cancer deaths.
 
Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases in 2012 (source Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, Dikshit R, Eser S, Mathers C et al. GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.0, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC Cancer Base No. 11). The number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades. Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015. Globally, nearly 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer (source: World Health Organization). The economic impact of cancer is significant and is increasing. The total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was estimated at approximately $1.16 trillion (source: Stewart BW, Wild CP, editors, World Cancer Report 2014).
 
The per-treatment price of chemotherapy for CRC in the United States is approximately $30,000. We expect that, if our vaccine is approved for use in CRC patients, the cost per-treatment will be approximately equal to the per-treatment cost of chemotherapy.

Governmental Regulation 
 
 MCV and any future product candidates that we will be developing will require approval of the FDA before they can be marketed in the U.S. Although our focus at this time is primarily on the U.S. market, in the future similar approvals will need to be obtained from foreign regulatory agencies before we can market our current and proposed product candidates in other countries.
 
The process for filing and obtaining FDA approval to market therapeutic products is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. The historical failure rate for companies seeking to obtain FDA approval of therapeutic products is high and, with the exception of Dendreon Corp.’s dendritic cell vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer, no cancer stem cell or dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine has to date been approved by the FDA. This process includes conducting extensive pre-clinical research and clinical testing, which may take longer and cost more than we initially anticipate due to numerous factors, including without limitation, difficulty in securing appropriate centers to conduct trials, difficulty in enrolling patients in conformity with required protocols in a timely manner, unexpected adverse reactions by patients in the trials to our proposed product candidates and changes in the FDA’s requirements for our testing during the course of that testing.
 
The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but often can exceed five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product and other factors. Any analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to a variety of reasons, including new government regulations from future legislation or administrative actions or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review.
 
Any delay or failure in our clinical trial program and in obtaining required approvals would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the product.
 
Environmental Matters 
 
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with applicable environmental requirements at all of our facilities. We are also subject to laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries.
Research and Development 

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial costs related to manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract research and development costs, and compensation costs. 
 
Discovery and preclinical research and development expenses include costs for substantial external scientific personnel, technical and regulatory advisers, and others, costs of laboratory supplies used in our internal research and development projects, travel, regulatory compliance, and expenditures for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we are actively engaged in clinical trials. Because we are pre-revenue company, we do not allocate research and development costs on a project basis. We adopted this policy, in part, due to the unreasonable cost burden associated with accounting at such a level of detail and our limited number of financial and personnel resources.
 
Expenses for Company-sponsored research and development for the year ended June 30, 2017 and year ended June 30, 2016 were $62,763 and $804,188, respectively.

Competition 
 
There is extensive competition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the technology is developing rapidly. If newly developed products of our competitors are more efficient, cheaper, more patient-friendly, safer, or better placed than the Company’s vaccine candidates, or if the Company’s competitors develop drugs that reduce or eliminate the need for the Company’s vaccine candidates, such competition could reduce or eliminate the Company’s commercial opportunities. Many of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than DanDrit and significantly more experience than DanDrit with preclinical and clinical research and development and in obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products.
 
The Company’s drugs may face competition as a result of many factors, including the route of administration (e.g. oral administration vs. injection), the availability and cost of production, efficiency of the Company’s partners’ marketing and sales efforts as well as the price of the Company’s products. DanDrit has limited or no previous experience in these areas. The Company’s inability to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on the Company’ business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities. At this time, the Company does not represent a significant presence in the biopharmaceutical industry.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has 3 full-time employees.
 
Facilities and Offices  
 
The Company’s corporate headquarters are located at Stumpedyssevej 17, 2970 Hørsholm, Denmark. We lease approximately 1,108 square feet at our Symbion location which is used for work and storage of cells and biological material in freezers, and the lease terminates on September 30, 2017. The Company has an office in New York which is a virtual office space that can be terminated by the Company with one month’s notice.
Corporate History 
 
DanDrit USA was originally incorporated in Delaware on January 18, 2011 under the name “Putnam Hills Corp.” as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. We filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on August 12, 2011.
   
On February 12, 2014, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Share Exchange Agreement, we completed the acquisition of approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark and as a result became DanDrit Denmark’s parent company. In connection with this Share Exchange, each outstanding share of common stock of DanDrit Denmark was exchanged for 1.498842 shares of DanDrit USA’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”) for an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares, including 185,053 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance, in accordance with Section 70 of the Danish Companies Act and the Articles of Association of DanDrit Denmark, to the DanDrit Denmark stockholders who did not consent to the Share Exchange and deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes. In addition, in connection with the Share Exchange (1) the sole stockholder prior to the Share Exchange agreed to cancel 4,400,000 shares of outstanding Common Stock owned by it and (2) the board of directors and executive management of DanDrit Denmark were appointed to serve as the Board of Directors and executive management of DanDrit USA, respectively, effective upon the resignation of the sole officer and director of DanDrit USA prior to the closing of the Share Exchange.
 
In June 2015, DanDrit USA’s Board of Directors, or the Board, approved a change to its fiscal year end from December 31 to June 30.

Emerging Growth Company 
 
 As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An “emerging growth company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced disclosure of financial information in this prospectus, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 Each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur on June 30, 2019 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; provided, however, that an emerging growth company may elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have not elected to opt out of the transition period.
 
Because we have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
