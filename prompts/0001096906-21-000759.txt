ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
Our Business
 
Company Background and History
 
Alpine 4 Holdings, Inc (formerly Alpine 4 Technologies, Ltd) (“we”, “our”, “Alpine 4”, the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 22, 2014. We are a publicly traded conglomerate that is acquiring businesses that fit into our disruptive DSF business model of Drivers, Stabilizers, and Facilitators. At Alpine 4, we understand the nature of how technology and innovation can accentuate a business. Our focus is on how the adaptation of new technologies even in brick and mortar businesses can drive innovation. We also believe that our holdings should benefit synergistically from each other and that the ability to have collaboration across varying industries can spawn new ideas and create fertile ground for competitive advantages. This unique perspective has culminated in the development of our Blockchain-enabled Enterprise Business Operating System called SPECTRUMebos. 
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company was a holding company that owned nine operating subsidiaries:
 
-
A4 Corporate Services, LLC; 
 -
ALTIA, LLC; 
 -
Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc.; 
 -
Morris Sheet Metal, Corp; 
 -
JTD Spiral, Inc.; 
 -
Excel Construction Services, LLC; 
 -
SPECTRUMebos, Inc.; 
 -
Impossible Aerospace, Inc.; and 
 -
Vayu (US), Inc. 
 In the first quarter of 2020, we also created three additional subsidiaries to act as silo holding companies, organized by industries. 
These silo subsidiaries are A4 Construction Services, Inc. (“A4 Construction”), A4 Manufacturing, Inc. (“A4 Manufacturing”), and A4 Technologies, Inc. (“A4 Technologies”). In the first quarter of 2021, we formed additional silo subsidiaries: A4 Defense Systems, Inc. (“A4 Defense”); and A4 Aerospace Corporation. All of these are Delaware corporations. Each is authorized to issue 1,500 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, and the Company is the sole shareholder of each of these subsidiaries. 
 
In March 2021, the Company announced the combination of its subsidiaries Deluxe Sheet Metal, Inc. (Deluxe) and Morris Sheet Metal Corporation (Morris) to become one of the largest sheet metal contractors in the Midwest region 

5

of the United States. Both companies will be under the Morris Sheet Metal brand. Management anticipates that Deluxe and Morris will be fully integrated by May 2021. The Company’s management believes that the combination of these businesses will create a more harmonious relationship between the two companies. The combining of resources should empower Morris to strengthen its brand through its strategic banking relationship, eliminate duplicative and competitive interests, and expand its footprint beyond the Indiana home base.

Who We Are
 Alexander Hamilton in his “Federalist paper #11”, said that our adventurous spirit distinguishes the commercial character of America.  Hamilton knew that our freedom to be creative gave American businesses a competitive advantage over the rest of the world.   We believe that Alpine 4 also exemplifies this spirit in our subsidiaries and that our greatest competitive advantage is our highly diverse business structure combined with a culture of collaboration.
 It is our mandate to grow Alpine 4 into a leading, multi-faceted holding company with diverse subsidiary holdings with products and services that not only benefit from one another as a whole, but also have the benefit of independence. This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings.  The essence of our business model is based around acquiring B2B companies in a broad spectrum of industries via our acquisition strategy of DSF (Drivers, Stabilizer, Facilitator).  Our DSF business model (which is discussed further below) offers our shareholders an opportunity to own small-cap businesses that hold defensible positions in their individual market space.  Further, Alpine 4’s greatest opportunity for growth exists in the smaller to middle-market operating companies with revenues between $5 to $150 million annually. In this target-rich environment, businesses generally sell at more reasonable multiples, presenting greater opportunities for operational and strategic improvements that have greater potential to enhance profit.    
 Driver, Stabilizer, Facilitator (DSF) 
 Driver: A Driver is a company that is in an emerging market or technology, that has enormous upside potential for revenue and profits, with a significant market opportunity to access. These types of acquisitions are typically small, brand new companies that need a structure to support their growth. 
 Stabilizer: Stabilizers are companies that have sticky customers, consistent revenue and provide solid net profit returns to Alpine 4. 
 Facilitators: Facilitators are our “secret sauce”. Facilitators are companies that provide a product or service that an Alpine 4 sister company can use as leverage to create a competitive advantage. 
 When you blend these categories into a longer-term view of the business landscape, you can then begin to see the value-driving force that makes this a truly purposeful and powerful business model.  As stated earlier, our greatest competitive advantage is our highly diversified business structure combined with a collaborative business culture, that helps drive out competition in our markets by bringing; resources, planning, technology and capacity that our competitors simply don’t have.  DSF reshapes the environment each subsidiary operates in by sharing and exploiting the resources each company has, thus giving them a competitive advantage that their peers don’t have.

How We Do It:
 Optimization vs. Asset Producing 
 The process to purchase a perspective company can be long and arduous.  During our due diligence period, we are validating and determining three major points, not just the historical record of the company we are buying.  Those three major points are what we call the “What is, What Should Be and What Will Be”.  
 ·
“The What Is” (TWI). TWI is the defining point of where a company is holistically in a myriad of metrics; Sales, Finance, Ease of Operations, Ownership and Customer Relations to name a few. Subsequently, this is usually the point where most acquirers stop in their due diligence.  We look to define this position not just from a number’s standpoint, but also how does this perspective map out to a larger picture of culture and business environment. 
 ·
“The What Should Be” (TWSB).  TWSB is the validation point of inflection where we use many data inputs to assess if TWI is out of the norm with competitors, and does that data show the potential for improvement. 
 ·
“The What Will Be” (TWWB).  TWWB is how we seek to identify the net results or what we call Kinetic Profit (KP) between the TWI and TWSB.  The keywords are Kinetic Profit.  KP is the profit waiting to be achieved by some form of action or as we call it, the Optimization Phase of acquiring a new company. 
 Optimization:  During the Optimization Phase, we seek to root up employees with in-depth training on various topics.  Usually, these training sessions include; Profit and Expense Control, Production Planning, Breakeven Analysis and Profit Engineering to name a few.  But the end game is to guide these companies to: become net profitable with the new debt burden placed on them post-acquisition, mitigate the loss of sales due to acquisition attrition (we typically plan on 10% of our customers leaving simply due to old ownership not being involved in the company any longer), potential replacement of employees that no longer wish to be employed post-acquisition and other ancillary issues that may arise.  The Optimization Phase usually takes 12-18 months post-acquisition and a company can fall back into Optimization if it is stagnant or regresses in its training.  
 
Asset Producing:  Asset Producing is the ideal point where we want our subsidiaries to be.  To become Asset Producing, subsidiary management must have completed prescribed training formats, proven they understand the key performance indicators that run their respective departments and finally, the subsidiaries they manage must have posted a net profit for 3 consecutive months.
 
Diversification 
 
It is our goal to help drive Alpine 4 into a leading, multi-faceted holding company with diverse products and services that not only benefit from one another as whole but also have the benefit of independence. This type of corporate 

7

structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership, while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings. Alpine 4 has been set up with a holding company model, with Presidents who will run each subsidiary business, and Managers with specific industry related experience who, along with Kent Wilson, the CEO of Alpine 4, will help guide our portfolio of companies as needed. Alpine 4 will work with our Presidents and Managers to ensure that our core principles of Synergy, Innovation, Drive, Excellence are implemented and internalized. Further, we plan to work with our subsidiaries and capital partners to provide the proper capital allocation and to work to make sure each business is executing at high levels. 
 
In 2016, we saw the beginning of our plan for diversification take hold with the acquisition of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. (“QCA”), when Alpine 4 acquired 100% of QCA’s stock effective April 1, 2016. Additional information relating to our acquisition of QCA can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.
 
In October 2016, we formed a new Limited Liability Company called ALTIA (Automotive Logic & Technology In Action) to create an independent subsidiary for Alpine 4’s 6th Sense Auto product and its BrakeActive product.
 
In April 2018, we acquired 100% of American Precision Fabricators (APF) Additional information relating to our acquisition of APF can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2018.
 
Effective January 1, 2019, we purchased Morris Sheet Metal Corp., an Indiana corporation, JTD Spiral, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of MSM, an Indiana corporation, Morris Enterprises LLC, an Indiana limited liability company and Morris Transportation LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (collectively “Morris”).
 
On November 6, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Deluxe Sheet Metal, Inc., an Indiana corporation (“DSMI”), DSM Holding, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (“DHL”), and the real estate assets of Lonewolf Enterprises, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (“LWE,” and collectively with DSMI and DHL, “DSM”).
 
On February 21, 2020, the Company, through its holding subsidiary A4 Construction, completed the acquisition of Excel Fabrication, LLC, an Idaho Limited Liability Company (“EFL”). EFL subsequently changed its name to Excel Construction Services, LLC.
 
On November 13, 2020, the Company and a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company named ALPP Acquisition Corporation 1, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub 1”), entered into a merger agreement (the “IA Agreement”) with Impossible Aerospace Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“IAC”), pursuant to which IAC merged with and into Merger Sub 1 (the “IA Merger”). On November 12, 2020, the Company created Merger Sub 1 and became its sole shareholder. Merger Sub 1 was created solely for the purpose of the IA Merger. The IA Merger closed on December 15, 2020.
 
On December 29, 2020, the Company and a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company named ALPP Acquisition Corporation 2, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub 2”), entered into a merger agreement (the “Vayu Agreement”) with Vayu (US), Inc., a Delaware corporation (“VAYU”), pursuant to which VAYU merged with and into Merger Sub 2 (the “Vayu Merger”). On December 29, 2020, the Company created Merger Sub 2 and became its sole shareholder. Merger Sub 2 was created solely for the purpose of the Vayu Merger. The Vayu Merger closed on February 8, 2021.
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company was exploring additional acquisition and merger transactions, and additional information will be provided if and when such transactions are closed.
 
At the core of our business strategy is our focus on scalable corporate platform solutions. We have built a strong portfolio of manufacturing, software, and energy driven businesses with a focus on long-term value creation.
