The Company is the originator of a new “Delicatessen” concept called “Your Hometown Deli.” Your Hometown Delis features “home-style” sandwiches, food items, and groceries in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Your Hometown Delis are designed to be comfortable community gathering places for customers of all ages. The Company seeks to create an establishment that will appeal to local residents and commuting workers, conveniently offering high-quality products at fair prices. Targeted towards smaller towns and communities, the Company’s first and only location was opened in Paulsboro, New Jersey on October 14, 2015.
 
We have limited advertising using social media and direct mailing to residents in towns around our store, however, we continue to place advertisements in a local high school sports calendar, local newspaper and have attended various local events with food samples and menus. Events like the Lighthouse Challenge held at Tinicum Rear Range Lighthouse and various political fundraisers throughout Gloucester County. We expect our losses to continue during 2021.
 
Going forward, we intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of Directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities. We have no particular business combination in mind and have not entered into any negotiations regarding such a combination. Neither our officers nor any of our affiliates has engaged in any negotiations with any representative of any company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or combination between our company and such other company. We have not yet entered into any agreement, nor do we have any commitment or understanding to enter into or become engaged in a transaction.
 
We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is a business analyst. Therefore, it is anticipated that outside consultants or advisors may be utilized to assist us in the search for and analysis of qualified target companies.
 
Recent Developments
 
Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
 
On March 23, 2020, we were forced to temporarily close the delicatessen due to the stay-at-home order issued by the Governor of New Jersey on March 9, 2020, resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19. The delicatessen was re-opened on September 8, 2020, with a “soft opening” to a limited audience, prior to its “Grand Re-Opening” to the public on September 22, 2020. The temporarily closure and other effects of COVID-19 had a material impact on our business during 2020. Although we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact, it is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to effect the flow of customers into the deli throughout 2021.  Those customers include commuting workers, local students and coaches who frequent the sports facility on the property and the reduced number of people willing to dine outside the household.
Corporate Developments 
 
On April 14, 2020, the Company consummated a private offer and sale of an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of common stock for gross cash proceeds to us of $2,500,000.

The Your Hometown Deli Concept
 
Your Hometown Deli is a delicatessen concept that will focus on providing high-quality food products not available in local supermarkets or take-out restaurants. The delicatessen concept has a worldwide history with the term first appearing in the English language in 1889. The word “delicatessen” originates in the German language and means “delicacies” or “fine foods.” Delicatessens vary throughout the world, but in the United States a delicatessen (or “deli”) is a small retail store that is a blend of a grocery and a fast-food restaurant.
 
The Company’s Your Hometown Deli concept is patterned after traditional delicatessens, offering a wider and fresher menu than found at fast-food restaurants. Sandwiches and green salads are made fresh to order. Like many delis, Your Hometown Deli serves some hot foods kept on a steam table, similar to a cafeteria. In addition to ready-to-eat food, the Your Hometown Deli sells cold cuts by weight. A wide variety of beverages are also sold together with potato chips and similar products.
 
In addition to our food offering, newspapers, limited household items and small snack items, such as candy, cookies and chewing gums are planned to be available for purchase. Your Hometown Deli also provides take-out service and limited seating in the store.
 
We have begun generating revenue from the sales of our food and beverage since our soft opening in mid-October 2015. Besides the equipment, fixtures, and inventories we purchased for our deli store, we have limited assets. We had minimal working capital as of the date of this annual report and used cash in operating activities for the year then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Products 
 
Your Hometown Deli provides sandwiches, soups, salads, deli meats/cheeses, hot/cold drinks, fresh breads/rolls and small retail items for cooking, baking, and home use. Salads include made-to-order green salads, prepared pasta, potato, chicken, or other variety of “wet” salads. Breakfast products include baked goods (breakfast pastries, bagels, toast), yogurt, and hot breakfast sandwiches. Fresh coffee, tea and other hot and cold beverages are also available for purchase. 
Strategy

The Company’s business strategy is to create a food-centered social environment within the local community that offers higher-quality prepared food and ingredients than is typically found locally. The Company’s management believes that broader market trends and certain locality-specific attributes support this strategy. The average American eats out 4-5 times a week and according to the United States Department of Labor. Management of the Company believes the increased popularity of eating out in the United States is a social trend that is likely to continue in the future.
 
Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our company. If we cannot obtain financing or if we determine not to proceed with our business plan, we may decide to exit our existing business and explore potential strategic alternatives, including establishing a new business, or target an existing business for acquisition, without restriction to any specific business, industry or geographical location.
 
Location
 
The Company’s sole location is in Paulsboro, a borough in Gloucester County, New Jersey that was founded in 1904. Paulsboro is located directly across the Delaware River from the city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia airport. Your Hometown Deli is located on a property in the commercial area of downtown Paulsboro that has two buildings. The front building is the location of the new Your Hometown Deli as well as the local Conrail offices. The rear building is used throughout the week as a practice facility by the local wrestling club and other sports groups. Paulsboro has a national reputation for its wrestling activities and one of the Company’s founders is a leader in the sport of wrestling.
 
The borough of Paulsboro is undergoing a redevelopment phase from a petroleum products specialty port into an adaptable “OmniPort” able to handle a diversity of bulk, break bulk cargo and shipping containers. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that the port is well suited to become a center for the manufacturing, assembly, and transport of wind turbines and platforms for the development of Atlantic Wind Connection. The port is located approximately one mile from the site of the Your Hometown Deli. The Company’s management believes that hundreds of employees around the area will eventually pass the Your Hometown Deli, the only food establishment on the main commuter route to the Port.

The Market
 
The local Paulsboro market is small, but conducive to hosting a Your Hometown Deli. According to the NJ Gazetteer, there were 5862 people and 2198 households residing in the borough as of July 1, 2020. The median household income was $44,250. The broader Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area is the eight-largest metropolitan area in the United States with a population to 6.1 million people.
 
The Company anticipates drawing customers from people living in Paulsboro and the adjacent communities of Greenwich, Clarksboro, and West Deptford, New Jersey. Commuting workers are also anticipated to be customers.
 
Local students and coaches who frequently use the sports practice facility on the property are another group of potential customers. The practice facility is also home to the “The Monster Factory,” a professional wrestling training and wrestling match promotions organization. In business more than 30 years, the Monster Factory has become “the world’s most famous wrestling school” and has been featured in the Rolling Stone, NewsWeek, and Wall Street Journal. The Company believes that the attendees of Monster Factory wrestling events are potential customers for Your Hometown Deli.
 
Local competing delicatessen concept stores include Wawa and Royal Farms. Other dining and grocery options in the area include locally owned pizzerias, seafood, and fine dining restaurants. Fast food options in the vicinity include McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Grocery stores include Dollar General, Heritage’s Dairy Stores and Save A Lot.
 
Employees
 
The Company presently has no full-time employees apart from its officers and directors, Paul F. Morina, President, and Christine T. Lindenmuth. Both are currently working for the Company without any compensation.
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company relies heavily on word of mouth for its marketing. The Company’s founders have close ties to the community in which the first store is located and believe that these relationships will help the Company’s sales and marketing efforts. We use Facebook to describe the quality, atmosphere, products, specials, customer opinions and general information about the Your Hometown Deli’s operation. All sales and marketing messages will attempt to describe the unique character of the Your Hometown Deli and its family-oriented style and old-world feel.

Our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.
