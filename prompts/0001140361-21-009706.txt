Overview
 
We are a leading provider of cloud-based software and integrated payment processing solutions that simplify and automate B2B commerce. Accounts receivable (“AR”) is broken and relies on conventional processes that are outdated, inefficient, manual and largely paper-based. We are at the forefront of the digital transformation of AR, providing mission-critical solutions that span credit decisioning and monitoring, online ordering, invoicing, cash application and collections. Our solutions integrate with a number of ecosystem players, including financial institutions, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, and accounts payable (“AP”) software platforms, to help customers accelerate cash flow and generate sales more quickly and efficiently. Customers use our platform to transition from expensive paper invoicing and check acceptance to efficient electronic billing and payments, which accelerates revenue capture, generates cost savings, and provides a better user experience.
 
We help reduce the complexity of B2B commerce. Our customers struggle to achieve their digital transformation goals: paper invoicing is widespread; many ERP systems have little to no electronic invoicing and payment capabilities; suppliers may not accept electronic payments due to cost or quality of remittance and applying cash is time consuming and expensive. According to a 2019 Billentis report, there are over 280 billion annual invoices globally, but a significant proportion of B2B payments are still made by paper check. As we drive electronic invoice adoption, there is a significant opportunity to monetize electronic payments, which further expands our network in a virtuous cycle. According to Visa Inc.’s 2019 annual report, there is over $120 trillion of global B2B payment volume, and, according to a 2018 MasterCard report, over 50% of B2B payments are still made by paper check. Compounding this problem, there has been a proliferation of AP software providers focused on enrolling suppliers in their network, which forces suppliers to post invoices into multiple AP portals. In addition, AP software providers are promoting acceptance of electronic payments, including single-use virtual cards, which has added stress and complexity to supplier AR systems.
 
Our proprietary technology platform offers customers multiple ways to present invoices (online, email, AP portal, and print/mail) and receive payments (credit card, ACH, email, phone and paper check). We have an electronic solutions (“eSolutions”) team that works closely with our customers to transition their users from paper invoices and payments to electronic, which results in accelerated savings, faster realization of cash, and a better user experience. In turn, we benefit from margin expansion and incremental revenue through the monetization of electronic payments. Furthermore, our customers have a daunting task of capturing and applying payments from hundreds or thousands of their buyer customers, all via different channels and payment types.
 
In 2017, we created the Business Payments Network (“BPN”), which is a powerful network that connects buyers, suppliers, and financial institutions to simplify and streamline the process of accepting electronic payments. The BPN has built-in integrations with leading ERP and accounting systems, AP software providers, payment card issuers and payment acceptance networks. The BPN offers an online supplier business directory, programmatic payment preferences, payment acceptance flexibility and streamlined reconciliation of remittance data.
 
As of December 31, 2020, over 1,800 enterprise and middle market customers trust our platform to manage their AR operations and process payments. We have customers across diversified industry verticals, including technology, healthcare, industrial, wholesale distribution, consumer packaged goods and others. Our customers include many of the largest Fortune 500 companies, as well as high-growth Fortune 1,000 and middle market businesses. Generally, our customers are in high-bill volume industries with complex billing needs, including those with a diverse customer base, multiple distribution channels and numerous product SKUs. Our technology, distribution and support are configured to the specific billing and payment needs of customers in these verticals.
 
Our go-to-market strategy is highly targeted, including market-directed demand generation strategies and a direct sales organization. We acquire customers through targeted account-based marketing, content-rich marketing campaigns and referrals from channel partners and customers. Our target customers are enterprise and middle market B2B businesses with at least $50 million in annual revenue. As of December 31, 2020, our channel partners included several of the largest financial institutions in the United States, including J.P. Morgan Chase, as well as a growing network of referral and reseller partners. We make our software accessible by integrating with leading ERP systems and accounting system vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Epicor, Microsoft, and Sage. In addition to financial institutions, we have strategic relationships across the BPN, most notably Visa Inc. (“Visa”), as well as strategic relationships with AP software providers, including AvidXchange, FIS, Comdata and Finexio.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 56% of our total revenue and 75% of our net revenue (non-GAAP) from a combination of software and payments fees paid by our customers, which principally includes recurring monthly subscription fees, transaction processing fees and a percentage of payment volume processed for certain payment transactions. We also earn professional service fees that may be fixed or based on contracted hourly rates, which represented approximately 6% of our total revenues and 8% of our net revenues (non-GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2020. A high percentage of our revenue is recurring in nature because of the subscription nature of our SaaS platform offerings and the consistency of B2B payments. Our customer and revenue retention rates are extremely high due to the high-quality, mission-critical and embedded nature of our solutions, and the high switching costs associated with these solutions.
 
Industry Overview
 

• | Huge Market. According to Visa, B2B commerce drives approximately 2/3 of global payments. The transactions between businesses annually generate 280 billion global invoices and associated $120+ trillion of global commercial payments. Conventional AR processes for B2B invoicing and payment are highly dated and ripe for disruption. To illustrate, in the United States alone, more than 50% of payments are still being made by paper check, presenting a huge market opportunity for digital transformation. We believe our global total addressable market for digital transformation of accounts receivables with integrated payments is extremely large, and estimate that in North America alone that total addressable market is approximately $10.9 billion, based on an estimated 43,500 businesses with annual revenues of $50 million or more in the United States and Canada that are in industries that use our products and services and with a potential estimated annual revenue of approximately $250,000 for each such business, which is our estimated representative annual spend for customers that fully utilize our platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable Trends. The need for modern, digital invoice presentment and payment acceptance is fueled by B2B buyers and governments. B2B commerce is increasingly digital, with the global B2B e-commerce market size estimated to reach $20.9 trillion by 2027. Rapid adoption of SaaS platform AP solutions like AvidXchange, Coupa, and SAP Ariba by B2B buyers creates complexity for supplier AR departments, requiring manual activity for invoice presentment, remittance capture and electronic payment processing. In addition, governments are requiring B2B sellers to interact with electronic tax validation systems in order to present invoices. The 2020 global pandemic has accelerated the demand for faster and more efficient digital B2B interactions. Companies need solutions that enable AR professionals to work outside of the office, generate cost savings from operational efficiency, address increased pressure on working capital, and provide a superior customer experience. Our platform addresses such challenges and is poised to benefit from these favorable industry conditions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Key Market Challenges. Finance leaders globally are tasked with digitally transforming their AR processes. Major AR-related challenges listed by finance leaders are high operating expenses, insufficient speed of receiving and applying cash, working capital tied up by high days sales outstanding (“DSO”) and costly manual labor with high risk of errors. In addition, for their businesses to remain competitive, finance leaders also increasingly seek to provide a differentiated experience to their business customers, including self-service capabilities, integrated payments, automated interaction with AP portals and real time customer credit insight to enable more accelerated transactions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Sending invoices via mail and manually processing paper checks and remittance is labor intensive, costly and exposes businesses to risk from third parties like postal services. Businesses that have not automated their collections processes are unable to drive process consistency across teams, effectively optimize account targeting, or systematically execute multi-touch campaigns to increase recoveries. AR leaders are under pressure to address these inefficiencies, with seven out of ten in the United States indicating they are planning to adopt accounts receivables automation solutions by 2023.
 
There has been a new generation of companies focused on B2B automation. We have been a leader in this field since our formation in 2001.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive ecosystem integrations. The digital transformation of AR requires integration with various participants, including AP portals, banks, ERP systems and other independent software vendors. Our platform seamlessly connects with these participants. Many of these participants have different standards and protocols, and it is a challenge for suppliers to satisfy and maintain their interoperability as standards and protocols change over time. Our robust integrations and partner ecosystem enable businesses to send and receive invoices and payments the way they want. For example, we partner with over 160 leading AP portals to automatically deliver invoices, enabling AR professionals to avoid the labor and expense of manually keying invoice data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrated payments with frictionless money movement capabilities. The ultimate objective of AR is to receive and apply payments. Our platform enables payment acceptance and remittance capture to be achieved across various touchpoints. We support multiple payment modalities as well as a wide variety of currencies. Additionally, we help our customers comply with various regulations including those related to privacy, anti-money laundering (“AML”) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generate high customer return on investment with short payback period. We are focused on driving business outcomes. Our solutions automate AR departments, accelerate cash flow, minimize man-hours, reduce processing and compliance costs and help our customers scale more efficiently. We achieve these results for our customers by optimizing across credit, order, invoicing, payments, cash application and collections functions. We have a dedicated customer success team that helps our customers deploy best practices and uses a data-driven campaign-based approach to rapidly drive our customers’ customers to adopt electronic solutions. Our eSolutions programs drive significantly more usage of electronic invoice delivery and payments and provide greater cost savings for our customers than organizations trying to do it on their own. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Payments Network (BPN). The BPN is a unique, digital payments highway that brings together suppliers and buyers in a highly efficient manner. According to a 2018 Mastercard report, more than 50% of B2B payments are still done by paper check and via manual processes. Our proprietary “Digital Lockbox” combines payments and remittance data from multiple sources, enabling dramatically decreased manual cash application processes. As an open network, the BPN provides broad support for the payments industry and currently integrates with 160 AP providers and banks with its open network approach.

Growth Strategies
 
We take a multi-pronged approach to growing our business. Some of the key elements include:
 

• | Acquire new customers. We have an opportunity to further scale sales and marketing activities to acquire new logos in both the mid-market and enterprise space. By investing in demand generation and broadening our sales coverage teams, we can increase the quantity of new sales opportunities and resultant conversions to customers. We also have growing volume of referrals from existing partners and customers who provide us with an additional pipeline of prospects. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Cross and up-sell to existing customers. The breadth of our platform enables a land and expand approach to increasing customer value. Customers generally contract for a subset of available modules and then expand as they progress on their digital transformation journey. In addition, newly acquired customers may begin with one operating division or subsidiary company creating a meaningful opportunity to increase the value delivered and resultant revenue to us by cross-selling to other business units within a corporate entity. Our customer churn rate of less than 3% demonstrates the sticky nature of our customer relationships and our net dollar retention rate of greater than 100% evidences the opportunity for expanded growth within the existing customer base. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monetize payments. The B2B payments space is ripe for digital transformation, and we have a compelling opportunity to increase our volume of payments processed and further monetize a larger proportion of transactions as they shift to digital methods from paper check. For the 12 months ended August 31, 2020, the monetary volume associated with invoice data processed across our various modules was approximately $1.0 trillion. We directly processed approximately $55 billion in electronic payments on behalf of our customers over the same time period. As more customers shift to accepting digital payments, we will monetize this increased activity through higher subscription and merchant processing revenue. This accelerating shift to digital payments across B2B fuels revenue growth opportunities with existing customers, new logos and within the BPN for us. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale the BPN. We believe the BPN is well-positioned to be the leading and de-facto payments network in the B2B space. Our relationship with Visa provides distribution into multiple bank channels, and when combined with the growing count of participating AP entities, the BPN is well-positioned to serve as “the rails” for B2B payments. As our customers and their end customers connect through the BPN, our member network organically expands and we are able to monetize different parts of the network and increase revenue from the BPN. We charge fees when AP providers send payments, when suppliers receive payments and when we process payments through our payment facilitator merchant processing solution. We expect the favorable market conditions for the BPN and its approach to expanding the BPN’s use to provide significant revenue growth opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into new geographies. Our platform is currently equipped with international capabilities, with overseas invoice delivery to recipients in over 190 countries, acceptance of multiple currencies and compatibility with multiple languages. The market for global invoicing services is large, with over 280 billion annual invoices delivered globally. Looking ahead, we will seek to further extend and build upon our platform to engage with and target customers in other developed markets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic M&A. In addition to growing our business organically, we will continue to opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions to increase market share, enhance solutions and capabilities, and expand internationally. We have a proven track record of successfully sourcing, acquiring and integrating acquisitions, which has enhanced our growth and has helped build out our end to end platform. Our dedicated team of corporate development professionals and deep experience in M&A favorably position us for success in this area.

Billtrust’s Go-to-Market Strategy
 
We target middle market and enterprise companies that serve a wide variety of customers and have high frequency sales with complicated AR processing requirements. Our target market includes both mid-market and enterprise corporations across a variety of industry verticals. We are largely a direct sales organization and work in tandem with a variety of channel partners including banks, AP providers, industry associations, VARs and ERPs.
 
The breadth of our platform enables us to market modules for digital transformation across the entire AR spectrum and also allows us to focus on particular customer pain points. This includes functional areas of credit, order, invoicing, payments, cash application and collection. In most cases, our new customer acquisitions are initially for one to two modules, including integrated payments. This creates a significant land and expand opportunity, which is a key underlying objective and value driver in our business.
 
We calibrate our sales and marketing activities based upon the size of the customer and whether the customer is an existing customer or a new logo opportunity.
 

• | New Customer Acquisition. Our direct sales team consists of sales representatives that have designated portfolios of accounts. We use account-based selling and marketing. This includes persona identification such as individual influencers, gatekeepers and decision makers. We also take a classic funnel approach to marketing against a large number of targets that drives activity to the top of our sales funnel. Our account development team quickly manages this activity to qualify leads and transition opportunities to our sales executives. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 13
 

• | Existing Customer Expansion. We follow a land and expand strategy and regularly seek to grow our business by expanding within our existing customer base. This is achieved by selling new modules into that base, penetrating additional divisions or related parties, and activating incremental electronic payment processing activity. Our teams identify the expansion opportunity within each account based on modules purchased and proclivity to purchase additional solutions based on industry and company dynamics. This enables disciplined account planning, targeting, execution and success measurement.

Research & Development
 
We are committed to helping finance leaders and their organizations provide a cost-effective and differentiated customer experience for billing and payments. Through a combination of primary and secondary market research, we constantly seek to identify new solutions to build as well as ways to improve current solutions in order to help these leaders serve their customers better. Specific actions include product roadmap planning, quality assurance and testing of new and existing product technology and maintenance and enhancement of our existing technology and infrastructure. Our research and development organization is comprised of engineering, data science, product and User Experience (“UX”) design teams. Our engineering teams are responsible for developing new proprietary technology, and also innovate by applying existing technologies within AR processes. Our research and development staff are constantly seeking to provide new insights from data analysis and strengthen predictive models. We believe that user interactions with our software need to be productive and enjoyable, and consequently we are highly focused on investing in UX design. We are committed to delivering impactful, highly-connected, easy-to-deploy, enterprise-grade solutions for AR with integrated payments.
Competition
 
All mid-market and enterprise businesses require order-to-cash processes. However, most order-to-cash processes are often manual and dated, with limited automation or ERP customization. Such conventional processes remain our single largest competitor to date. Other competitors include smaller players that focus on disparate AR solutions with limited payments integration. We are unaware of any single integrated AR provider with revenues greater than $150 million with whom we directly compete.
 
The market for our cash cycle management products, including e-commerce order, credit application, invoice presentment, payment facilitation and automated cash applications, is fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. Our competitors range from large entities to smaller suppliers of solutions that focus on billing, invoicing solutions and/or electronic bill presentment and payment. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment will remain intense going forward. Accounting software providers, as well as the financial institutions with which we partner, may internally develop products, acquire existing, third-party products or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their product offerings to compete with our platform or provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than us. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships.
 
The category of AR automation is also emerging, following similar growth patterns as the ongoing digital transformation of AP solutions offered by companies like Coupa or SAP Ariba.
 
Successfully combining AR with integrated payments functionality within companies’ overall information technology footprint can help companies reduce their AR operating costs and increase speed of invoicing, cash receipt and cash application. We believe that the key competitive factors in our market include:
 

• | High customer satisfaction and return on investment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to automate and digitally transform AR processes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Product quality, configurability, and functionality;
--+-----------------------------------------------------

On the basis of these factors, we believe we are well-positioned among our competitors to help mid-market and enterprise businesses transform their AR with integrated payments. Specifically, we believe we can enable greater operational efficiency and improve customer experiences for billing and payments. We expect industry transformation will be influenced by ongoing digitization of B2B e-commerce and AP processes, government tax reforms requiring electronic invoicing and increased demand for work-from-home solutions for AR and integrated payments.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
We operate in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. We operate through clearance and settlement systems of regulated financial institutions. The accounts that are used to move money on behalf of our customers are at banks with which we maintain contractual relationships. We enter into direct contracts with our customers, and for certain of those who provide goods or services, we act as agent of payment.
 
We have implemented an AML program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Our program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and other foreign authorities. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols and internal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer to oversee the programs, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing risks.
 
We collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire in connection with our customers’ use of our services, is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations in the United States. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describes our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information.
 
In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union (the “EU”), have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information which are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, new laws and regulations may be enacted, or we may modify our products or services in the future, which may subject us to such laws and regulations. For example, Europe’s top court (the Court of Justice of the European Union) recently ruled that the Privacy Shield, a mechanism used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the EU and United States, was invalid and could no longer be used and also called into question the use of the standard contractual clauses.
 
Various regulatory agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which are applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, information sharing, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant.
 
 15
 
Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required certifications or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, please see the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under Part I, Item IA “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Business and Industry.”
 
Intellectual Property
 
Certain of our products and services are based on proprietary software and related solutions. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our technology, including with respect to our proprietary rights related to our products and services. In addition, we license technology from third parties that is integrated into some of our solutions.

Business Combination
 
We were originally known as South Mountain Merger Corp, or SMMC. On January 12, 2021, SMMC consummated the Business Combination with Legacy Billtrust pursuant to that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated October 18, 2020 (as amended on December 13, 2020, the “BCA”), among SMMC, Legacy Billtrust, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, SMMC changed its name to BTRS Holdings Inc. Legacy Billtrust was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Mergers based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. While SMMC was the legal acquirer in the Mergers, because Legacy Billtrust was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Legacy Billtrust became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Mergers.
 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (the “Effective Time”), each share of preferred stock of Legacy Billtrust (the “Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock”) that was issued and outstanding was automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Legacy Billtrust Common Stock”), of Legacy Billtrust at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Legacy Billtrust (as amended), such that each converted share of Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock was no longer outstanding and ceased to exist, and each holder of Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock thereafter ceased to have any rights with respect to such securities (the “Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock Conversion”).
 
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of SMMC, First Merger Sub, Legacy Billtrust or the holders of any of the following securities:
 
(a)   each share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that were held by Legacy Billtrust stockholders who neither voted in favor of the First Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the “DGCL”) and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters’ rights (the “Dissenting Shares”) and the Cancelled Shares (as defined below)) was cancelled and converted into (i) the contingent right to receive a number of shares of South Mountain Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“South Mountain Class A Common Stock”) or South Mountain Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“South Mountain Class C Common Stock”), as applicable (such shares, the “Earnout Shares”) (which may be zero (0)); provided, however that such contingent right to receive Earnout Shares will not be applicable for the corresponding shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock exchanged in a Cash Election (as defined below), and (ii) (A) if the holder of such shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock made a proper and timely election to receive cash (“Cash Election”) with respect to such shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock (each such share, a “Cash Electing Share”), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the quotient of $1,189,504,520 divided by the Legacy Billtrust Outstanding Shares (as defined below) (the “Per Share Merger Consideration Value”) and (B) if the holder of such share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock made a proper and timely election to receive shares of South Mountain Class A Common Stock or South Mountain Class C Common Stock, as applicable (a “Stock Election”), with respect to such share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock, which election has not been revoked, or the holder of such share fails to make a Cash Election or Stock Election with respect to such share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock, the Per Share Stock Consideration (as defined below);
 
 16
 
(b)   each share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock or Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock (together, “Legacy Billtrust Capital Stock”) held in the treasury of Legacy Billtrust was cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution was made with respect thereto (such shares of Legacy Billtrust Capital Stock, the “Cancelled Shares”);
 
(c)   each share of common stock of First Merger Sub, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;
 
(d)   each option to purchase Legacy Billtrust Common Stock, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Legacy Billtrust Option”) was assumed by SMMC and converted into (i) an option to purchase shares of South Mountain Class A Common Stock (each, a “Converted Option”), and (ii) the contingent right to receive a number of Earnout Shares (or restricted stock units of SMMC denominated in a number of shares of Class 1 common stock,  par value $0.0001 per share (“Class 1 Common Stock” or “Common Stock”) with respect to unvested options to purchase Legacy Billtrust Common Stock) if certain share prices of Common Stock are achieved and other conditions are satisfied following the Closing Date. Each Converted Option will have and be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to such Legacy Billtrust Option immediately before the Effective Time, except that (A) each Converted Option became exercisable for that number of shares of South Mountain Class A Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (1) the number of shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock subject to the Legacy Billtrust Option immediately before the Effective Time and (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration; and (B) the per share exercise price for each share of South Mountain Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Converted Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock of such Legacy Billtrust Option immediately before the Effective Time by (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration; and
 
(e)   The following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them below:
  
“Legacy Billtrust Outstanding Shares” means the total number of shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock and Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock (on an “as-converted” to Legacy Billtrust Common Stock basis) on a fully diluted basis as of the Closing Date using the treasury method of accounting, including, without duplication, the number of shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock issued upon the Legacy Billtrust Preferred Stock Conversion, the number of shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of all Legacy Billtrust Options and the shares of Legacy Billtrust Common Stock underlying that certain warrant of Legacy Billtrust exercisable into 14,527 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued to Square 1 Bank on July 10, 2014 or any other Equity Equivalents (as defined in the BCA).
 
“Per Share Stock Consideration” means a number of shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock equal to (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value divided by (ii) 10.
 
“SMMC Elected Common Stock” means South Mountain Class A Common Stock; provided, that “SMMC Elected Common Stock” means South Mountain Class C Common Stock with respect to one Legacy Billtrust stockholder that elected to receive South Mountain Class C Common Stock.

 
At the effective time of the Second Merger (the “Second Effective Time”), by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of SMMC, Surviving Corporation, Second Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of SMMC or the Surviving Corporation or the Second Merger Sub: (x) each share of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time was cancelled and ceased to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor; and (y) each membership interest in Second Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time was converted into and became one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership interest in the Surviving Entity, which constitutes the only outstanding equity of the Surviving Entity. From and after the Second Effective Time, all certificates, if any, representing membership interests in Second Merger Sub have been deemed for all purposes to represent the number of membership interests of the Surviving Entity into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

A description of the Business Combination and the terms of the BCA are included in the definitive proxy statement, consent solicitation statement and final prospectus, dated December 22, 2020 (the “Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus”) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in the section entitled “Proposal No. 2—The Business Combination Proposal” beginning on page 114 of the Proxy Statement/Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus.
 
On October 18, 2020, a number of purchasers (each, a “Subscriber”) agreed to purchase from us an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of South Mountain Class A Common Stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $200,000,000, pursuant to separate subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) entered into effective as of October 18, 2020. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, we gave certain registration rights to the Subscribers with respect to the PIPE Shares. The sale of PIPE Shares was consummated concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination.
 
Following the consummation of the Business Combination, all outstanding shares of South Mountain Class A Common Stock were reclassified as shares of Class 1 Common Stock on a one-to-one basis and all outstanding shares of South Mountain Class C Common Stock were reclassified as shares of Class 2 Common Stock on a one-to-one basis. As of the Closing Date and following the completion of the Business Combination, we had the following outstanding securities:

 

• | approximately 138,724,644 shares of Class 1 Common Stock, including 2,375,000 shares that are subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions in the Share and Warrant Cancellation Agreement (as defined below);

• | approximately 12,500,000 warrants, each exercisable for one share of Class 1 Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the “Warrants”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
The rights of holders of our Class 1 Common Stock and Warrants are governed by our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our amended and restated bylaws (the “Bylaws”) and the DGCL, and, in the case of the Warrants, the Warrant Agreement, dated June 19, 2019, between SMMC and the Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as the warrant agent.


Corporate Information
 
SMMC was incorporated in Delaware in February 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. SMMC completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) in June 2019. In January 2021, a business combination between SMMC and Legacy Billtrust was effected through the mergers of (a) First Merger Sub with and into Legacy Billtrust with Legacy Billtrust surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SMMC (Legacy Billtrust, in its capacity as the surviving corporation of the merger, being referred to as the “Surviving Corporation”) and (b) the Surviving Corporation with and into Second Merger Sub, with Second Merger Sub being the surviving entity of the Second Merger, which ultimately resulted in Legacy Billtrust becoming a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of SMMC. In connection with the Mergers, we changed our name to BTRS Holdings Inc.

Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
