CORPORATE STRATEGY
Acceleration of digitization is having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today’s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand, anywhere, anytime. Organizations in the media industry are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow, and are facing a number of challenges, including:
•Increasing rate of content creation and digitization of media assets - Many organizations are feeling intense pressure to create more and more content, increasingly tailored for audience niches, while also facing greater competition from nimble players. At the same time, access to creative software tools is wider today than ever before, giving more people the ability to tell their stories.
•Exponential growth of distribution platforms - The number of distribution platforms continues to expand, and the economic models of new distribution platforms are still evolving. To satisfy their customers, organizations need to develop or license content for their distribution platforms. Many organizations need to embrace new opportunities while also maximizing heritage business.
•Continued increase in content consumption - There has been a tremendous increase in viewership in the last decade, but it is spread across many outlets and channels. This increase in viewership is dwarfed by an increase in competitive content. In addition, with growing audience fragmentation, compelling content, brand equity, and relevance are even more critical today.
•Disparate mix of tools, skills, and workflows - Lack of commonality and a fragmented supplier landscape creates incompatibilities, inhibiting agility, collaboration, sharing, and efficiency.
•Media technology budgets - Today’s economic realities are placing pressure on media technology budgets, while content output must increase exponentially to deliver on the market requirements. Many content creators and distributors have to work with essentially flat budgets, which demands more efficient workflows and solutions.
We believe we are well positioned in the media technology industry because we have a set of differentiated creative software tools (including ProTools for audio and Media Composer for video), a differentiated platform strategy (Avid MediaCentral platform described below) and a well-established market position. Our products and solutions allow our customers to (i) create high-quality, engaging, and immersive content, (ii) distribute to more outlets and devices, (iii) maximize and protect the value of media assets, and (iv) create operational and capital efficiency. As a result of our market position across the media industry, we believe we can take advantage of the following opportunities and trends:
•Large and growing market poised for transition - Our customers are facing significant disruption and need to make major changes and investments in their business and operational approaches to address the challenges described above. Our product offerings help them address those challenges.
•Deeply entrenched with a market leadership position - We can strategically leverage a significant global customer base that is loyal to our brand across TV, film, music, and media. 
•Positioned to help the industry navigate disruption - Our unique approach encompasses a common technology platform, leading software applications and integrated solutions with a large and open ecosystem, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
•Ready to intercept the next emerging opportunity - By leveraging our partnership with Microsoft and our MediaCentral platform, we believe we can lead the media and entertainment industry into the cloud with market-leading Software as a Service, or SaaS, offerings.
Our strategy for connecting creative professionals and media enterprises with audiences in a powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way leverages our creative software tools, including Pro Tools for audio and Media Composer for video, and our MediaCentral Platform - the open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies content workflows by integrating all Avid or third-party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, and enables fast and easy creation, delivery, and monetization of content.
We work to ensure that we are meeting customer needs, staying ahead of industry trends, and investing in the right areas through a close and interactive relationship with our customer base. The Avid Community Association was established to be an innovative and influential media technology community. It represents thousands of organizations and over 30,000 professionals from all levels of the industry including inspirational and award-winning thought leaders, innovators, and storytellers. The Avid Community Association fosters collaboration between Avid, its customers, and other industry colleagues to help shape our product offerings and provide a means to shape our industry together. 
A key element of our strategy is our transition to a recurring revenue-based model through a combination of subscription offerings, maintenance contracts, and long-term agreements. We started offering subscription licensing options for some of our products and solutions in 2014 and by the end of 2021 had approximately 410,000 paid subscriptions. Starting in the third quarter of 2021, subscription count includes all paid and active seats under multi-seat licenses. These licensing options offer choices in pricing and deployment to suit our customers’ needs. We expect to increase subscription sales to media enterprises going forward as we expand offerings and move through customer upgrade cycles, which we expect will further increase recurring revenue on a longer-term basis. Our long-term agreements are comprised of multi-year agreements with large media enterprise customers to provide specified products and services, including SaaS offerings, and agreements with channel partners and resellers to purchase minimum amounts of products and service over a specified period of time.
During the third quarter of 2021, Avid began implementing a digital transformation which focuses on optimizing systems, processes, and back-office functions with the objective of improving our operations related to our digital and subscription
business. Over the next four years, we plan to significantly invest in transforming our enterprise-wide infrastructure and technologies to benefit customers and drive enhanced performance across the company.

Enterprise Software Solutions
Avid’s Enterprise Software Solutions are built on the MediaCentral platform along with a suite of applications, modules, and services and is also the foundation of our cloud and SaaS offerings.
MediaCentral
MediaCentral | Cloud UX is Avid’s next-generation media production suite that further extends the Avid MediaCentral platform into the cloud. The MediaCentral platform scales from the simplest to the most sophisticated solutions. Built on a customizable cloud native microservices architecture, MediaCentral platform features a cloud-based user experience that runs on any device, as well as workflow modules for editorial, production, news, graphics, and asset management. It also features applications to enhance and scale any of those modules, and a wide array of media services and partner connectors. Every user is connected in a completely integrated workflow environment with a user-friendly interface, and gains a unified view into all their media with flexible deployment options for on premises, hybrid, or cloud (public/private) environments.
As part of the Avid MediaCentral platform, we also offer Avid Nexis| Edge, (formally known as Editorial Management) a module for smaller creative teams that provides the same robust media management capabilities used by the largest media enterprises in the industry. Integrated within Media Composer via a panel, Nexis| Edge connects directly to Avid NEXIS storage to provide easy access to media with hyper-search functionality. Avid Nexis| Edge also extends collaboration capabilities for the assistant editor in an easy to use web interface by allowing Media Composer bin creation, logging, and search capabilities, greatly expanding the efficiency of creative teams.
SaaS Solutions
We have a strategic partnership with Microsoft to deliver Azure-certified solutions to support end-to-end hybrid and cloud deployments of news workflows. Our partnership includes developing virtualized versions of many of our product offerings, allowing them to run in a private cloud, public cloud, or in hybrid deployments. This enables customers to migrate to more traditional IT infrastructures leveraging IP technology to integrate disparate systems within a post production and broadcast environment. We believe our new SaaS and cloud offerings will allow our customers to (i) scale production while lowering 
costs, (ii) enable anytime access, boosting efficiency and collaboration, and (iii) deliver content quickly and securely to any device, from anywhere. Our first enterprise SaaS offering, Edit on Demand, has been deployed in post production and news environments.
Integrated Solutions
The Integrated Solutions part of our portfolio mainly consists of four common, best-in-class hardware platforms that are combined with tightly integrated software elements to create powerful and differentiated solutions, all of which complement and enhance our overall software strategy.
Avid NEXIS
Our Avid NEXIS family of shared storage systems are real-time, open solutions that bring the power of shared storage to local, regional, national and multinational broadcasters, and post-production facilities at competitive prices. Customers can improve allocation of creative resources and support changing project needs with an open, shared storage platform that includes file system technology on lower cost hardware, support for third-party applications, and streamlined administration to create more content at an affordable price. Avid NEXIS is the industry’s first and only software-defined storage platform specifically designed for storing and managing media. Avid NEXIS enables fully virtualized storage so media organizations can adjust storage capacity mid-project, without disrupting workflows. Powered by our MediaCentral Platform, Avid NEXIS delivers media storage flexibility, scalability, and control for both Avid-based and third-party workflows.

By tightly integrating Maestro with MediaCentral we enable journalists and producers to add graphics remotely to news stories or enhance any story with innovative stats to drive augmented reality graphics for presenting data in new and compelling ways.
FastServe
Our FastServe video server product line assists broadcasters in making the move to UHD and IP based workflows with a new, modular architecture. The Avid FastServe family integrates with the MediaCentral platform, empowering creative teams to deliver content fast for news, sports, entertainment, and other media productions. Its 10GbE interface offers direct connection to Avid NEXIS storage, enabling real-time ingest, editing, and playout, even while media is being captured. Its modular architecture improves efficiency and provides a smooth transition from HD to UHD, and from SDI workflows to video over IP. We also continue to sell and support our on-air server solutions, including AirSpeed 5000 and AirSpeed 5500, which enable broadcasters to automate the ingest and playout of television and news programming.

Maintenance contracts typically include the right to the latest software updates, call support, and, in some cases, hardware maintenance. Maintenance contracts for individual products are sold bundled with initial product offerings or as renewals once initial contracts have lapsed. Maintenance contracts are also sold on an enterprise basis where a customer purchases maintenance for all Avid products owned. Our Customer Care team provides customers with a partner committed to giving them help and support when they need it. Our global Customer Care team of industry professionals offers a blend of technology expertise and real-world experience throughout the audio, visual, and entertainment industries.  The team’s mission is to provide timely, informed responses to our customers’ issues and proactive maintenance for our solutions to help our customers maintain high standards of operational effectiveness.

The competitive landscape is fragmented with a large number of companies providing various types of products and services in different markets and geographic areas. We provide integrated solutions that compete based on total workflow value, features, quality, service, and flexibility of pricing and deployment options.

OPERATIONS
Sales and Services Channels 
We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect, and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace, and also through the Xchange Market Platform, or XMP, with some of our key partners and distributors.
We have significant international operations with offices in 16 countries and the ability to reach approximately 171 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 58%, 60% and 63% of our total net revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues and long-lived assets can be found in Note P to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues in that quarter and are included in revenue backlog.
We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives. We also provide customer care services indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers, and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training.
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of a network of contract manufacturers around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, from whom we 
purchase finished assemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. We depend on sole-source suppliers for many key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. 
Our contract manufacturers and OEMs manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of facilities located throughout the world and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. For additional information about risks associated with our sole source suppliers and and manufacturing operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development
We are committed to delivering best-in-class digital media content-creation solutions that are designed for the unique needs, skills and sophistication levels of our target customer markets as well as a standardized media platform for the media industry. Having helped establish the digital media technology industry, we are building on a 30-year heritage of innovation and leadership in developing content-creation solutions and platforms. We have research and development, or R&D, operations in six facilities located in five countries. Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution, and monetization tools as well as the media platform. These tools operate primarily on the Mac and on Windows platforms, whereas the media platform primarily operates on Linux platforms. Our R&D efforts also include highly optimized media storage solutions, standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, and ingest and playout solutions to cover the entire workflow. Our R&D expenditures for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $65.6 million, $57.0 million and $62.3 million, respectively, which represented 16%, 16% and 15% of our total net revenues, respectively.
Our philosophy is to prioritize research and development investments to take advantage of market opportunities based on the following short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons:
•Here & Now - Improve performance, solidify core portfolio, improve margins, and ignite growth. 
•Emerging - Expand opportunities by pursuing growth areas, extending our product portfolio, and expanding market opportunities.
•Transformational - Build for the future, creating unique defensible differentiation in our products and solutions with disruptive and visionary innovation.
Our company-operated R&D operations are located in: Burlington, Massachusetts; Berkeley, California; Munich, Germany; Kfar Saba, Israel; Szczecin, Poland; and Montreal, Canada. We also partner with a vendor in Kiev, Ukraine for outsourced R&D services. For additional information about risks associated with our R&D efforts, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property
We regard our software and hardware as proprietary and protect our proprietary interests under the laws of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as through contractual provisions.
We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At February 1, 2022, we held 111 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2040, and had 13 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid Nexis, AirSpeed, FastServe, MediaCentral, Media Composer, Pro Tools, and Sibelius. As a technology company, we regard our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets as being among our most valuable assets, together with the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Our software is licensed to end users pursuant to shrink-wrap, embedded, click-through, or signed license agreements. Our products generally contain features to guard against unauthorized use. Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software piracy is a persistent problem for us, as it is for the software industry in general. For additional information about risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,405 full-time employees and 333 external contractors located globally in 33 countries. Of these, 35% were located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, 45% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 20% in Asia-Pacific. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. A vast majority of our office workers continue to telecommute as we have implemented a work from anywhere policy. This allows our employees to choose their workstyle whether it be fully remote, fully onsite, or a mix of the two. Within our office areas we have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements when necessary, enhanced cleaning, encouraging daily self-health checks, and access to virtual primary care physicians. All of the actions above are overseen by Avid’s Crisis Management Team, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of Avid’s COVID-19 response. In addition, we have created a TeamAvid Community, where employees can virtually share communications, collaborate, and engage with each other from their remote locations. This was implemented as a way to keep employees connected throughout the pandemic. 
We believe in fostering great leaders. Through our Avid University platform, we have built the opportunity for employees to power their performance with continuous learning and development courses to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Avid to operate our global business of empowering media creators with innovative technology and collaborative tools to entertain, inform, educate, and enlighten the world. We also offer tuition reimbursement for eligible classes at external education organizations that may not be covered under Avid University. 
We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. We are focused on creating a company culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be creative, innovative and competitive. To achieve these objectives, we have adopted and regularly communicate to our employees our core values of Trusted, Empowered, Passionate, and Inclusive. We believe in the power of an increasingly diverse, inclusive, and collaborative team and we embrace and leverage the global community of TeamAvid. We believe that diverse and inclusive companies are more productive and deliver better performance than their counterparts, and we seek to better mirror our diverse customer and user base to best serve them.
To further that focus, Avid has implemented the Global Leadership Team, or GLT. The GLT is comprised of a group of global leaders throughout the organization who are either key stakeholders in our business or an important beacon of our culture. The GLT meets with the Executive Team and Senior Management Teams to align on corporate strategy, culture and development. Avid has taken many steps to expand diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) within the company. At the governance level, Avid now has a Steering Committee for DEI; Mission, Vision and Goals statements for DEI; and a DEI Policy. In terms of recruitment, three women are on the executive leadership team, and in 2021 Avid recruited 58 percent women globally. Avid considers DEI training as an essential part of creating an inclusive culture with self-paced online learning topics addressing inclusion, LGBTQIA+ issues, and inclusive retention and career direction. Avid is enhancing its global onboarding process to include DEI training for all employees.
