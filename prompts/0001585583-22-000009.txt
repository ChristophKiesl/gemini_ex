ITEM 1.    Business
Company Overview
Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. ("Del Taco") is a nationwide operator and franchisor of restaurants featuring fresh and fast made-to-order cuisine, including both Mexican inspired and American classic dishes. As of December 28, 2021, there were 600 Del Taco restaurants, a majority of these in the Pacific Southwest. We serve our guests high-quality, freshly prepared food typical of fast casual restaurants but with the speed, convenience and value associated with traditional quick service restaurants ("QSRs"). With attributes of both a fast casual restaurant and a QSR—a combination we call QSR+—we occupy a place in the restaurant market distinct from most competitors. Our food is prepared in working kitchens where our guests see cooks grilling marinated chicken and steak, chopping tomatoes and cilantro for salsa, grating cheddar cheese, slicing avocados and slow cooking whole pinto beans. And we believe that we are poised for growth, operating within a fast growing segment of the restaurant industry, the limited service restaurant (“LSR”) segment.
Our distinctive menu offers a combination of Mexican-inspired food, such as tacos and burritos, and American classics, such as “Double Del” cheeseburgers, crinkle-cut fries and milkshakes. The dual menu offers something for everyone, helping us attract a broader customer base than other Mexican LSRs while eliminating the “veto vote.” Additionally, our menu features both premium items such as our Beyond Tacos, our signature plant-based protein taco, Platos plated meals, Epic Burritos®, Handcrafted Ensaladas and Fresca Bowls, as well as lower priced items on our Del's Dollar Deals menu. While the lower priced items appeal to a value-oriented customer, the Del's Dollar Deals menu is also designed to increase the average check by offering variety for customers wishing to supplement their order with an additional menu item. With our tiered pricing strategy we appeal to customers from a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds and price sensitivities.
We opened our first restaurant in Yermo, California in 1964. The original restaurant had a simple menu consisting of 19 cent tacos, tostadas and french fries and 24 cent cheeseburgers. Over the last 57 years, located now in 16 states, we have grown to 294 company-operated and 306 franchise-operated restaurants as of December 28, 2021.
Merger Agreement with Jack in the Box Inc.
On December 5, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "2021 Merger Agreement") with Jack in the Box Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Jack in the Box"). Pursuant to the 2021 Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Jack in the Box will merge with and into the Company (the "2022 Merger"), with the Company as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jack in the Box. At the effective time of the 2022 Merger, each share of common stock of the Company outstanding will be converted into the right to receive $12.51 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approval by the Company's shareholders. On March 7, 2022, the Company conducted a shareholder meeting which approved the 2021 Merger Agreement, and the 2022 Merger is expected to close during the second week of March 2022.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth:
Meeting Many Needs, our Concept has Broad Appeal. We are able to appeal to a broad group of customers due to our diverse menu featuring both Mexican and American staples, our 24-hour service model in most restaurants, the range of options we offer for any time of day or night, the comfort of our dining room paired with the convenience of our drive-thru, and our carefully considered pricing strategy with items of exceptional quality and value at a variety of price points. Our QSR+ positioning sources traffic from both QSR and fast casual dining segments and we believe our diversified sales mix creates a flexible business model with multiple levers to drive restaurant sales growth. Because we are able to meet the varied needs of a wide range of customers, we have broad appeal in a variety of urban, suburban and other settings and in many different parts of the United States.
Unfreshing Believable® Food. We are committed to delivering made-to-order food, using fresh high quality ingredients in working kitchens. We emphasize both quality and speed and effectively market these strengths to customers both within the restaurants and beyond. The menu offers items that have been enjoyed by customers for decades in combination with newer offerings addressing market trends, such as the launch of Crispy Chicken Tacos with sauce offerings that included ranch, habenero, Cholula and a new honey mango sauce, Beyond Tacos, made with plant-based proteins, Queso Blanco, made with real cheese, real milk, jalapeños and heavy cream, The Del Taco, our bigger, better-tasting crunchy beef taco, and Platos, our 
premium menu offering of individually-plated meals complete with an entrée, two sides, and chips and salsa. Historically, we also use limited-time specials to drive traffic, such as Tamales, Carnitas, Jumbo Shrimp and Shredded Beef. With our menu variety including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls and handcrafted ensaladas, as well as burgers and fries, we are able to be highly responsive to customer demands and target underutilized day-parts with new menu innovation. We prepare entrées to order, but are able to deliver the entrée to the customer, on average, in just over 2 minutes across all day-parts and service modes. Even with the addition of new products, the coordinated work of operational and marketing leadership helps ensure that a new item is only launched when operations are ready to deliver on our promises of speed, quality and value. We believe that the way we combine freshly prepared food in working kitchens with our speed of service model and the skill of our trained and certified team members provides a layer of competitive insulation.
Inviting Atmosphere. In order to enhance our competitive positioning, we recently debuted our new Fresh Flex prototype for our restaurants. In the design, restaurant exteriors offer an attractive curb appeal with a signature Del Taco logo, an open, well-illuminated building structure, back-lit towers and a vibrant color palette that reinforces the brand identity. Restaurant interiors feature open kitchens and visual freshness cues, such as built-in freshness coolers, to highlight our commitment to high-quality ingredients and freshly prepared food. Freshness coolers are located near the point-of-order in most restaurants and showcase our fresh produce, 40 pound blocks of cheddar cheese and handmade pico de gallo. In addition to being used for new restaurants, the new design will also be used in the remodeling of existing restaurants.
Promising Industry Segment.  With our QSR+ model, we believe that we offer QSR convenience and value with high quality fresh food associated with fast casual dining.  We believe that our differentiated menu, enhanced restaurant design, aligned service model and convenient locations with drive-thrus position us to compete successfully against other QSR concepts, providing us with a large addressable market.
Positive Demographic Trends. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from a number of culinary and demographic trends in the United States. We expect that over time an improving macroeconomic environment will raise consumer demand for restaurant services, increasing sales. Furthermore, we expect to benefit from increased acceptance of and preference for Mexican food in the United States. Finally, we also anticipate benefits from the continued growth of the Hispanic population in the United States, which, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, has grown from 50.5 million people in 2009 to 60.1 million people in 2019, and is projected to reach 74.8 million in 2030. 
Data Driven Operations Culture. To deliver on our brand promise and ensure that “every guest leaves happy,” we utilize a balanced measurement system for all our restaurants. Elements included are customer surveys, internal audits, staffing metrics, speed of service metrics, sales metrics, and key controllable costs. This provides corporate and field management, as well as restaurant-level operators, insight into how they are performing both from the customer’s perspective but also through the lens of our internal standards, enabling operational initiatives to be tied to the needs of the customer. We take a disciplined approach to developing operational improvement initiatives. We evaluate results-driven behaviors in top performing restaurants using restaurant questing studies, general manager roundtables, and a formal Operations Advisory Committee comprised of both company and franchise operators. We believe our deep attention to research and customer feedback gives us a competitive advantage over restaurants less committed to understanding their customers and allows us to be proactive in our initiatives instead of merely responding to the competition.
Experienced Leadership. Our senior management team has extensive operating experience, with an average of over 15 years of experience each in the restaurant industry. We are led by President and Chief Executive Officer, John Cappasola, who joined Del Taco in 2008, as a Vice President in Marketing through 2011 when he became our Chief Brand Officer until he became President in January 2017 and Chief Executive Officer in July 2017. Other key members of our senior leadership team include Steven Brake, Chief Financial Officer, and Chad Gretzema, Chief Operating Officer. We believe the proven ability of the senior officers to work as a team will play a critical role in our ability to continue to achieve success in the future. We believe the senior management team is a key driver of Del Taco’s success and has positioned it well for long-term growth.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe our differentiated QSR+ positioning within a growing market segment combined with a disciplined business model and strong unit economics, will lead to significant growth opportunities. Our plan to enhance the brand’s competitive positioning and generate earnings per share growth involves several distinct strategies, including: optimizing our restaurant portfolio, expanding our restaurant count in established markets where brand recognition is strong, driving restaurant sales growth, optimizing margins, and over time taking advantage of the significant “white space” in the United States where the Del Taco brand is not yet established.
Growing the Restaurant Base. We believe we are in the early stages of our growth story with 600 locations in 16 states (including one franchise-operated restaurant in Guam) as of December 28, 2021. We estimate, based on internal analysis and a study prepared by a leading national consulting firm, a long-term total restaurant potential in the United States of 2,000 locations. For the year ended December 28, 2021, we opened four new company-operated and nine new franchise-operated restaurants. The majority of our future restaurant openings and growth of the brand will come primarily from the development of franchise restaurants. We believe that our development will have a continued focus on new restaurants in markets where the brand is well established as well as certain new or emerging markets.

•Within in-fill markets, which we define as the Western one-third of the United States, where there is strong brand awareness and a loyal following, we have identified an in-fill opportunity of an additional 300+ potential new trade areas for restaurant development. We believe this presents a lower risk expansion strategy leveraging brand awareness, infrastructure and efficiencies of scale. We are currently in the process of accelerating our pipeline of in-fill locations, particularly in the Western United States.
•As we continue to increase and strengthen our position in in-fill markets, we also intend to continue to expand our presence in key emerging markets such as Ohio, Michigan, Oklahoma, Georgia and Florida.
•We view our franchise program as an important resource for expanding the brand. In many new markets, the knowledge of a strategically selected franchisee as to local real estate, customers, employees, and marketing may enhance each restaurant’s prospects for greater success more quickly. Where appropriate, we may consider opportunities to seed new territories with company-operated restaurants, but ultimately expect to have the majority of emerging market growth occur through franchisees. In both in-fill and emerging markets, we expect we will continue to strategically develop franchise relationships and grow our franchise restaurant base. We believe we are well positioned for growth in comparison to other national QSR concepts, many of which are heavily saturated in the United States and/or are highly limited by existing franchise commitments.
Growing Same Store Sales. We have developed an integrated strategic approach that aligns restaurant operations initiatives with marketing, menu innovation and digital strategies. This is the foundation for our sales growth within our existing restaurants. We plan to drive continued same store sales growth by improving customer frequency, attracting new customers and improving per transaction spend. To accomplish this, we aim to enhance our QSR+ positioning and customer perceptions with targeted capital investment in technology and the restaurant experience, optimized marketing spend across traditional and non-traditional channels, and continued introduction of new products driven by customer demand, industry trends, and a focus on day-part opportunities. We also believe we are well positioned in the Mexican LSR segment to benefit from shifting culinary and demographic trends in the United States.
Menu Strategy and Innovation. We intend to continue to evolve our menu to create platforms that convey the differentiated QSR+ positioning and reinforce our “We Start with Fresh and Serve with Value” brand position. We believe we have opportunities for menu innovation as we look to provide customers more choices through quality/value platforms such as The Del Taco, Beyond Tacos, Platos, Epic Burritos®, Handcrafted Ensaladas, Fresca Bowls and Queso Blanco. In addition, we expect to continue to tap in to the need for price/value offerings by building on our value/variety Del's Dollar Deals menu and mid-tier products. Our marketing and operations teams have demonstrated an ability to collaborate to ensure that the items developed in our test kitchen can be executed to high standards in the restaurants with the speed, value and quality that our customers expect.
Driving Brand Awareness and Consumer Engagement. We engage consumers typically through ten annual promotional windows which feature seasonal favorites such as Tamales or Jumbo Shrimp Tacos, quality enhancing platforms such as Carnitas, Platos, Fresca Bowls and Handcrafted Salads, and strong value propositions showcased by the Del's Dollar Deals menu. The key points of differentiation are communicated through our advertising and merchandising.
Launching Mobile and Digital Initiatives. We are positioning the brand to grow sales by expanding points of access through digital initiatives. In 2018, we launched the Del Taco Mobile App, featuring enhanced marketing capabilities including targeted promotional offers to drive guest frequency. In 2019, we launched third party delivery through Grubhub, Postmates and DoorDash at substantially all company-operated restaurants. In 2020, we added third party delivery through UberEats and expanded third party delivery across substantially all franchise-operated restaurants. We believe a multiple delivery service provider approach will position us to optimize driver coverage and maximize consumer demand across trade areas. In 2021, we re-launched the Del Taco Mobile App, including a loyalty program, built on a holistic customer relationship management platform to drive personalized and valued experiences for our guests.
Restaurant Portfolio Optimization. We plan to continue to optimize our restaurant portfolio to help stimulate growth in new restaurants and existing restaurant average unit volumes ("AUVs").  This effort included refranchising five company-operated restaurants in the Yuma, Arizona and El Centro, California markets in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and one company-operated restaurant in an emerging market in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to existing franchisees with proven operational and development capabilities who commit to additional development in the same or other markets. Our restaurant portfolio optimization strategy positions the brand for accelerated franchise growth and focuses company operations on our core Western markets and strategic seed markets to support emerging market growth. The optimization actions completed in 2019 and 2020 helped shift our company ownership from approximately 55% in 2018 to 49% in 2021.  
Leverage Our Infrastructure. Over time we believe we can continue to optimize our margins with effective menu pricing, by maintaining fiscal discipline, increasing fixed-cost leverage and enhancing our supply chain efforts. We currently have an infrastructure that allows us and our franchisees to grow and manage the productivity of each restaurant on a real-time basis. Additionally, we believe over time, as our restaurant base matures and AUVs increase, we will be able to leverage corporate costs as over time general and administrative expenses are expected to grow at a slower rate than revenue. As the restaurant base and restaurant sales expand, we will potentially have larger media budgets, allowing us to target specific opportunistic areas with incremental marketing campaigns.
Site Selection and Expansion
New Restaurant Development
We believe we are positioned for growth with unit economics that enable desirable returns on invested capital and have cash flow available for investment. For the year ended December 28, 2021, we opened four new company-operated restaurants and our franchisees opened nine new restaurants despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during 2021. We will continue to focus on restaurants in in-fill markets where the brand is well established, as well as certain new or emerging markets.
The strategy for restaurant development is three fold. First, in the near term, with an identified in-fill opportunity of an additional 300+ potential new trade areas for restaurant development (company-operated and franchise-operated), we are accelerating our pipeline of in-fill locations to leverage the brand awareness, infrastructure and efficiencies of scale through what we believe is a lower risk, higher return expansion opportunity. Second, we will continue to develop company-operated restaurants in emerging markets such as Orlando, establishing operational expertise, while recruiting additional franchisees to enable us to embed and scale our brand more rapidly. In some markets, we may employ a re-franchising strategy to help stimulate new restaurant growth if we believe it will enhance growth opportunities and longer term earnings per share. Finally, over time we will be entering emerging new markets, primarily with new franchise partners and, where appropriate, with company-operated restaurants. With substantial growth opportunities in established and emerging markets, efforts to expand into new markets will be carefully vetted and researched before they are undertaken.
Site Selection Process
We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in our long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations, utilizing quantitative and qualitative modeling. Our in-house development team has significant prior experience working at other limited and full service brands. For company-operated restaurants, we use a combination of our in-house development team and outside real estate brokers to locate, evaluate and negotiate leases for new sites, taking into account demographic characteristics, residential and daytime population thresholds, retail presence, traffic counts and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility and accessibility of the restaurant. The process for selecting locations applies management’s experience and expertise to an extensive set of objective third party data to support the site selection process. Because our restaurants typically perform well across a variety of neighborhoods and demographics, we have flexibility in selecting new restaurant locations without taking on excessive operating risk.
We have primarily focused on developing freestanding or end-cap sites with drive-thrus. With the recent debut of our new Fresh Flex prototype, our new store design offers multiple buildout options, including small footprint drive-thru only sites in addition to freestanding or end-cap sites with drive-thrus, allowing more flexibility in the site selection process and potentially broader access to real estate opportunities.
New company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants are reviewed by our real estate committee, which includes senior management. The committee monitors ongoing performance to inform future site selection decisions.
Restaurant Design
A typical Del Taco restaurant is a free-standing building with drive-thru service that ranges in size from 2,000 to 2,600 square feet. The new Fresh Flex design offers multiple buildout options, including small footprint drive-thru only sites with no dining rooms, that range in size from 1,200 to 2,400 square feet. In the design, restaurant exteriors offer an attractive curb appeal with a signature Del Taco logo, an open, well-illuminated building structure, back-lit towers and a vibrant color palette that reinforces the brand identity. Restaurant interiors feature open kitchens and visual cues, such as built-in freshness coolers, to highlight our commitment to high-quality ingredients and freshly prepared food. Colorful and contemporary dining rooms, typically with seating for up to approximately 60 people, include a variety of comfortable booths and seating arrangements with contemporary surfaces.
Our new company-operated restaurants are typically ground-up prototypes or conversions. On average, it takes approximately 18 months from identification of the specific site to opening the restaurant. We have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings. Company-operated restaurants are constructed in approximately 13 weeks and the development and construction of new sites is the responsibility of the construction department. A conversion typically takes approximately 10 weeks to complete. The real estate department is responsible for locating and leasing potential restaurant sites and the construction department is then responsible for building the restaurants.
Restaurant Management and Operations
COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted strict protocols to ensure the safety of our employees and guests, including:
•Increasing the frequency of disinfecting and cleaning procedures
•Extending the use of disposable gloves to cashiers and other employees
•Following a strict employee sick policy ensuring employees who are ill stay home until completely healthy
•Establishing policies and procedures to accommodate any employee impacted by COVID-19
•Performing employee health and temperature checks before each shift
Additionally, we have provided options for limited contact ordering through the Del Taco mobile app, delivery service providers and drive-thru. We have also provided options for limited contact payment through the Del Taco mobile app and delivery service providers.
We continue to closely monitor and consult with local health authorities and follow the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the World Health Organization.
Operations
We utilize a balanced scorecard measurement system for all company-operated restaurants. Elements included in the scorecard are customer surveys, internal audits, staffing metrics, speed of service metrics, sales metrics, and key controllable costs. Each period, managers of company-operated restaurants who are top performers on the scorecard are eligible for bonuses to reinforce this balanced approach to the business. The scorecard is also used by the operations leadership team to mine best practices.
To ensure brand consistency and integrity across all system restaurants, we utilize an internal operations audit program. Each restaurant is audited two or more times per year, and each audit results in two scores – a customer experience score and a brand standards score. We also have food safety and quality assurance programs for all system restaurants. Our auditors are part of the operations support team and provide regular performance analysis to the leadership team.
Managers and Team Members
Each Del Taco restaurant typically has a general manager, four to six shift leaders, and two or three team leaders. There are also typically between 15 and 20 team members who prepare food and serve customers. Area Directors lead company-operated restaurants, with each typically responsible for approximately 5 to 12 restaurants. Overseeing the Area Directors are seven Regional Directors, each responsible for approximately 15 to 67 restaurants, and they report up to the Vice President of Company Operations. The franchise operations team utilizes six Franchise Business Consultants who each coach and oversee up to 74 franchise-operated restaurants. The Franchise Business Consultants report to the Vice President of Franchise Operations. The Chief Operating Officer has full accountability for both company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants, managing both sales and profitability targets and customer experience metrics.
Our hiring process is focused on identifying team members that are genuinely friendly, committed to preparing fresh food, and willing to ensure “every guest leaves happy.” We frequently cross-train our team members so they can fill any one of several 
positions to maximize labor efficiency. The investment in helping team members learn multiple skills and our internal promotion path has helped us build loyal teams that care about the success of their restaurant. Many team members and managers have been employed by us for longer than five years, and it is not uncommon to have team members with more than ten years of seniority.
Training
Our senior management team fosters a culture of continuous learning and career growth at Del Taco. On the first day of employment, every team member receives the first of three training modules focused on helping the team member clearly understand the brand and their role. Subsequent modules focus on the specifics of how to provide a consistent customer experience. The current training program is a blended learning approach including self-paced reading, hands-on exercises and written knowledge validation tests. In 2015, we added tablet-based bilingual e-learning which includes interactive exercises, video tutorials and online testing.
A significant portion of the restaurant leadership is comprised of former team members who have advanced along the Del Taco career path. Top performing team members who display leadership qualities take the first step in the management development program and become team leaders. As team leader candidates enter the management development program, they receive additional training and are regularly tested on their knowledge and skills. Shift leader candidates will have completed the three modules, passed all of the required testing and have their knowledge validated during a practical evaluation of one of their shifts. An external candidate for a general manager role will complete six to seven weeks of intensive classroom and hands-on training in a certified training restaurant.
Franchise Program
Overview
We use a franchising strategy to augment new restaurant growth in new and established markets, allowing for brand expansion without significant capital investment. As of December 28, 2021, there were a total of 306 franchise restaurants. Franchisees range in size from single restaurant operators to multi-unit operators, the largest of which owns 54 locations. As of December 28, 2021 and December 29, 2020, our top 12 franchisees operated 62% and 61% of our franchise-operated restaurants, respectively. As of December 28, 2021 and December 29, 2020, our top 20 franchisees operated approximately 74% and 73%, respectively, of our franchise-operated restaurants. The existing franchise base consists of numerous successful, longstanding restaurant operators.
We believe that franchise revenue provides stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to continue expanding the base of franchise-operated restaurants. In established markets, we will encourage continued growth from current franchisees and assist them in identifying and securing new locations. In emerging and new markets, we will source highly qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. We generally seek franchisees from successful, non-competitive brands operating within the expansion markets. We market franchise opportunities through strategic networking, participation in select industry conferences, our existing website and printed materials.
We have two groups to enhance participation and engagement with the franchise community. The Franchise Marketing Advisory Team provides input and feedback on marketing strategy and initiatives. Our Operations Advisory Committee (“OAC”), comprised of experienced franchise and company operators, proposes and analyzes new equipment, training and procedures.
Franchise Owner Support
We have structured our corporate staff, training programs, operational systems and communication systems to ensure we are delivering strong support to franchisees. We assist franchisees with the site selection process, and every new franchise location is scrutinized by our corporate real estate committee. We provide template plans franchisees may use for new restaurant construction and work with franchisees and their design and construction vendors to ensure compliance with brand specifications. A training program is required for all franchisees, operating partners and restaurant management staff. Training materials introduce new franchisees to our operational performance standards and the metrics that help maintain these high standards.
For the first two restaurant openings in a market, we typically provide significant on-site support, with more modest support for subsequent locations. On an ongoing basis, we collect and disseminate customer experience feedback on a real time basis through a third party vendor. We also conduct regular on-site audits at each franchise location. Our Franchise Business Consultants are dedicated to ongoing franchise support and oversight, regularly visiting each franchise territory. We also employ dedicated Franchise Field Marketing Managers to assist franchisees with local marketing programs. We typically communicate with franchisees through an operations newsletter and hold regular regional and system-wide workshops to 
update franchise teams and conduct training. We also hold an annual conference for franchisees, vendors and company operations leaders to review overall performance, celebrate shared success, communicate best practices, and plan for the year ahead.
Marketing and Advertising
We run a highly coordinated marketing and advertising campaign to create customer awareness, engage fans, and maximize positive brand associations. We use multiple marketing channels, including television, radio, outdoor and direct mail to broadly drive brand awareness. We advertise on local TV/Cable and local radio in our primary markets, and utilize local radio, print, internet advertising, and billboards for some of the less developed markets. We complement this with email marketing to our Raving Fan E-Club, which allows us to reach approximately 1,680,000 members, and via social media through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, which allows us to reach over 698,000 followers. We use our Raving Fan e-Club database to invite sub-sets of members to the taste panel facility, located at our corporate office. In September 2021, we launched our new Del Taco Mobile App, featuring enhanced marketing capabilities including a loyalty program and targeted promotional offers to drive guest frequency, which currently allows us to engage with approximately 540,000 registered users.
Through our public relations efforts, we engage notable food editors and bloggers on a range of topics to help promote products. In addition, we engage in one-on-one conversations using a portfolio of social media platforms which include Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We also use social media as a research and customer service tool, and apply insight we gain to future marketing efforts.
Purchasing and Distribution
To ensure an adequate supply of high-quality ingredients and other necessary supplies, we carefully select our suppliers. Our quality assurance department performs comprehensive supplier audits on a regular schedule to ensure that products conform to company standards. To ensure that prices are competitive, we use forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols where possible. We monitor industry news, trade issues, weather, political and world events that may affect supply prices, and we proactively attempt to lock in favorable pricing.
We contract with a single primary foodservice distributor for substantially all of our food and supplies. Our relationship with our primary distributor has been in place since 1990, and we believe the long-term relationship yields benefits to us and our franchisees in terms of reliability and pricing. Franchisees are required to use the primary distributor and must purchase all food and supplies from approved suppliers. In our normal course of business, we evaluate bids from multiple suppliers for various products. Taco meat is the largest product cost item and represented approximately 10% of the total cost for food and paper for 2021. Fluctuations in supply and prices can significantly impact our restaurant profit performance. We actively manage cost volatility for our significant food and paper items by negotiating with multiple suppliers and entering into what we believe are the most favorable contract terms given existing market conditions.
Intellectual Property
We have registered Del Taco®, Un freshing Believable®, Epic Burritos®, Beyond TacoTM and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in approximately nine foreign countries. In addition, the Del Taco logo, website name and domain name and the content on its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts are our intellectual property. We maintain the recipes for our taco meat, marinated grilled chicken and signature salsas, as well as certain proprietary standards, specifications and operating procedures, as trade secrets or confidential proprietary information.
We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees through franchise agreements. The franchise agreements restrict franchisees’ activities with respect to the use of the trademarks and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks. Our general policy is to pursue and maintain registration of the service marks, trademarks and other intellectual property rights we use for our business in those countries where business strategy requires us to do so and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks in such countries.
Competition
We operate in the restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains that may offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. The competition includes restaurants, convenience food stores, delicatessens, supermarkets and club stores. Based on our differentiated QSR+ positioning, we compete both with fast casual restaurants, including Chipotle, El Pollo Loco, Panera Bread, Qdoba, Rubio’s, and Habit, among others, and with traditional QSRs, such as Taco Bell, McDonald’s, Burger King and Jack In the Box. In addition, we compete with franchisors of other restaurant concepts for prospective franchisees.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including regulation of discharges into the air and water, storage and disposal of waste and clean-up of contaminated soil and groundwater. Under these laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances.
Certain of our properties may be located on sites that have been used by prior owners or operators as retail gas stations or other historical uses with the potential for environmental impacts. It is possible that properties on which our restaurants are located or which we owned in the past may contain forms of environmentally hazardous materials. We are aware of contamination from a release of hazardous materials by a previous owner, operator or adjacent business at four of our leased properties. We do not believe that we contributed to the contamination at these properties. The appropriate state agencies have been notified and these issues are being handled without disruption to our business. Under applicable federal and state environmental laws, the current owner or operator of these sites may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of any contamination. Although we lease almost all of our properties, when we own the property, we seek to obtain certain assurances from the prior owner or seek to obtain indemnity agreements from third parties. However, we cannot assure that we will not be liable for environmental conditions relating to prior, existing or future restaurants or restaurant sites. If we are found liable for the costs of remediation of contamination at or emanating from any of our properties, operating expenses would likely increase and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Regulation and Compliance
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, zoning and fire codes, and franchising. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any difficulties, delays or failures in this regard could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or adversely impact the viability of an existing restaurant.
The development and construction of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We believe existing laws and regulations in these areas have not had a material effect on us, but should such laws become more stringent or should we face different regulations in new territories, it could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants.
We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal, state, and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, overtime, paid sick leave, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. A significant portion of the hourly staff is paid at rates consistent with, or slightly above, the applicable federal, state or local minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage will increase labor costs.
For a discussion of the various risks we may face from regulation and compliance matters, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Management Information Systems and Cybersecurity
All of our company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants use Aloha, a leading computerized point-of-sale system, which we believe is scalable to support our long-term growth plans. This point-of-sale system provides integrated, high speed credit card and gift card processing, specifically designed for the restaurant industry. The system collects daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average transaction size that we actively analyze. It allows us to manage our products and pricing in restaurants from the corporate office.
Our in-restaurant back office computer system assists in the management of our restaurants and provides labor and food cost management tools. The system provides corporate office and restaurant operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the time spent on administration. The system also provides sales, bank deposit and variance data to the accounting department on a daily basis. For company-operated restaurants, we use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures. Restaurant managers also have the ability to submit food and paper orders electronically to our primary distributor. 
We have also successfully implemented a cloud-based workforce management system with a fully integrated payroll system which includes on-line recruiting tools, paperless employee files, labor scheduling and reporting, time keeping and an on-line training system. 
Our systems and data are protected by advanced communication and data security systems. We maintain a robust system of data protection and cyber security resources, technology and processes. We remain constantly vigilant of new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements and make strategic continued investment in those systems to keep company, customer and team member data secure. We provide annual security awareness training to our management.
Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information system planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. We provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and to the full Board of Directors periodically. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.
Human Capital
As of December 28, 2021, we had 7,274 employees, which includes 295 salaried general managers and 6,767 hourly restaurant employees comprised of 5,202 crewmembers, 1,434 shift leaders and 131 assistant managers. The remaining 212 employees were corporate office personnel or above restaurant level management. We do not have any employees represented by unions. While we partner with all our franchise business owners to foster a strong workforce culture, they are independent businesses with their own employees and are not included in this information. 
Across the enterprise, our decision making is guided by our company values. These values were developed through a series of restaurant and support center employee roundtables ensuring that our employees have a strong voice on “how” we do business. We believe that these values, and the culture that arises from them, allows us to attract and retain top talent enabling the brand to grow.
Culture
Fostering a people-first culture is a strategic priority for Del Taco. These efforts are guided through our PRIDE core values:
People Driven
Results Focused
Innovative Thinkers
Delighting our Guests
Elevating Others
These core values are instilled as part of our training for all new employees and are used as barometers when making key decisions for the brand. PRIDE is not just an acronym; our aim is for our employees to be proud of what they do every day as essential workers providing fresh food at a very affordable price to our guests. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We believe that the diversity we have sought and fostered in our workforce has played an integral role in our success. The atmosphere of inclusion and the feeling of being part of something bigger than ourselves is something we celebrate within our company. We view our responsibility to create an inclusive, equitable, safe and respectful workplace as one of our most critical objectives. To that end, our Operations leadership is regularly engaged with our Human Resource and our Risk Management teams to monitor for any potential workplace opportunities and works to continually enhance our approach on recruiting, training, communication and coaching to ensure we are living up to our values.
Based on the 2020 Black Box Workforce Intelligence Executive Scorecard for Del Taco, we were in the top 25th percentile in our industry segment for composite diversity of hourly employees and management. Based on that same Black Box report, we 
rank above average in the industry with women representing the majority of our General Manager leaders at the restaurants. We are committed to providing equitable opportunities for everyone to grow their career at Del Taco.
Oversight and Management
To ensure a positive workplace culture that lives up to our commitment on diversity, equality and employee safety, our Human Resources team provides oversight managing any employee-related issues. To clearly communicate our expectations and requirements related to our people, we have a written company Code of Conduct that is reviewed and acknowledged by all employees during onboarding. We also administer an Ethics Hotline where our employees can ask questions or raise concerns anonymously if they so choose. The hotline is available to all employees 24 hours a day. We established an Employee Relations Task force that is headed by select members of our senior leadership team. This group meets regularly to discuss employee-related challenges - with a recent focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Board of Directors also provides oversight on elements of our Human Capital strategy through governance vehicles like our Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the annual compensation plan and audits the attainment of goals tied to annual incentive compensation.
Development, Training & Engagement
We believe that time spent at Del Taco should be time well spent. Whether an employee is working a summer job or looking to build a career, we aim to provide the opportunity to learn and grow. This commitment shines through in our people development program that results in most of our operations management and operations support positions being filled through internal promotions. We conduct an annual employee survey to measure employee engagement and leverage the feedback to make improvements in the employee experience. Investing in the development of people and actively listening to our teams have been two of the essential building blocks of our commitment to people.
Benefits & Total Rewards
We offer competitive compensation to our hourly employees and provide additional benefits outside of their pay including free employee meals, discounted meals for family members, on-demand pay, a 401(k) plan and paid time-off. Healthcare is available to all our restaurant hourly employees who work a minimum of 30+ hours per week on average. For salaried employees, we offer competitive base compensation which is augmented by a 401(k) plan, core benefit programs supplemented with a variety of voluntary benefits, and a robust performance-based bonus program that has historically been paid to a high percentage of our salaried employees annually. 
COVID-19 
At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we set a demonstrative requirement to be a “Trusted & Safe” restaurant for both our teams and our guests. We have made several dozen changes to our operating systems to deliver on this requirement including providing personal protective equipment to employees, enhancing sanitation practices, administering employee wellness and temperature checks, providing gloves for all positions in the restaurant and installing counter/drive thru window shields. For our support center staff, we implemented our “Virtual Support Center” protocol enabling all employees to work from home. We also created a COVID-19 Hotline to allow employees to reach out with any COVID-related concerns or questions.
Additionally, we have gone above and beyond the government required paid time off laws and provided pay to workers who were impacted by COVID-19 either personally or due to close contact. Lastly, despite the closure of the majority of our dining rooms, we did not have any furloughs or layoffs in our restaurants. We remain highly committed to our “Trusted & Safe” approach and evaluate where we can improve via employee feedback and our guest experience measurement program.
