ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 The discussion of the business of Entravision Communications Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or Entravision or the Company, is as of the date of filing this report, unless otherwise indicated.
Overview 
 Introduction 
 We are a diversified global media, marketing and technology company that, through our television and radio segments, reaches and engages U.S. Hispanics across acculturation levels and media channels. Additionally, our digital segment, whose operations are located primarily in Spain and Latin America, reaches a global market. Our operations encompass integrated marketing and media solutions, comprised of television, radio and digital properties and data analytics services. For financial reporting purposes, we report in three segments based upon the type of advertising medium: television, radio and digital.
 We own and/or operate 54 primary television stations located primarily in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Washington, D.C. Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision television network and Univision’s UniMás network, with television stations in 19 of the nation’s top 50 U.S. Hispanic markets. According to Univision, which uses viewing data from Nielsen Holdings plc, or Nielsen, Univision’s primary network was set to finish 2020 as the number one Spanish-language network with total viewers 2+ and adults 18-49 for the 28th consecutive year, and among the top five broadcast networks, regardless of language, with adults 18-49 for the 17th consecutive year. Univision is a key source of programming for our television broadcasting business and we consider it to be a valuable strategic partner of ours. For a more complete discussion of our relationship with Univision, please see “Our Relationship with Univision” and “Television – Television Programming” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview”; and for a discussion of various risks related to our relationship with Univision, please see “Risk Factors.” 
 We own and operate one of the largest groups of primarily Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. We own and operate 48 radio stations in 16 U.S. markets. Our radio stations consist of 38 FM and 10 AM stations located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. We also sell advertisements and syndicate radio programming to more than 100 markets across the United States.
 We provide digital advertising solutions that allow advertisers to reach primarily Hispanic online audiences worldwide. We operate proprietary technology and data platforms that deliver digital advertising in various advertising formats that allow advertisers to reach audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices on our owned and operated digital media sites, the digital media sites of our publisher partners, and on other digital media sites we access through third-party platforms and exchanges.
 We generate revenue primarily from sales of national and local advertising time on television stations, radio stations and digital media platforms, retransmission consent agreements that are entered into with multichannel video programming distributors, or MVPDs, and agreements associated with our television stations’ spectrum usage rights. Advertising rates are, in large part, based on each medium’s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers. In our television and radio segments, we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast. In our digital segment, we recognize advertising revenue when display or other digital advertisements record impressions on the websites of our third party publishers or as the advertiser’s previously agreed-upon performance criteria are satisfied. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and, consequently, they may cancel, reduce or postpone orders without penalties. We pay commissions to agencies for local, regional and national advertising. For contracts we have entered into directly with agencies, we record net revenue from these agencies.
 We refer to the revenue generated by agreements with MVPDs as retransmission consent revenue, which represents payments from MVPDs for access to our television station signals so that they may rebroadcast our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. We recognize retransmission consent revenue earned as the television signal is delivered to an MVPD.

Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in our industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers. Our first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net revenue for the year. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during presidential election years (2020, 2024, etc.), and, to a lesser degree, Congressional mid-term election years (2022, 2026, etc.), resulting from increased political advertising in those years compared to other years. Advertising revenue in our radio segment is also generally higher during years when we broadcast the FIFA World Cup on our radio stations.
 Our licenses from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, grant us spectrum usage rights within each of the television markets in which we operate. These spectrum usage rights give us the authority to broadcast our stations’ over-the-air television signals to our viewers. We regard these rights as a valuable asset. With the proliferation of mobile devices and advances in technology that have freed up spectrum capacity, the monetization of our spectrum usage rights has become a significant source of revenue in recent years.  We generate revenue from agreements associated with these television stations’ spectrum usage rights from a variety of sources, including but not limited to agreements with third parties to utilize spectrum for the broadcast of their multicast networks; charging fees to accommodate the operations of third parties, including moving channel positions or accepting interference with our broadcasting operations; and modifying and/or relinquishing spectrum usage rights while continuing to broadcast through channel sharing or other arrangements.  Revenue generated by such agreements is recognized over the period of the lease or when we have relinquished all or a portion of our spectrum usage rights for a station or have relinquished our rights to operate a station on the existing channel free from interference.  In addition, subject to certain restrictions contained in our 2017 Credit Agreement, we will consider strategic acquisitions of television stations to further this strategy from time to time, as well as additional monetization opportunities expected to arise as the television broadcast industry implements the standards contained in ATSC 3.0.  
 Our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $344.0 million. Of this amount, revenue generated by our television segment accounted for approximately 45%, revenue generated by our digital segment accounted for approximately 42%, and revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for approximately 13%, of total revenue. 
 Our primary expenses are employee compensation, including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national sales representative firms, as well as expenses for general and administrative functions, promotion and selling, engineering, marketing, and local programming. Our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets. Cost of revenue related to our digital segment consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers and third party server costs. Direct operating expenses include salaries and commissions of sales staff, amounts paid to national representation firms, production and programming expenses, fees for ratings services, and engineering costs. Corporate expenses consist primarily of salaries related to corporate officers and back office functions, third party legal and accounting services, and fees incurred as a result of being a publicly traded and reporting company.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 2425 Olympic Boulevard, Suite 6000 West, Santa Monica, California 90404, and our telephone number is (310) 447-3870. Our corporate website is www.entravision.com. 
 We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company in January 1996 to combine the operations of our predecessor entities. On August 2, 2000, we completed a reorganization from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. On August 2, 2000, we also completed an initial public offering of our Class A common stock, which is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “EVC.” 
 Business Strategy 
 Our strategy is to reach Hispanic audiences primarily in the United States, Mexico and other markets in Latin America. We own and/or operate media properties in 14 of the 20 highest-density U.S. Hispanic markets. In addition, among the top 25 U.S. Hispanic markets, we own and/or operate media properties in 10 of the 15 fastest-growing markets. We believe that targeting the U.S. Hispanic market will continue to translate into revenue growth in the future, including for the following reasons: 

• | U.S. Hispanic Population Growth. Our audience consists primarily of Hispanics, one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. population and, by current U.S. Census Bureau estimates, now the largest minority group in the United States. More than 60 million Hispanics live in the United States, accounting for approximately 18% of the total U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The overall Hispanic population is growing at eight times the rate of the non-Hispanic population and is expected to grow to 69 million, or approximately 20% of the total U.S. population, by 2025. Approximately 62% of the total future growth in the U.S. population through 2025 is expected to come from the Hispanic community.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spanish-Language Use. Approximately 78% of Hispanics age five and over in the United States speak some Spanish, while approximately 64% of U.S. Hispanics age five and over are bilingual and 32% are Spanish dominant, according to Geoscape, a business unit of Claritas LLC, or Geoscape.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Increasing U.S. Hispanic Buying Power. The U.S. Hispanic population is projected to account for total consumer expenditures of over $978 billion in 2020, according to Geoscape. With an average expected household income of $74,000 in 2020, Hispanic household income is growing at a faster rate than non-Hispanic household income and is projected to reach an aggregate of $1.6 trillion in 2025.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attractive Profile of U.S. Hispanic Consumers. We believe that the demographic profile of the U.S. Hispanic audience makes it attractive to advertisers. We also believe that the larger average size and younger median age of Hispanic households (averaging 3.3 persons and 31.0 years of age as compared to the U.S. non-Hispanic averages of 2.4 persons and 42.8 years of age) lead Hispanics to spend more per household in many categories of goods and services. Although the average U.S. Hispanic household has less disposable income than the average non-Hispanic U.S. household, the average U.S. Hispanic household spends 3% more per year than the average U.S. non-Hispanic household on food at non-alcoholic beverages at home, 11% more on quick service restaurants, 32% more on children’s clothing, 21% more on footwear, 13% more on soaps, detergents and other cleaning products and 18% more on cellular phone services. We expect U.S. Hispanics to continue to account for a disproportionate share of growth in spending nationwide in many important consumer categories as the U.S. Hispanic population and its disposable income continue to grow.

• | Spanish-Language Advertising. According to Nielsen, over $7.3 billion of total advertising expenditures in the United States were placed with Spanish-language media in 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to increase our revenue through the following strategies: 
 Develop Unique and Compelling Content and Strong Brands While Effectively Using the Brands of Our Network Affiliates. We make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to license and create content for our television, radio and digital properties that is relevant and has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve.  
 Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision primary television network and Univision’s UniMás network. Univision reports that Univision and UniMás networks were scheduled to finish 2020 as the only two major broadcasters to increase their audience year-over-year in primetime among total viewers 2+ years of age, adults 18-49 and adults 18-34. In addition, according to Univision, it was set to finish 2020 as the number one Spanish-language network for the 28th consecutive year, and among the top five broadcast networks, regardless of language, with adults 18-49 for the 17th consecutive year and with total viewers 2+ years of age. Univision makes its networks’ Spanish-language programming available to our television stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including a prime time schedule on its primary network of substantially all first-run programming throughout the year. We believe that the breadth and diversity of Univision’s programming, combined with our local news and community-oriented segments, provide us with an advantage over other Spanish-language and English-language media in reaching U.S. Hispanic viewers. We design our local content in an effort to meet the needs of our communities and brand each of our stations as the best source for relevant community information that accurately reflects local interests and needs. 
 We format the programming of our radio networks and radio stations in an effort to capture a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in each of our radio markets. We operate each of our four radio networks – La Tricolor, La Suavecita, Fuego and José, Toca las de tu Rancho – using a format designed to appeal to different listener tastes. In markets where competing stations already offer programming similar to our network formats, or where we otherwise identify an available niche in the marketplace, we run alternative programming that we believe appeals to local listeners.
 Develop Local Content, Programming and Community Involvement. We believe that local content and service to the community in each of our markets is an important part of building our brand identity and providing meaningful local service within those markets. By combining our local news, local content and quality network programming, we believe that we have a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our active community involvement, including station remote broadcasting appearances at client events and concerts, which were restricted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and tie-ins to major events, helps to build company and station awareness and identity as well as viewer and listener loyalty. We also promote civic involvement and inform our listeners and viewers of significant developments affecting their communities.
 Distribute News and Other Content Across Our Television, Radio and Digital Properties. We develop our own Emmy® award-winning news, entertainment and lifestyle content, including a Sunday morning political talk show, “Política Ya with Tsi-Tsi-Ki Félix”. We also employ our own White House correspondent in Washington, D.C. We distribute this content across our television, radio and digital properties, including “Noticiasya.com”, our news website. In addition, through the Entravision Radio Network, we syndicate, distribute and sell some of our radio programs including “El Show de Piolin”, “The Shoboy Show” and “El Show de Alex ‘El Genio’ Lucas” across a network of more than 300 radio stations, which includes our radio stations as well as other radio stations that we do not own or operate, in more than 100 markets throughout the United States. We also broadcast, on an exclusive basis, and syndicate, National Football League, or NFL, games, including Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football, the NFL playoffs, including the Super Bowl, and the Pro Bowl, in Spanish, on 16 radio stations. We also broadcast Mexican National Soccer team matches through our partner Futbol de Primera, including a one-hour soccer program with general soccer updates and interviews, on 14 radio stations. We will also broadcast the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2022 FIFA World Cup on our radio stations.

Extend the Reach and Accessibility of Our Brands Through Our Digital Segment. In recent years, we have also expanded the distribution of our content through our digital platforms, such as the content we offer on the Internet and mobile phones. We believe that our digital segment offers opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to engage and share our content in new ways, while providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with them.
 Continuing to Offer Advertisers an Integrated Platform of Services. We believe that our diversified media portfolio provides us with a competitive advantage in targeting the Hispanic consumer. We offer advertisers the opportunity to reach potential customers through an integrated platform of services that includes television, radio and digital properties. Currently, we operate some combination of television and radio in 11 markets, which we sometimes refer to as combination markets, and, where possible, we also combine our television and radio operations, which have the effect of creating certain cost savings. In all of our markets, we believe that our digital platforms complement our television and/or radio operations in an effort to create value-added advertising opportunities for our advertisers.
 Continuing to Innovate and Invest in Technology and Data. We continue to make investments in our digital technology, including sales tools and research and development, to further increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our television and radio operations and digital advertising platforms.
 Monetize our Spectrum Assets. In recent years, with the proliferation of mobile devices and advances in technology that have freed up spectrum capacity, the monetization of our spectrum usage rights has become a significant source of revenue. We generate revenue from agreements associated with these television stations’ spectrum usage rights from a variety of sources, including but not limited to agreements with third parties to utilize spectrum for the broadcast of their multicast networks; charging fees to accommodate the operations of third parties, including moving channel positions or accepting interference with broadcasting operations; and modifying and/or relinquishing spectrum usage rights while continuing to broadcast through channel sharing or other arrangements. With more advances in technology, and the implementation of ATSC 3.0, we intend to continue to generate revenue from our spectrum assets. 
 Target Strategic Acquisitions and Investments.  We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. We believe that our knowledge of, and experience with, the U.S. Hispanic and global digital advertising marketplaces will enable us to identify acquisitions of television, radio and digital properties. Since our inception, we have used our management expertise, programming, local involvement and brand identity to improve our acquired media properties and audience reach. However, we are currently subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. Please see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. 
 Acquisition and Disposition Strategies 
 Historically, our acquisition strategy was focused on increasing our television and radio broadcasting presence in those markets in which we already compete, as well as expanding our operations into U.S. Hispanic markets where we do not own properties. We targeted fast-growing and high-density U.S. Hispanic markets. These included many markets in the southwestern United States, including Texas, California and various other markets along or near the United States/Mexico border. More recently, in order to enhance our product portfolio in our digital segment, we have focused our strategy more on acquisitions of high-growth digital advertising companies in new markets for us, such as Latin American and Europe.
 We plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to make future acquisitions as opportunities present themselves, both domestically and internationally, including digital companies, spectrum assets with high potential for future monetization, and additional media properties in markets that will enhance our offerings.  
 We are subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. We cannot at this time determine the effect that these limitations will have on our acquisition strategy or our overall business. Please see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”. 
 In addition, we periodically review our portfolio of media properties and, from time to time, have divested non-core assets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale. We are subject to certain limitations on divestitures under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. We cannot at this time determine the effect that these limitations will have on our disposition strategy or our overall business. Please see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

Our Relationship with Univision 
 Substantially all of our television stations are Univision- or UniMás-affiliated television stations. Our network affiliation agreement with Univision provides certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast Univision’s primary network and UniMás network programming in their respective markets.  Under the network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell no less than four minutes per hour of the available advertising time on stations that broadcast Univision network programming, and the right to sell approximately four and a half minutes per hour of the available advertising time on stations that broadcast UniMás network programming, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision. 
 Under the network affiliation agreement, Univision acts as our exclusive third-party sales representative for the sale of certain national advertising on our Univision- and UniMás-affiliate television stations, and we pay certain sales representation fees to Univision relating to sales of all advertising for broadcast on our Univision- and UniMás-affiliate television stations. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount we paid Univision in this capacity was $9.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively.
 We also generate revenue under two marketing and sales agreements with Univision, which give us the right to manage the marketing and sales operations of Univision-owned Univision affiliates in six markets – Albuquerque, Boston, Denver, Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C. 
 Under the current proxy agreement we have entered into with Univision, we grant Univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our Univision- and UniMás-affiliated television station signals. Among other things, the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by Univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with MVPDs. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, retransmission consent revenue accounted for approximately $36.8 million and $35.4 million, respectively, of which $26.8 million and $27.3 million, respectively, relate to the Univision proxy agreement. The term of the proxy agreement extends with respect to any MVPD for the length of the term of any retransmission consent agreement in effect before the expiration of the proxy agreement.
 On October 2, 2017, we entered into the current network affiliation agreement with Univision, which superseded and replaced our prior network affiliation agreements with Univision.  Additionally, on the same date, we entered into the current proxy agreement and current marketing and sales agreements with Univision, each of which superseded and replaced the prior comparable agreements with Univision.  The term of each of these current agreements expires on December 31, 2026 for all of our Univision and UniMás network affiliate stations, except that each current agreement will expire on December 31, 2021 with respect to our Univision and UniMás network affiliate stations in Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C.
 Univision currently owns approximately 11% of our common stock on a fully-converted basis. Our Class U common stock, all of which is held by Univision, has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors. Each share of Class U common stock is automatically convertible into one share of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends or combinations) in connection with any transfer of such shares of Class U common stock to a third party that is not an affiliate of Univision. In addition, as the holder of all of our issued and outstanding Class U common stock, so long as Univision holds a certain number of shares of Class U common stock, we may not, without the consent of Univision, merge, consolidate or enter into a business combination, dissolve or liquidate our company or dispose of any interest in any FCC license with respect to television stations which are affiliates of Univision, among other things. 
 Television 
 Overview 
 We own and/or operate Univision-affiliated television stations in 24 markets, including 19 of the top 50 Hispanic markets in the United States. Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision primary television network and Univision’s UniMás network. Univision’s primary network is available in approximately 79% of U.S. Hispanic television households, Univision reports that Univision and UniMás networks were scheduled to finish 2020 as the only two major broadcasters to increase their audience year-over-year in primetime among total viewers 2+ years of age, adults 18-49 and adults 18-34. In addition, according to Univision, it was set to finish 2020 as the number one Spanish-language network for the 28th consecutive year, and among the top five broadcast networks, regardless of language, with adults 18-49 for the 17th consecutive year and total viewers 2+. UniMás delivers the youngest network audience on broadcast television, regardless of language. We operate both Univision and UniMás affiliates in 20 of our 24 television markets. Univision’s networks make their Spanish-language programming available to our Univision-affiliated stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Univision’s prime time schedule on its primary network consists of substantially all first-run programming throughout the year.

Television Programming 
 Univision Primary Network Programming. Univision has publicly stated that it directs its programming primarily toward a young, family-oriented audience. It begins daily with Despierta America, a variety morning program, Monday through Friday, followed by novelas. In the late afternoon and early evening, Univision offers an entertainment magazine, a news magazine and national news, in addition to local news produced by our television stations. During prime time, Univision airs novelas, music specials and award shows. Prime time is followed by late news. Overnight programming consists primarily of repeats of programming aired previously on the network. Weekend daytime programming begins with children’s programming, and is generally followed by sports, reality, comedy shows and movies. 
 Approximately eight to ten hours of programming per weekday, including a substantial portion of weekday prime time, are currently programmed with novelas supplied primarily by Grupo Televisa, S.A. de C.V., or Televisa. Although novelas have been compared to daytime soap operas on the English-language television networks, the differences are significant. Novelas, originally developed as serialized books, have a beginning, middle and end, generally run five days per week and conclude three to eight months after they begin. Novelas also have a much broader audience appeal than soap operas, delivering audiences that contain large numbers of men, women, teens and children, unlike soap operas, whose audiences tend to be primarily women. 
 UniMás Network Programming. Univision has publicly stated that its other 24-hour general-interest Spanish-language broadcast network, UniMás, is programmed to meet the diverse preferences of the multi-faceted U.S. Hispanic community. UniMás’s programming includes sports (including boxing, soccer and a morning wrap-up at 6 a.m. similar to ESPN’s programming), movies (including a mix of English-language movies translated into Spanish) and novelas not run on Univision’s primary network, as well as reruns of popular novelas broadcast on Univision’s primary network. 
 Our Local Programming. We believe that our local news brands our stations in our television markets. We report our local news to relate to and inform our audiences. According to Nielsen, our early local news is ranked first or second among competing local newscasts regardless of language in its designated time slot in 10 of our television markets among adults 18-49 years of age, including ties, and in nine markets among adults 18-34 and adults 25-54 years of age, including ties. We have made substantial investments in people and equipment in order to provide our local communities with what we believe are quality newscasts. Our local newscasts have won numerous awards, and we strive to support the community in each of our local markets. For example, in 2020, we partnered with Children’s Miracle Network® in a radio event to raise money for local children’s hospitals and collaborated with the “Vota Conmigo 2020” public service campaign to reach out to newly naturalized Hispanic Americans to encourage them to register to vote. Moreover, in several of our markets, we believe that our local news is the only significant source of Spanish-language daily news for the Hispanic community. 
 Network Affiliation Agreements. Substantially all of our television stations are Univision- or UniMás-affiliated television stations. Our Univision network affiliation agreement provides certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast Univision’s primary network and UniMás network programming in their respective markets. The Univision network affiliation agreement expires in 2026, except that it expires in 2021 with respect to our Univision and UniMás network affiliate stations in Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C. Under the Univision network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell no less than four minutes per hour of the available advertising time on stations that broadcast Univision network programming, and the right to sell approximately four and a half minutes per hour of the available advertising time on stations that broadcast UniMás network programming, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision. 
 Our network affiliation agreements with HC2 Network Inc., or HC2, give us the right to broadcast Azteca America network programming on XHAS-TV, serving the Tijuana/San Diego market, and on the secondary program streams of KETF-CD, serving the Laredo market, and KVYE-TV, serving the Yuma-El Centro market, pursuant to at-will arrangements.
 Our network affiliation agreements with Fox Broadcasting Company, or Fox, give us the right to broadcast Fox network programming on KFXV-TV with simulcasts on KXFX-CD and KMBH-LD, each serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, and KXOF-CD, serving the Laredo market. These agreements expire on December 31, 2022.
 We also have agreements with Master Distribution Service, Inc., an affiliate of Fox, which give us the right to provide ten hours per week of MyNetworkTV network programming on KFXV-TV, KXOF-CD and KPSE-LD, provided that MDS has the right to terminate the agreement for KFXV-TV on 14 days’ notice. These agreements expire in September 2021 and may be extended for successive one-year periods by mutual consent of the parties. 
 Our network affiliation agreement with The CW Network, LLC, or CW, gives us the right to broadcast CW network programming through August 2021 on KCWT-CD and on the secondary program streams of KMBH-LD and KNVO-TV, each serving the Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, and on XHRIO-TV serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market. As a result of changes in regulations in Mexico, we were required to prepay the license fees for our 
 9


Mexico broadcast licenses for a period of 20 years. We elected not to make the required prepayment for station XHRIO-TV before the deadline to make such prepayment. As a result, we currently expect to stop broadcasting on this station at the end of the current license term, which expires on December 31, 2021.
 Our network affiliation agreement with NBCUniversal Media, LLC, or NBC, gives us the right to broadcast NBC network programming on KMIR-TV, serving the Palm Springs market, through December 31, 2021.
 Our network affiliation agreement with Multi Tele Ventas, S.A. de C.V., gives us the right to broadcast Milenio Televisión network programming on XDTV-TV, serving the Tijuana/San Diego market, pursuant to an at-will arrangement.
 Our affiliation agreement with Family Worship Center Church, Inc. gives us the right to broadcast SonLife network programming on WJAL-TV, serving the Washington, DC market, through June 2021.
 Our network affiliation agreement with LATV Networks, LLC, or LATV, gives us the right to broadcast LATV network programming on KTCD-LP, serving the San Diego market, and on secondary program streams of many of our other television stations. Either party may terminate the affiliation with respect to a given station 30 months after the launch of such station. Under the LATV network affiliation agreement, there are no fees paid for the carriage of programming, and we generally retain the right to sell approximately five minutes per hour of available advertising time. Walter F. Ulloa, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a director, officer and principal stockholder of LATV.
 We cannot guarantee that any of our current network affiliation agreements will be renewed beyond their respective expiration dates under their current terms, under terms satisfactory to us, or at all. We do not believe that the termination of any of our network affiliation agreements, other than the one with Univision, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 Marketing Agreements. Our marketing and sales agreements with Univision give us the right to manage the marketing and sales operations of Univision-owned Univision affiliates through 2021 in Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C. and through 2026 in Albuquerque, Boston and Denver. We have also entered into marketing and sales agreements with other parties in two of our other markets. 
 Long-Term Time Brokerage Agreements. We program each of XDTV-TV, serving the Tecate/San Diego market; XHAS-TV, serving the Tijuana/San Diego market; and XHRIO-TV, serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, under long-term time brokerage agreements. Under those agreements, in combination with certain of our Mexican affiliates and subsidiaries, we provide the programming and related services available on these stations, but the station owners retain absolute control of the content and other broadcast issues. These long-term time brokerage agreements expire in 2038, 2040 and 2045, respectively, and each provides for automatic, perpetual 30-year renewals unless both parties consent to termination. Each of these agreements provides for substantial financial penalties should the other party attempt to terminate prior to their respective expiration dates without our consent, and they do not limit the availability of specific performance as a remedy for any such attempted early termination. As a result of changes in regulations in Mexico, we were required to prepay the license fees for our Mexico broadcast licenses for a period of 20 years. We elected not to make the required prepayment for station XHRIO-TV before the deadline to make such prepayment. As a result, we currently expect to stop broadcasting on this station at the end of the current license term, which expires on December 31, 2021.

 Digital Television Technology. As we continue to enhance digital television transmission technology for our television stations, we are operating in an environment where we can decide the resolution and number of broadcast streams we provide in our over-the-air transmissions. Depending upon how high a resolution level at which we elect to transmit our programming, we have the potential to transmit over-the-air broadcast streams containing multiple program streams using the bandwidth authorized to each digital station. The transmission of such multiple programming streams is often referred to as multicasting. We currently are multicasting network programming streams, including LATV and other network programming streams, at most of our television stations, along with our primary network program streams. We periodically evaluate these multicasting operations as well as the amount of bandwidth we must allocate to our primary program streams and may consider either expanding or limiting our multicasting operations, or keeping these multicasting operations substantially as at present, in the future. We also continue to monitor developments in digital television technology. The ATSC sets the industry standards (including the current ATSC 1.0) for the technical operation of digital broadcast television stations. ATSC 3.0 is a major revision of the ATSC standards and comprises around 20 standards covering different aspects of the system. The industry standards are designed to offer support for newer technologies, that will allow enhanced video quality, datacasting capabilities, individualized advertising messages, and more robust mobile television support. Television industry observers believe that the combination of these functionalities will enable television broadcasters to engage successfully in new commercial endeavors, not previously available on broadcast television, such as targeted commercial advertising. The FCC has set regulations allowing broadcast stations to offer, on a voluntary basis, ATSC 3.0 services (which the FCC has called Next Gen TV).  In doing so, broadcast television stations must offer ATSC 3.0 services alongside a standard ATSC 1.0 digital signal and there will not be a mandatory transition.  We are considering how we will participate in the adoption of ATSC 3.0 technology and we are awaiting the development and sale of the necessary equipment to transmit and receive such broadcast signals, as well as how ATSC 3.0 is being adopted and accepted by viewers and advertisers.

Television Revenue 
 Approximately 72% of the revenue generated from our television operations in 2020 was derived from local and national advertising revenue, approximately 24% from retransmission consent revenue, and approximately 4% from spectrum usage rights. 
 National Advertising. National advertising revenue generally represents revenue from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from outside a station’s market. We typically engage national sales representative firms to work with our station sales managers and solicit national advertising sales, and we pay certain sales representation fees to these firms relating to national advertising sales. Under our network affiliation agreement with Univision, Univision acts as our sales representative for the sale of national advertising on our Univision and UniMás affiliate television stations, and advertisers which have purchased during 2020 national advertising on these affiliate stations include Charter Communications, Inc., Biden for President, Cox Communications, Inc., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., U.S. Census Bureau, Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc., Toyota Motor Corporation, Honda Motor Company, Ltd., Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. and Adventist Health System/West. Azteca America acts as our national sales representative for the sale of national advertising on our Azteca America affiliate station, and Katz Communications, Inc., or Katz, acts as our national sales representative for the sale of national advertising on KMIR-TV and KPSE-LD in the Palm Springs, California market and on our stations that broadcast Fox and CW programming. In 2020, national advertising accounted for approximately 42% of our total television revenue.
 Local Advertising. Local advertising revenue is generated predominantly from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from within a station’s market. Local advertising sales include sales to advertisers that are local businesses or advertising agencies, and regional and national businesses or advertising agencies, which place orders from within a station’s market or directly with a station’s local sales staff. We employ our own local sales force that is responsible for soliciting local advertising sales directly from advertisers and their agencies. In 2020, local advertising accounted for approximately 30% of our total television revenue. 
 Retransmission Consent Revenue. We generate retransmission consent revenue from retransmission consent agreements that are entered into with MVPDs. This revenue represents payments from these entities for access to our television station signals so that they may rebroadcast our signals on their services and charge their subscribers for this programming. In addition, we generally pay either a per subscriber fee to or share certain of the retransmission consent revenue received from MVPDs with the network providing the programming, which is known in the television industry as reverse network compensation. 
 Under our proxy agreement with Univision, we grant Univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our Univision- and UniMás-affiliated television station signals, which covers substantially all of our retransmission consent revenue. Among other things, the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by Univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with MVPDs. The term of the proxy agreement extends with respect to any MVPD for the length of the term of any retransmission consent agreement in effect before the expiration of the proxy agreement. On October 2, 2017, we entered into the current proxy agreement with Univision, which superseded and replaced the prior comparable agreement with Univision.  The term of the current proxy agreement expires on December 31, 2021 for our Univision and UniMás network affiliate stations in Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C, and on December 31, 2026 with respect to our Univision and UniMás network affiliate stations in Albuquerque, Boston and Denver. 
 As a result of provisions in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the Communications Act, we are not able to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with other television stations located in the same television market.  The application of this provision prevents us from negotiating with Univision in the six television markets where we and Univision both own television stations. We handle our negotiations directly with MVPDs in those markets where we and Univision are both station owners.
 In 2020, retransmission consent revenue accounted for approximately 24% of our total television revenue.
 Revenue from Spectrum Usage Rights. We generate revenue from agreements associated with our television stations’ spectrum usage rights from a variety of sources, including but not limited to entering into agreements with third parties to utilize spectrum for the broadcast of their multicast networks, charging fees to accommodate the operations of third parties, including moving channel positions or accepting interference from our broadcasting operations and modifying and/or relinquishing spectrum usage rights while continuing to broadcast through channel sharing or other arrangements.  Revenue from such agreements is recognized over the period of the programming agreements or when we have relinquished all or a portion of our spectrum usage rights for a station or have relinquished our rights to operate a station on the existing channel free from interference. In 2020, revenue from spectrum usage rights accounted for approximately 4% of our total television revenue.

Television Marketing/Audience Research 
 The relative advertising rates charged by competing stations within a market depend primarily on the following factors: 
  
• | the station’s ratings (households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of total television households or people in the viewing area);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | audience share (households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of households or people actually watching television at a specific time);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the demographic qualities of a program’s viewers (primarily age and gender);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the demand for available air time;

 Nielsen ratings provide advertisers with an industry-accepted measure of television viewing. Nielsen offers a ratings service measuring all television audience viewing. In recent years, Nielsen has modified the methodology of its ratings service in an effort to more accurately measure U.S. Hispanic viewing by using language spoken in the home as a control characteristic of its metered market sample. Nielsen has also added weighting by language as part of its local metered market methodology in many of our metered markets. Nielsen also continues to improve the methods by which it electronically measures television viewing, including using return path data, which is information acquired from MVPDs, and has expanded its Local People Meter service to several of our markets. We believe that these improvements will continue to result in more accurate ratings, allowing our advertisers to more precisely target our viewers. We have made significant investments in experienced sales managers and account executives and have provided our sales professionals with research tools to continue to attract major advertisers. 
 Television Competition 
 We face intense competition in the television broadcasting business. In each local television market, we compete for viewers and revenue with other local television stations, which are typically the local affiliates of the five principal English-language television networks, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox and the CW Network. In certain markets, we also compete for Spanish-language viewers with the local affiliates or owned and operated stations of Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network owned by Comcast Corporation, as well as the Azteca America network and other Spanish-language networks. Telemundo is an industry leader in the production and distribution of high-quality Spanish-Language content to U.S. Hispanics and audiences around the world. Telemundo’s multiple platforms include the Telemundo Network, a Spanish-language television network featuring original productions, theatrical motion pictures, news and sporting events. Several of the companies with which we compete have significantly greater resources and longer operating histories than we do.
 We also directly or indirectly compete for viewers and revenue with both English- and Spanish-language independent television stations, other video media (including streaming, mobile and on demand), suppliers of cable television network programs, direct broadcast satellite systems, newspapers, magazines, radio, software applications for mobile media devices, or apps, and other forms of entertainment and advertising. In certain markets we operate radio stations that indirectly compete for local and national advertising revenue with our television stations. Additionally, advertisers allocate finite advertising budgets across different media. We believe the advent of new technologies and services may result in continued emphasis by certain advertisers on these new technologies and services as compared to legacy media, such as television and radio. 
 We believe that our primary competitive advantages are the quality of the programming we receive through our affiliation with Univision and the quality of our local news programming. According to Nielsen, Univision’s primary network is the most-watched Spanish-language network in the United States during prime time among U.S. Hispanics. Similarly, our local news achieves strong audience ratings. Also, according to Nielsen, our early local news is ranked first or second among competing local newscasts regardless of language in its designated time slot in 10 of our television markets among adults 18-49 years of age, including ties, and in 9 markets among adults 18-34 and adults 25-54 years of age, including ties.

Digital 
 Overview
 We provide digital advertising solutions that allow advertisers to reach global online audiences, through operations that are located primarily in the United States, Spain, and Latin America. We operate proprietary technology and data platforms that deliver digital advertising in various advertising formats to allow advertisers to reach those audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices. Those platforms deliver advertising to our owned-and-operated digital sites, as well as third-party sites and apps, that contain digital advertising inventory, including those that we access directly through the owners of those sites and apps or through third-party platforms and exchanges. We access data from these digital media sites and apps and apply our data analytics capabilities to better target and aggregate audience segments that will be relevant to individual advertisers, while allowing the publishers of digital media sites and apps to better sell their digital advertising inventory.
Our Solutions and Technology Platforms
 We have developed a suite of digital advertising solutions, both organically and as a result of a series of acquisitions. Through these solutions, we offer advertisers the opportunity to reach and engage with their target audiences by providing access to digital inventory at scale across a wide range of Internet-connected devices. Our solutions include Cisneros Interactive (“Cisneros Interactive”), a business in which we have a majority interest, which maintains sales partnerships with some of the world’s leading digital publishers, including Facebook, Inc., or Facebook, Spotify AB and LinkedIn Corporation, in many countries in Latin America. In those markets, Cisneros Interactive supports advertisers and agencies in their local selling efforts, including by providing credit and local payment options.
 Our solutions also include the Smadex platform, which enables clients to purchase electronically and manage data-driven advertising campaigns. This practice – the purchase and sale of advertising inventory electronically – is referred to as programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising, in addition to being automated, also enables more precise audience targeting. Our other solutions include AudioEngage, a digital audio advertising platform hosting radio and music programming and podcasts; ScrollerAds, a programmatic seller of video advertising; Dataxpand, a data management platform allowing businesses to gain insights into consumer-related data; and our marketing solutions division for small and medium enterprises and national advertisers.
 Our ability to optimize the delivery of digital advertisements depends on our ability to successfully leverage data, including data that we collect from advertisers, publishers and third parties, as well as our own operating history. Using cookies and non-cookie based mechanisms, we collect information about the interactions of users with advertisers and publishers’ digital properties, including, for example, information about the placement of advertisements and users’ interactions with our clients’ websites or advertisements. Our ability to successfully leverage such data depends, in part, on our continued ability to access and use such data, which could be restricted by a number of factors, including new developments in, or new interpretations of, laws, regulations and industry standards, consumer choice, changes in technology, including changes in web browser technology, increased visibility of consent or “do not track” mechanisms or “ad-blocking” software, and restrictions imposed by large software companies and platform providers, web browser developers or other software developers. For example, mobile operating system and browser providers have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use data to target and measure advertising. Today, three major web browsers – Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox and Microsoft’s Edge – block third-party cookies by default. Google has introduced new controls over third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser and has announced plans to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by early 2022. Last year Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system that will reduce the ability to target and measure advertising.
 Our use of data, combined with our significant audience reach, access to a large volume of digital advertising space and broad array of advertising formats, allow us to deliver marketing solutions that can help grow our clients’ businesses. Through data analytics, we also enable advertisers to gain insights into the performance of their advertising campaigns and manage those campaigns with a view toward maximizing return on their advertising investment. 
 We believe that key benefits of our digital advertising solutions include the following:
 Sophisticated targeting. Our platforms and solutions specifically identify and reach online audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices. 
 We believe that one of the main strengths of our platforms is that they can access and analyze large amounts of data in order to provide a multidimensional view of individual consumer profiles on an anonymous basis. This understanding allows advertisers to reach and engage consumers more effectively.
 We have also developed a number of audience categories to which advertisers can target their advertisements. Audience categories can be based on a variety of user attributes, including location, demographics, affluence, intent, gender and interests. We identify these attributes and audience categories based upon information we have gathered about online users’ online activity on an 
 15


anonymous basis, a process known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. We analyze these data to build sophisticated user profiles and audience groups that, in combination with our data analytics and the real-time decision-making, optimization and targeting capabilities of our platform, enable us to deliver highly targeted advertising campaigns for our advertiser clients, as well as analytics to help them better understand audiences and consumers. As we deliver more advertisements, we are able to collect additional information about users, audiences and the effectiveness of particular advertising campaigns, which in turn enhances our targeting capabilities and allows us to deliver better performance for advertisers and better opportunities for our publisher partners to increase their revenue streams. In addition, advertisers are willing to pay a higher rate for digital advertising when more detailed consumer data can be used to help them make their decisions about purchasing advertising and to engage with the consumers whom they desire to reach. 
 Premium content. We provide our advertiser clients with access to premium digital content, which is professionally produced and we believe offers a quality viewing experience, through our owned and operated digital media sites and those of our publisher partners. This enables publishers to more effectively monetize their digital content, and enables advertisers to more effectively reach audiences who engage with such premium content.
 Scale and reach across a range of Internet-connected devices. We enable advertisers to use our digital media advertising solutions to address their online and mobile advertising needs in seeking to reach their desired audiences at scale across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, including computers, smartphones and tablets.
 Variety of advertising formats. We enable advertisers to deliver a variety of online and mobile advertising formats, including video advertisements, display banners, rich media and native advertising formats. We believe that these advertising formats provide an opportunity for advertisers to create a variety of advertising content that increases audience interaction and engagement, which in turn drives better results for advertisers.
 Brand safety. Our proprietary technology contextually evaluates the content of digital media sites on which we deliver advertisements in order to identify content that is most appropriate or desirable for an individual advertiser, and also ensure that advertisements are not being delivered within content that is identified as objectionable to the advertiser, such as content that contains distasteful or obscene language, violence, gambling, sex or criminal activity, which we refer to as brand safety. We believe that the combination of our practice of selecting publisher partners and our proprietary technology provides a high level of brand safety for our advertisers.
 Digital Advertising
 We provide our advertiser clients with opportunities to reach their target audiences through brand advertising and performance-based advertising. Brand advertising is generally intended to establish a long-term, positive consumer attitude toward an advertiser or its products or services, and brand advertisers typically measure campaign effectiveness using metrics such as reach (how many consumers within the advertiser’s target audience were exposed to the advertisement) and frequency (how many times the consumer within the target audience was exposed to the advertisement). Performance-based advertising is generally intended to induce a specific action, such as clicking on an advertisement, and direct response advertisers typically measure campaign effectiveness using metrics related to consumer response to a particular advertisement. 
 We generate digital revenue by delivering digital advertisements on digital media sites across a wide range of Internet-connected devices. Advertisers and agencies typically purchase advertising from us through campaigns that are sold and managed by our direct sales force, which we refer to as managed campaigns. Managed campaigns provide advertisers with a higher degree of “white glove” customer service, with dedicated account teams that use an automated platform to deliver advertising campaigns for advertisers.
 We typically contract with advertisers or agencies through insertion orders, which set forth campaign parameters such as size and duration of the campaign, type of advertising format and pricing. Digital advertisers and their agencies submit advertising insertion orders to us and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital advertisements to audiences through digital media properties. We are typically paid by advertisers on the basis of the number of viewer impressions occurring when an advertisement is delivered, known as a cost per thousand basis, or on the basis of the number or type of actions taken by viewers to whom an advertisement is delivered, known as a cost per action basis. We generally pay our publisher partners a negotiated percentage of this revenue. Prior to running an advertising campaign, the advertiser or agency may work with our creative team to provide the creative direction of the campaign and design in order to most effectively reach the audiences most desirable to it.
 Our Digital Customers
 Our digital customer base consists primarily of advertisers of all sizes and the advertising agencies that represent them. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had over 3,000 advertising clients, including top brand advertisers from nearly all major industries, 
 16


including e-commerce, entertainment, gaming, delivery services, financial technology, communications, lifestyle, and travel. We do not believe that our business is substantially dependent upon any individual advertiser or industry.
 Our Digital Publisher Network
 We have contractual relationships with premium publishers, or owners of sites that contain premium digital content and provide digital advertising inventory. We consider a premium publisher to be a publisher that has content that is professionally produced and offers a quality viewing experience. These relationships provide us with digital advertising inventory, which we utilize to deliver our digital advertising solutions to our digital advertising customers. We engage our publisher partners through a variety of methods, including outreach by a dedicated business development team. We do not believe that the success of our business is dependent on our relationship with any single publisher partner. 
 We seek to identify owners of digital media properties featuring premium digital content that, individually or collectively, have the audience scale, composition and accessibility across Internet-connected devices to achieve the objectives of our advertisers. We review a variety of criteria to determine the quality of the advertising inventory and its appropriateness for our advertiser clients, including content, the characteristics of the publisher’s viewing audience, the targeting attributes that can be obtained from the digital media property in real time and the volume of available digital content and impressions. 
 Digital Competition
 The digital advertising market is dynamic, rapidly changing and highly competitive, influenced by frequent technological advances, trends in both the overall advertising and digital advertising markets and changing customer perceptions and expectations. We compete with many very large online digital companies, including Facebook and Google, Inc., as well as other publishers who attract advertisers to their digital offerings, as well as other advertising technology companies and advertising networks. In the television and radio broadcast space, our digital operations also compete for advertising commitments with television broadcasters, cable television networks, radio broadcasters, print media and other traditional publishers. Many of our competitors in this space have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and/or longer operating histories than we have. Moreover, as many advertisers seek automation and enhanced targeting of increasingly fragmented audiences, they are moving a greater percentage of their advertising budgets to programmatic channels. As a result, we face more competition from online digital companies that have allocated resources to the automated buying and selling of advertising inventory through traditional channels, like desktop and new and developing channels, including mobile.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in digital media include effective audience targeting capabilities, multi-device campaign delivery capability, proven and scalable technologies, audience scale and reach, relationships with leading advertisers and their respective agencies, brand awareness and reputation, ability to gather and use data to deliver more relevant advertisements, ability to ensure brand safety, ability to prevent click fraud, use of analytics to effectively measure performance and ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies that both respond to, and influence, consumer expectations. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well-positioned to be a leading provider of digital advertising solutions to reach audiences globally.
 Radio 
 Overview 
 We own and operate 48 radio stations (38 FM and 10 AM), 45 of which are located in the top 50 Hispanic markets in the United States, and we operate the Entravision Radio Network, through which we sell advertisements and provide syndicated radio programming to more than 100 markets across the United States. According to Nielsen, our radio stations broadcast into markets with an aggregate of approximately 22 million U.S. Hispanics, which is approximately 36% of the Hispanic population in the United States.  Our radio operations combine network and local programming with local time slots available for advertising, news, traffic, weather, promotions and community events. This strategy allows us to provide quality programming with significantly lower costs of operations than we could otherwise deliver solely with all locally produced programming. 
Radio Programming 
 Radio Networks. Our networks allow advertisers with national product distribution to deliver a uniform advertising message to the growing Hispanic market around the country in an efficient manner. 
 Although our networks have a broad geographic reach, technology allows our stations to offer the necessary local feel and to be responsive to local clients and community needs. Designated time slots are used for local advertising, news, traffic, weather, promotions and community events. The audience gets the benefit of a national radio sound along with local content. To further enhance this effect, our on-air personalities frequently travel to participate in local promotional events, although such travel has been 
 17


restricted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in selected key markets our on-air personalities appear at special events and client locations. We promote these events as “remotes” to bond the national personalities to local listeners. Furthermore, all of our stations can disconnect from their networks and operate independently in the case of a local emergency or a problem with our central Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS, transmission. 
 Radio Formats. Each of our four radio networks produce a music format that is simultaneously distributed via MPLS with a high definition quality sound to our stations. Each of these formats appeals to different listener preferences:

Radio Advertising 
 Substantially all of the revenue generated from our radio operations is derived from local and national advertising. 
 Local. Local advertising revenue is generated predominantly from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from within a station’s market. Local advertising sales include sales to advertisers that are local businesses or advertising agencies, and regional and national businesses or advertising agencies, which place orders from within a station’s market or directly with a station’s sales staff. We employ our own local sales force, in each of our markets, that is responsible for soliciting local advertising sales directly from advertisers and their agencies. In 2020, local advertising revenue accounted for approximately 60% of our total radio revenue. 
 National. National advertising revenue generally represents spot and network revenue from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from outside a station’s market. Since January 2020, Katz has acted as our national sales representative to solicit national spot advertising sales on all of our radio stations, and we act as our own network sales representative. Prior to January 2020, Entravision Solutions, one of our divisions, typically acted as our national sales representative to solicit national advertising sales on our Spanish-language radio stations. In 2020, national advertising revenue accounted for approximately 40% of our total radio revenue. 
Radio Marketing/Audience Research 
 We believe that radio is an efficient means for advertisers to reach targeted demographic groups. Advertising rates charged by our radio stations are based primarily on the following factors: 

• | the particular station’s ratings (people listening to its programs as a percentage of total people in the listening area);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | audience share (people listening to its programs as a percentage of people actually listening to radio at a specific time);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the demographic qualities of a program’s listeners (primarily age and gender);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the demand for available airtime;
--+----------------------------------


• | the time of day that the advertising runs;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | competitive conditions in the station’s market;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | changes in advertising choices and placements in different media, such as new media, compared to traditional media such as television and radio; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economic conditions, including advertisers’ budgetary considerations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nielsen Audio provides advertisers with the industry-accepted measure of listening audience classified by demographic segment and time of day that the listeners spend on particular radio stations. Radio advertising rates generally are highest during the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. These hours are considered the peak times for radio audience listening. 
 Historically, advertising rates for Spanish-language radio stations have been lower than those for English-language stations with similar audience levels. We believe that, over time, possibilities exist to narrow the disparities that have historically existed between Spanish-language and English-language advertising rates as new and existing advertisers recognize the growing desirability of the U.S. Hispanic population as an advertising target. For example, U.S. Hispanics spend more on food at home than the national average. We also believe that having multiple stations in a market enables us to provide listeners with alternatives, to secure a higher overall percentage of a market’s available advertising dollars, and to obtain greater percentages of individual customers’ advertising budgets.
 Each station broadcasts an optimal number of advertisements each hour, depending upon its format, in order to maximize the station’s revenue without jeopardizing its audience listenership. Our non-network stations have up to 14 minutes per hour for commercial inventory and local content. Our network stations have up to one additional minute of commercial inventory per hour. The pricing is based on a rate card and negotiations subject to the supply and demand for the inventory in each particular market and the network. 
 20


Radio Competition
We face intense competition in the radio broadcasting business. The financial success of each of our radio stations and markets depends in large part on our audience ratings, our ability to maintain and increase our market share of overall radio advertising revenue and the economic health of the market and the nation. In addition, our advertising revenue depends upon the desire of advertisers to reach our audience demographic. Each of our radio stations competes for audience share and advertising revenue directly with both Spanish-language and English-language radio stations in its market, and with other media, such as newspapers, broadcast, cable, satellite and streaming television, magazines, outdoor advertising, satellite-delivered radio services, apps, podcasts and other forms of digital audio delivery, and direct mail advertising. In addition, in certain markets we operate television stations that indirectly compete for local and national advertising revenue with our radio business. Our primary competitors in our markets in Spanish-language radio are Univision, iHeartMedia Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications Inc.) and Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. These and many of the other companies with which we compete are companies that have significantly greater resources and longer operating histories than we do. 
 Factors that are material to our competitive position include management experience, a station’s audience rank in its market, signal strength and coverage, and audience demographics. If a competing station within a market converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors upgrades its stations, we could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue in that market. The audience ratings and advertising revenue of our individual stations are subject to fluctuation and any adverse change in certain of our key radio markets could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 The radio industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as: 
  
• | audio programming available on cable television systems, broadcast satellite-delivered audio services, over-the-top, or OTT, services on Internet-connected televisions, Internet content providers, streaming audio available over mobile devices via multiple platforms, including easy-to-use mobile apps, podcasts, smart speakers and other digital audio broadcast formats and playback mechanisms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satellite- and internet protocol network-delivered digital audio services—with both commercial-free and lower commercial load channels—which have expanded their subscriber base and have introduced dedicated Spanish-language channels and linear streams of over-the-air radio stations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In-Band On-Channel™ digital radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional high definition FM radio services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advertisers allocate finite advertising budgets across different media. We believe that the advent of new technologies and services may result in continued emphasis by certain advertisers on these new technologies and services as compared to legacy media, such as radio. Accordingly, while we also believe that none of these new technologies and services can completely replace local broadcast radio stations due to the element of localism that broadcast radio offers, the challenges we face in our radio operations from new technologies and services will continue to require attention from management. Among other things, we intend to leverage potential opportunities to adopt new technologies in our radio operations where appropriate, including digital streaming and podcasting, such as “El Botón”. We cannot guarantee that such adoption of new technologies, if any, will adequately address the challenges we face in our radio operations.
 Seasonality
 Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in television and radio broadcasting and digital media, and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. In our television and radio segments, our second and third fiscal quarters generally produce the highest net revenue for the year. In our digital segment, net revenue generally increases in each fiscal quarter over the course of the year. In addition, advertising revenue across our segments is generally higher during presidential election years (2020, 2024, etc.) and, to a lesser degree, Congressional mid-term election years (2022, 2026, etc.), resulting from increased political advertising in those years compared to other years. Advertising revenue in our radio segment is also generally higher during years when we broadcast the FIFA World Cup on our radio stations.
 21


Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our ability to protect our intellectual property is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trade secrets law, copyrights, trademarks and contracts. We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality and security of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. While we believe that such measures are generally effective, we cannot guarantee that such measures will adequately protect our intellectual property from use, misuse or infringement by others.
 In the course of our business, we use various trademarks, trade names and service marks, including our logos and FCC call letters, in our advertising and promotions, as well as proprietary technology platforms and other technology. Some of our technology relies upon third party licensed intellectual property. We do not hold or depend upon any material patent, government license, franchise or concession, except for our broadcast licenses granted by the FCC. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,001 full-time employees worldwide.  Approximately 607 of those full-time employees were in the United States, including 439 full-time employees in our television segment, 146 full-time employees in our radio segment and 22 full-time employees in our digital media segment. As of December 31, 2020, three of our full-time television segment employees in the United States were represented by a labor union that has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us. 
 We had 28 full-time employees in Mexico in our television segment as of December 31, 2020, of whom eight were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. That agreement was most recently renewed on January 1, 2020 for a term of two years.
 In our digital segment, we had 120 full-time employees in Argentina, 92 full-time employees in Spain, 32 full-time employees in Uruguay, 22 full-time employees in Mexico, 20 full-time employees in Brazil, 19 full-time employees in Colombia, 10 full-time employees in Peru, eight full-time employees in Guatemala, eight full-time employees in Bolivia, seven full-time employees in Chile, seven full-time employee in Costa Rica, six full-time employees in Israel, six full-time employees in Dominican Republic, five full-time employees in Ecuador, and four full-time employees in Panama, as of December 31, 2020. Sixty of these employees are members of a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 We believe that our relations with our employees and these unions are generally good.
 Human Capital Management
 We are a global company, and as a result we endeavor to have a diverse and inclusive workforce reflective of our international footprint. While we do not employ specific human capital measures in our business, we are committed to the overall health, safety and wellness of our employees globally. We offer our employees various health and wellness benefits, which we believe provide a sense of security. We also offer career growth and development opportunities. For example, we make available to our sales team, on a global basis, training to enhance their job-related skills.
 We are committed to providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation. We have a strict policy prohibiting sexual harassment, as well as harassment or discrimination based on race, gender and other specified statuses and conditions. Unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical and visual conduct, threats, demands and retaliation, is prohibited. We have established hotline and anonymous complaint processes for any employee who believes that these policies have been violated.
 Our overall commitment to our employees has extended to the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented a work-from-home policy for many of our employees, which policy we believe has delivered a sense of safety. We also adopted additional safety measures for our employees who do not work from home, including our employees who provide essential services on-site. These measures include distancing and masking requirements, office cleaning procedures, communications regarding our policies and procedures related to the pandemic, and limiting non-essential travel.
 Regulation of Television and Radio Broadcasting 
 General. The FCC regulates television and radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act. Among other things, the FCC: 
  
• | determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of stations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | issues, renews, revokes and modifies station licenses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 22



 
• | regulates equipment used by stations; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, changes in ownership, control, operation and employment practices of stations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A licensee’s failure to observe the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of renewal terms of less than eight years, the grant of a license renewal with conditions or, in the case of particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. 
 Congress and the FCC have had under consideration or reconsideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our television and radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our television and radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional television and radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters may include: 
  
• | changes to the license authorization process;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to impose a performance tax on the music broadcast on commercial radio stations and the fees applicable to digital transmission of music on the Internet;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free airtime to candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals dealing with the broadcast of profane, indecent or obscene language and the consequences to a broadcaster for permitting such speech;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | technical and frequency allocation to broadcast services and usage matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | modifications to the operating rules for digital television and radio broadcasting rules on both satellite and terrestrial bases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the implementation or modification of rules governing the carriage of local television signals by direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, services and cable television systems and the manner in which such parties negotiate such carriage arrangements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in local and national broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution rules;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the procedures whereby full-service broadcast stations are carried on MVPDs (cable television and direct-broadcast satellite systems) either on a must-carry or retransmission consent basis and how compensation systems and negotiating processes involving broadcasters and MVPDs might be modified;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to modify the regulation of telephone and text messaging-based marketing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the operating rules and policies for AM and FM broadcasting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted, nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future, nor can we judge in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposal or change might have on our business. 
 23


FCC Licenses. Television and radio stations operate pursuant to licenses that are granted by the FCC for a term of eight years, subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. During the periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. The FCC may hold hearings on renewal applications if it is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a “substantial and material question of fact” as to whether the grant of the renewal applications would be inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. However, the FCC is prohibited from considering competing applications for a renewal applicant’s frequency, and is required to grant the renewal application if it finds: 
  
• | that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If as a result of an evidentiary hearing the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements for renewal and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, the FCC may deny a license renewal application. Historically, FCC licenses have generally been renewed. We have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed in the ordinary course, although there can be no assurance to that effect. The non-renewal of one or more of our stations’ licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Ownership Matters. The Communications Act requires prior consent of the FCC for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license. In determining whether to approve an assignment of a television or radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests therein, and the Communications Act’s limitations on foreign ownership and compliance with the FCC rules and regulations. 
 To obtain the FCC’s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. If the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer or acquisition of more than 50% of the voting equity, the application must be placed on public notice for a period of 30 days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. If an assignment application does not involve new parties, or if a transfer of control application does not involve a “substantial” change in ownership or control, it is a pro forma application, which is not subject to the public notice and 30-day petition to deny procedure. The regular and pro forma applications are nevertheless subject to informal objections that may be filed any time until the FCC acts on the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, interested parties have 30 days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant. The FCC has an additional ten days to set aside such grant on its own motion. When ruling on an assignment or transfer application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application. 
 Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not, absent a public interest determination by the FCC, be granted to or held by persons who are not U.S. citizens, by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives or by non-U.S. corporations. Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of its capital stock is owned of record or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, or foreign governments or their representatives or by non-U.S. corporations. The FCC, recognizing its authority to allow foreign ownership in excess of these safe harbor levels and to allow for greater foreign investment in domestic broadcast media, has established new policies and practices allowing broadcast licensees to file petitions for declaratory ruling requesting approval (i) of up to and including 100% aggregate foreign ownership by unnamed and future foreign investors in the controlling U.S. parent of a broadcast licensee, (ii) for any named foreign investor who proposes to acquire less than 100% controlling interest to increase the interest to 100% in the future, and (iii) for any non-controlling named foreign investor to increase its interest up to 49.99% in the future.  The new rules also establish that a broadcast licensee only needs to obtain specific approval for foreign investors holding more than 5% interest, and in certain circumstances more than 10% interest, in the U.S. parent of the broadcast licensee, or a controlling interest in the U.S. parent. The licenses for our stations could be revoked if our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non-U.S. citizens in excess of these limitations or in violation of the procedures adopted by the FCC. Our restated certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership and voting of our capital stock to enable us to comply with foreign ownership limitations. 
 The FCC generally applies its other broadcast ownership limits to “cognizable” interests held by an individual, corporation or other association or entity. In the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the stock of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests, as are positions as an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee. 
 24


Stock interests held by insurance companies, mutual funds, bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses. 
 A time brokerage agreement with another television or radio station in the same market creates an attributable interest in the brokered television or radio station as well for purposes of the FCC’s local television or radio station ownership rules, if the agreement affects more than 15% of the brokered television or radio station’s weekly broadcast hours. Likewise, a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) involving radio stations creates a similar attributable interest for the broadcast station that is undertaking the sales function. As for television stations, the FCC adopted and then eliminated the practice of attribution for television JSAs, in its quadrennial ownership proceeding that is subject to judicial review. The action involving the elimination of attribution for television stations was an issue in the judicial review of the FCC’s 2014 Quadrennial Review of media ownership provisions.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, or the Third Circuit, reversed and remanded the FCC’s decision.  The FCC and a broadcast industry group successfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, and oral argument was held in January, 2021, with a decision expected to be rendered by July 1, 2021.  Until the U.S. Supreme Court decides the case, we cannot determine the impact of any decision on our business.
 Debt instruments, non-voting stock, options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised, insulated limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership and minority voting stock interests in corporations where there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock whose vote is sufficient to affirmatively direct the affairs of the corporation generally do not subject their holders to attribution. 
 However, the FCC also applies a rule, known as the equity-debt-plus rule, which causes certain creditors or investors to be attributable owners of a station, regardless of whether there is a single majority stockholder or other applicable exception to the FCC’s attribution rules. Under this rule, a major programming supplier (any programming supplier that provides more than 15% of the station’s weekly programming hours) or a same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the equity-debt-plus rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and equity held by insulated limited partners in limited partnerships. Debt includes all liabilities, whether long-term or short-term. 
 Under the ownership rules currently in place, the FCC generally permits an owner to have only one television station per market. In certain markets, a single owner is permitted to have two stations with overlapping signals so long as they are assigned to different markets. The FCC’s rules regarding ownership permit, however, an owner to operate two television stations assigned to the same market, in markets where that is otherwise permissible, so long as either: 
  
• | the television stations do not have overlapping broadcast signals; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there will remain after the transaction eight independently owned, full power noncommercial or commercial operating television stations in the market and one of the two commonly-owned stations is not ranked in the top four based upon audience share.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FCC will consider waiving these ownership restrictions in certain cases involving failing or failed stations or stations which are not yet built. 
 The FCC permits a television station owner to own one radio station in the same market as its television station. In addition, a television station owner is permitted to own additional radio stations, not to exceed the local radio ownership limits for the market, as follows: 
  
• | in markets where 20 media voices will remain, a television station owner may own an additional five radio stations, or, if the owner only has one television station, an additional six radio stations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in markets where ten media voices will remain, a television station owner may own an additional three radio stations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A “media voice” includes each independently-owned and operated full-power television and radio station and each daily newspaper that has a circulation exceeding 5% of the households in the market, plus one voice for all cable television systems operating in the market. 
 The FCC rules also impose a limit on the number of television stations a single individual or entity may own nationwide. 
 25


The number of radio stations an entity or individual may own in a radio market is as follows: 
  
• | In a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50% of the radio stations in such market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of these multiple and cross-ownership rules, if one of our stockholders, officers or directors holds a “cognizable” interest in our company, such stockholder, officer or director may violate the FCC’s rules if such person or entity also holds or acquires an attributable interest in other television or radio stations or daily newspapers in such markets, depending on their number and location. If an attributable stockholder, officer or director of our company violates any of these ownership rules, we may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct our broadcast business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 
 Among the actions ultimately taken by the FCC were ones to eliminate the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, eliminate the radio-television cross-ownership rule, eliminate the so-called “eight voices” test that made it difficult to own more than one station in a smaller market, and to allow for a case-by-case review of the prohibition on ownership of the two of the top four stations in a market. As previously discussed, the rules changes are now before the U.S. Supreme Court, following the Third Circuit’s decision reversing the FCC’s actions. A new Quadrennial Review was commenced in late 2018 and has not yet resulted in any definitive action on the FCC’s part.
 The rule changes that have previously gone into effect amend the FCC’s methodology for defining a radio market for the purpose of ownership caps. The FCC replaced its signal contour method of defining local radio markets in favor of a geographic market assigned by Nielsen Audio, the private audience measurement service for radio broadcasters. For non-Nielsen Audio markets, the FCC applies a “modified contour approach”. This modified approach excludes any radio station whose transmitter site is more than 58 miles from the perimeter of the mutual overlap area. As for newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership, the FCC adopted a presumption that newspaper-broadcast ownership is consistent with the public interest in the top 20 television markets, while the presumption, in smaller markets, is that such cross-ownership is not consistent with the public interest, subject to certain exceptions. The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership limitation is another provision being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in its review process.
 With regard to the national television ownership limit, the FCC increased the national television ownership limit to 45% from 35%. Congress subsequently enacted legislation that reduced the nationwide cap to 39%. Accordingly, a company can now own television stations collectively reaching up to a 39% share of U.S. television households. Limits on ownership of multiple local television stations still apply, even if the 39% limit is not reached on a national level. 
 In establishing a national cap by statute, Congress did not make mention of the FCC’s UHF discount policy, whereby UHF stations are deemed to serve only one-half of the population in their television markets. The FCC had abolished its UHF discount policy, but grandfathered ownership interests in place at the time of the decision. However, that decision was reconsidered by the FCC and the UHF discount policy was reinstated. The FCC is now undertaking a proceeding to determine whether and how to apply the UHF discount policy as digital stations operating in the UHF mode do not face any operational problems in transmitting their signals to their broadcast markets.
 The FCC has previously decided that Univision’s television station interests are attributable to certain of our television interests in determining the television interests we must count for local and national multiple ownership purposes. In addition, the FCC, as previously noted, has commenced a rulemaking process to consider both the nationwide cap and the UHF discount. Should the UHF discount be eliminated or the nationwide cap be interpreted to treat all stations on an equal basis, we may, in the absence of retroactive applicability, which the FCC customarily does not apply, have to divest stations or be limited in our ability to acquire additional television stations.
 The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a broadcast station’s community of license. Nevertheless, a broadcast licensee continues to be required to present programming in 
 26


response to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from the public about a broadcast station’s programming when it evaluates the licensee’s renewal application, but complaints also may be filed and considered at any time. Stations also must follow various FCC rules that regulate, among other things, political broadcasting, the broadcast of profane, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operations. 
 The FCC requires that licensees must not discriminate in hiring practices. It has adopted rules that require us to adhere to certain outreach practices when hiring personnel for our stations and to keep records of our compliance with these requirements. The FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO, rules set forth a three-pronged recruitment and outreach program for companies with five or more full-time employees that requires the wide dissemination of information regarding full-time vacancies, notification to requesting recruitment organizations of such vacancies, and a number of non-vacancy related outreach efforts such as job fairs and internships. Stations are required to collect various information concerning vacancies, such as the number filled, recruitment sources used to fill each vacancy, and the number of persons interviewed for each vacancy. While stations are not required to routinely submit information to the FCC, stations must place an EEO report containing vacancy-related information and a description of outreach efforts in their public file annually. Stations must submit the preceding two years of their annual EEO public file report as part of their renewal applications. Stations also must place their EEO public file report on their Internet websites, if they have one. The EEO rules do not materially affect our operations. Failure to comply with the FCC’s EEO rules could result in sanctions or the revocation of station licenses. 
 The FCC rules have prohibited a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, provided that the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner. The FCC’s decision to abolish these rules is the subject of a review proceeding pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
 “Retransmission Consent” and “Must Carry” Rules. FCC regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, or the Cable Act, require each full-power television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals beginning October 1, 1993, to either: 

• | require carriage of its signal by cable systems in the station’s market, which is referred to as “must carry” rules; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiate the terms on which such broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market, which is referred to as “retransmission consent.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the three-year period commencing on January 1, 2021, we currently intend to maintain our “retransmission consent” elections with almost all of the MVPDs that carry our full-service television programming in our television markets. We have arrangements or have entered into agreements with nearly all of our MVPDs as to the terms of the carriage of our television stations and the compensation we will receive for granting such carriage rights, including through our national program supplier for Spanish-language programming, Univision, for our Univision- and UniMás-affiliated television stations, for the three-year period. We also have retransmission consent arrangements for our stations that do not have Univision or UniMás affiliations. As previously discussed, television stations in the same television market, even if not commonly-controlled, are not permitted to engage in joint negotiations for retransmission consent. This rule prohibits us and Univision from negotiating retransmission consent jointly, or from coordinating such negotiations, in those television markets where both companies own television stations.
 The FCC has rules that govern the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements based on a policy decision to have those agreements negotiated in good faith. The FCC is undertaking a proceeding that could result in establishing new ground rules for such negotiations, including prohibiting certain negotiating practices on the part of broadcasters. In recently enacted legislation, small groups of cable systems were permitted to negotiate with large broadcast stations groups. We do not believe that this provision will have a material impact on our retransmission consent revenues. We are not certain whether or in what other form such provisions might be adopted and the impact of such changes on our negotiations and the economic results of such negotiations. Under the FCC’s rules currently in effect, cable systems are only required to carry one signal from each local broadcast television station. As an element of the retransmission consent negotiations described above, we arranged that our broadcast signal be available to our MVPD viewers, no matter whether they obtain their cable service in analog or digital modes. Cable systems are rapidly transitioning to providing their services in digital only and we expect that remaining analog cable service operations will be terminated by most cable operators and in most markets in the near future. 
 We continue to explore and develop, subject to our legal rights to do so, and the economic opportunities available to us, the distribution of our programming in alternative modes, such as by delivery on the Internet through OTT services, by multicast delivery services, and to individuals possessing wireless mobile reception devices. 
 27


Time Brokerage, Joint Sales Agreements and Shared Services Agreements. We have, from time to time, entered into time brokerage, joint sales and shared services agreements, generally in connection with pending station acquisitions, under which we are given the right to broker time on stations owned by third parties, agree that other parties may broker time on our stations, we or other parties sell broadcast time on a station, or share operating services with another broadcast station in the same market, as the case may be. By using these agreements, we can provide programming and other services to a station proposed to be acquired before we receive all applicable FCC and other governmental approvals, or receive such programming and other services where a third party is better able to undertake programming and/or sales efforts for us. 
 FCC rules and policies generally permit time brokerage agreements if the station licensee retains ultimate responsibility for and control of the applicable station. We cannot be sure that we will be able to air all of our scheduled programming on a station with which we have time brokerage agreements or that we will receive the anticipated revenue from the sale of advertising for such programming. 
 Under a typical joint sales agreement, a station licensee obtains, for a fee, the right to sell substantially all of the commercial advertising on a separately owned and licensed station in the same market. It also involves the provision by the selling party of certain sales, accounting and services to the station whose advertising is being sold. Unlike a time brokerage agreement, the typical joint sales agreement does not involve operating the station’s program format. The FCC has eliminated rules that make television joint sales agreements attributable to the marketing station and, as previously discussed, this FCC decision is being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
 In a shared services agreement, one station provides services, generally of a non-programming nature, to another station in the same market. This enables the recipient of the services to save on overhead costs. 
 As part of its increased scrutiny of television and radio station acquisitions, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, has stated publicly that it believes that time brokerage agreements and joint sales agreements could violate the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSRA, if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSRA. Furthermore, the DOJ has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and has challenged them in certain locations. The DOJ also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to television and radio station acquisitions, above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny. See “Risk Factors” below. 
 Digital Television Services. The FCC has implemented digital television service in the United States. Implementation of digital television has improved the technical quality of television signals and provides broadcasters the flexibility to offer new services, including high-definition television and broadband data transmission. The digital transition for full-power television stations was completed in 2009. 
 The FCC has required full-power and Class A television stations in the United States to operate in digital television.  The transition date for low-power television stations to convert to digital or halt operations has been postponed until July 13, 2021. We have timely completed the digital transition of all of our full-power and Class A television stations to the digital mode. We are in the process of transitioning certain of our low-power stations to the digital mode, by the required transition date, where we believe is in our best interest to do so. 
 The FCC has adopted rules to permit low-power stations to operate on a paired or stand-alone basis in digital service. We have secured authority for certain of our low-power stations to have paired operations or operate in digital. In certain cases, we have requested authority to “flash cut” certain of our low-power stations to digital service. In those markets where no spectrum was available for paired operations, we will make a decision to switch individual stations from analog to digital service based on the viewing patterns of our viewers. We continue to review future use of certain of our low-power stations that continue to operate in analog and will determine whether to switch them to digital in advance of the July 13, 2021 deadline.
 Equipment and other costs associated with the transition to digital television, including the relocation of stations from one channel to another, have imposed some near-term financial costs on our television stations providing the services, some of which costs we recouped through reimbursements from the FCC. The potential exists for new sources of revenue to be derived from use of the digital spectrum, which we continue to explore as digital station operations evolve. 
 28


Digital Radio Services. The FCC has adopted standards for authorizing and implementing terrestrial digital audio broadcasting technology, known as “In-Band On-Channel™” or HD Radio, for radio stations. Digital audio broadcasting’s advantages over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services. This technology permits FM and AM stations to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats, or in digital only formats, using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use. We have elected and commenced the process of rolling out this technology on a gradual basis owing to the absence of receivers equipped to receive such signals and are considering its merits as well as its costs. It is unclear what effect such technology will have on our business or the operations of our radio stations. 
 Radio Frequency Radiation. The FCC has adopted rules limiting human exposure to levels of radio frequency radiation. These rules require applicants for renewal of broadcast licenses or modification of existing licenses to inform the FCC whether an applicant’s broadcast facility would expose people to excessive radio frequency radiation. We currently believe that all of our stations are in compliance with the FCC’s current rules regarding radio frequency radiation exposure. 
 Low-Power Radio Broadcast Service. The FCC has created a low-power FM radio service and has granted a limited number of construction permits for such stations. Pursuant to legislation adopted in 2011, this service is being expanded and the opportunities for FM translator stations reduced. The low-power FM service allows for the operation of low-power FM radio stations, with a maximum power level of 100 watts. The 100-watt stations reach an area with a radius of approximately three and one-half miles. The low-power FM stations are required to protect other existing FM stations, as currently required of full-powered FM stations. 
 The low-power FM service is exclusively non-commercial. To date, our stations have not suffered any technical interference from such low-power FM stations’ signals. Due to current technical restrictions and the non-commercial ownership requirement for low-power FM stations, we have not found that low-power FM service has caused any detrimental economic impact on our stations as well. Federal legislation has resulted in the increase in the availability of the low-power FM service and the FCC has recently begun granting new low-power FM authorizations.
 Other Proceedings. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, or SHVIA, allows satellite carriers to deliver broadcast programming to subscribers who are unable to obtain television network programming over the air from local television stations. Congress in 1999 enacted legislation to amend the SHVIA to facilitate the ability of satellite carriers to provide subscribers with programming from local television stations. Any satellite company that has chosen to provide local-into-local service must provide subscribers with all of the local broadcast television signals that are assigned to the market and where television licensees ask to be carried on the satellite system. We have taken advantage of this law to secure carriage of our full-power stations in those markets where the satellite operators have implemented local-into-local service. SHVIA expired in 2004 and Congress adopted the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, or SHVERA. SHVERA extended the ability of satellite operators to implement local-into-local service. SHVERA expired in late 2009, but was extended in May 2010 by the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act, or STELA. STELA provided a further five-year extension of the “carry one/carry all” rule earlier adopted in SHVIA and SHVERA and was further renewed in late 2014 under the terms of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, or STELAR. STELAR expired in 2019 and was replaced by the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019, or TVPA, which made the satellite carriage provisions permanent and required satellite television operators to serve all television markets. To the extent we have decided to secure our carriage on DBS through retransmission consent agreements, the statutory carriage provisions are no longer relevant to us. The FCC has been undertaking a lengthy proceeding dealing with the revitalization of the AM band and the results may affect the ability of certain of our AM radio stations to improve their signal carriage or may affect interference among stations. As of the present, we have not experienced any negative impact on the operations of our AM stations.
 Over the years, there have been legislative efforts in Congress to modify the tax laws to make advertising more expensive for businesses. Advertising is currently treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense. Should businesses not be able to deduct fully their advertising expenses in the year incurred, there could be a negative impact on advertising revenue for broadcasters. We cannot determine the effect of any such change in tax laws would have on our business and results of operations.
 White Spaces. The FCC has adopted rules allowing unlicensed users to operate within the broadcast spectrum in unoccupied parts known as the “white spaces.” The intention of the rules is to make available unused spectrum for use in connection with wireless functions related to connectivity between computers and related devices and the Internet. The FCC believes that the provisions it adopted will protect broadcast services. Broadcast groups, on the other hand, believe that operation of unlicensed devices in the “white spaces” has the potential for causing interference to broadcast reception. It is premature to judge the potential impact of what services, if any, operate under the FCC’s rules on over-the-air broadcasting. 
 Performance Tax. While radio broadcasters have long paid license fees to composers for the musical works they have written, radio broadcasters have never compensated musical artists for their recordings of these works. The rationale was that the radio broadcasting industry provided artists, free of charge, with a promotional service for their performance. 
 29


As the entire music industry has changed, with revenues from the sale of CDs continuing to drop dramatically, both musical artists and the recording companies have sought a change in how business is done. The recording companies, with the backing of many artists, have asked Congress to require that broadcasters pay fees for the broadcast exploitation of musical works. Such legislation received favorable committee action in Congress during 2009 and 2010, but no legislation was then enacted. Congress has not taken any subsequent actions, but the issue remains under consideration. Were such legislation to be adopted, its impact would depend on how any fees were structured. 
 Spectrum Policies/Incentive Auction. After studying national broadband needs, the FCC determined that more spectrum should be made available for wireless broadband services based on the growing usage of wireless devices by consumers and businesses and associated spectrum needs for telephony, data transmission, and entertainment purposes. In order to avert a spectrum crisis, the FCC proposed to recover and reallocate to wireless broadband a total of 500 MHz of spectrum, of which the FCC expected up to 120 MHz (amounting to 20 channels of 6MHz each) to come from spectrum currently allocated to over-the-air television broadcasting. 
 In order to achieve this spectrum reallocation, Congress enacted legislation and the FCC established a mechanism for broadcasters to participate in a “voluntary incentive auction” in which interested station owners would offer the spectrum usage rights of their stations in a “reverse auction”, providing spectrum usage rights for wireless operators to purchase in a simultaneous or future “forward auction”. Through a series of rulemaking proceedings, the FCC established how stations would be valued, what percentage of the auction payments would go to broadcasters, and what rights, if any, stations that relinquished spectrum usage rights or stations agreeing to share spectrum usage rights would retain following the completion of the auction process. The incentive auction process resulted in the FCC recovering from broadcasters 84 MHz, or the equivalent of 14 television channels of 6 MHz each.  Following the completion of the auction process in April 2017, the FCC provided for a repacking of the television band, commencing in late 2018 and extending until mid-2020, in order to deal with the reduction in spectrum available for over-the-air broadcast stations.  This repacking has had an impact on certain of our full-service and Class A stations which have been relocated.  The FCC has used certain of the proceeds derived from the auction to reimburse broadcasters for certain costs associated with such repacking and where our stations are affected by the repacking.  We have sought and received reimbursement from these funds to limit the economic impact of repacking on us. We have completed the repacking of all of our repacked full-service and Class A stations in compliance with the FCC’s schedule for undertaking the transition to post-auction channels.
 In the reverse auction process, we returned the spectrum for four of our full-service and Class A stations and we received proceeds of approximately $264 million in 2017.  Under the terms of the incentive auction, stations that returned their spectrum were entitled to engage subsequently in channel sharing arrangements.  Under a channel sharing arrangement, a station that has returned spectrum (known as a sharee) enters into an agreement, meeting certain requirements set by the FCC, with another station that has not returned spectrum (known as the sharer), and the two parties then divide the authorized spectrum of the sharer enabling both to continue to transmit programming but with smaller amounts of bandwidth.  A reduction in bandwidth may reduce the ability of a station in offering multicast programming and the revenue that can be derived from such service.  In the case of two of our stations that returned spectrum, they are engaged in channel sharing with other of our stations.  In the case of the other two stations, we entered into channel sharing agreements with third parties and expended certain of the incentive auction proceeds as consideration for the third parties to serve as our hosts. All of those channel sharing arrangements are now in full operation.
 The reduction in available spectrum arising from the post-auction repacking process may also have a detrimental impact on low-power stations (other than Class A stations), which are not protected owing to their secondary status.
 Regulation of Digital Advertising
 We are subject to many United States federal and state laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, applicable to businesses engaged in providing digital media advertising services. These laws potentially can affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices, increase our cost of compliance or impose a greater risk of liability. These laws and regulations continue to evolve and may substantially impact our ability to derive revenue from targeted digital and other advertising and marketing, and are likely to impose additional compliance costs on our operations.
 Compliance with privacy, data protection and data security laws plays a significant role in our business. In the United States, both federal and state laws regulate activities inherent to digital advertising, including the collection, use, sharing, and distribution of consumer data by us and by companies with which we do business in the course of providing digital media services. We also rely on the services of third parties in gathering, using and storing consumer data, and these parties’ compliance with applicable laws affects our own compliance status. Because we interact with consumers outside the United States and provide services to advertisers who themselves interact with those consumers, the laws of other jurisdictions may also apply to the types of services we provide and to the gathering, use, and sharing of the personal information of our viewers, listeners, and digital media users. Privacy and data protection regulations have gained substantial publicity and attention in light of growing consumer expectations both for enhanced services as well as privacy, especially in light of publicized data breach incidents and allegations of undisclosed and uncontested use of consumers’ personal information, and increasingly are the subject of regulatory attention and enforcement as well as private litigation often taking the form of consumer class actions. The regulatory standards continue to evolve in ways that impose additional 
 30


compliance costs and risks on businesses, like ours, that possess, process and share consumer data. Of particular importance is the enactment of the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, that became effective on January 1, 2020. While the California Attorney General delayed the date on which enforcement actions would be brought under the CCPA until July 1, 2020, the CCPA’s obligations are now in force. The CCPA imposes new restrictions on the use, sharing and security of personal information and substantially expands the definition of covered personal information to include geolocation information and device location data, among other categories of information. The CCPA also provides rights and remedies to individual consumers, including the right to object to certain marketing uses of their information and, in certain circumstances, the right to require deletion of their personal information and to opt out of the sale of their personal information. California voters, in November 2020, approved enactment of the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, that substantially amended the CCPA and broadened the rights provided to consumers covered by the CCPA.  In particular, the CPRA added a “Do Not Share My Data” right that empowers consumers to require that covered businesses cease “sharing” the consumer’s personal information for cross-context and cross-platform behavioral advertising.  This provision may directly impact our digital advertising revenue and impose substantial additional compliance costs. While the CCPA’s (and the CPRA’s) actual impact on advertising and marketing markets cannot yet be determined with any certainty, it is likely that advertisers, advertising service providers and data providers will modify their practices in ways that may inhibit direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising with potential revenue impacts. In addition, because of our targeted digital advertising strategies, we will be required to implement procedures to implement and recognize these rights and restrictions, imposing both operational costs and potential loss of revenues. The impact of the CCPA likely will extend beyond our California markets as it may be impractical to maintain parallel compliance processes across our markets. Other states are contemplating similar legislative and regulatory initiatives, some of which may impose additional or even inconsistent regulatory obligations. We are not presently able to determine the impact that the CCPA may have on our operations and results of operations.
 Because there is no federal privacy legislation broadly applicable across business sectors, broadcast and online advertising activities in the United States primarily have been subject to regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which principally relies on its enforcement authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, or the FTC Act, to investigate and respond to allegedly unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool at the federal level used to respond to claims of deceptive or inadequate advertising as well as privacy policies, inadequate data security practices and misuse of consumer data. The FTC’s enforcement focus has included close attention to the mobile advertising industry. For example, in December 2012, the FTC adopted amendments to rules under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which went into effect in July 2013. These amendments broaden the potential applicability of COPPA compliance obligations to our activities and those of our clients when interacting with children. In addition, the FTC’s testimonial and endorsement guidelines were updated in late 2009 and provide additional and expanded guidance for advertising practices using endorsements, testimonials, and similar content. In addition to formal rules and guidelines, the FTC’s active enforcement in the digital media industry creates evolving precedent for challenging digital advertising practices as deceptive or unfair.  State consumer protection laws and the enforcement of those laws by state attorneys general also impose substantial compliance risks on our business.  By way of further example, California’s parallel children’s privacy law also has been expanded and potentially reaches consumers not covered by COPPA. Because we rely upon third parties to assist us in operating and managing digital advertising and marketing strategies, our compliance obligations (and attendant risks) include the acts and omissions of those third parties.  Federal enforcement and state legislation is also increasingly applied to geolocation technologies and these developments may further impair data-driven digital advertising.
 The FTC has devoted particular attention to businesses within the digital media channel where the FTC has determined that potentially abusive practices have occurred or are likely to occur. The FTC focuses its enforcement resources on the accuracy of consumer disclosures, data security, data practices transparency, consumer tracking, and data aggregation. More recently, the FTC has communicated its intention to focus on the use of data to disadvantage vulnerable or minority communities, and particular attention has been paid to data brokers and aggregators of the type that may assist us in creating consumer profiles and in serving advertisements, with particular inquiry into issues of bias attendant to machine learning and algorithmically based practices. In some circumstances, the FTC has taken the position that advertisers may be liable for the acts of channel partners and has successfully brought enforcement actions against parties based on the activities of their channel partners. This creates the possibility of enforcement risk for acts other than our own.
 The FTC also has employed its Section 5 authority to take action against digital advertising businesses with regard to their data security practices and policies, even apart from its traditional enforcement of privacy regulations and standards.
 State attorneys general also enforce consumer protection laws, some modeled after the FTC Act, in ways that affect the digital advertising industry. In addition, several states mandate specific data security measures, and all U.S. states and the District of Columbia enforce data breach notification laws that require notification to consumers and, in some instances, law enforcement, in the event of a covered data security incident. There are private rights of action under some of these state laws, increasing the financial risk attendant to data incidents.
 31


In other markets we serve, the regulation of consumer practices in digital advertising is less mature. In Mexico, for example, the regulation of digital advertising largely relies on applying regulatory constraints on traditional print advertising (such as prohibitions on pornographic or politically inflammatory speech) to digital advertising. Brazil recently enacted a privacy law of general application based on the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, of the European Union, or EU, that may restrict the use of consumer data in connection with targeted and behavioral advertising.
 The issue of privacy in the digital media industry is still evolving. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, have considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, retain, augment, analyze, use and share consumer data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ “cookies” or other electronic tools to track online activities and by providing consumers with greater control over how their information is used, maintained, sold and shared. Enforcement bodies are developing rules and enforcement standards applicable to the collection, storage and use of geolocation data, biometric data, transparency of consumer data profile creation and management, and consumer access to and control over their individual online profiles and the collection of consumer data through “Internet of Things” technology. The privacy and data security laws of Brazil and Mexico, though still evolving, present a particular compliance obligation given our relationship with Brazilian and Mexican consumers. Mexican law mandates the application of adequate data security measures and the consent of individuals before processing their personal information.
 The EU and its member states traditionally regulated digital advertising practices pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC (commonly known as the “Data Protection Directive”) and implementing national legislation. Effective as of May 1, 2018, GDPR replaced the Data Protection Directive. The GDPR reaches a greater range of data processing practices that occur outside the EU than was the case under the Data Protection Directive, imposes substantially greater penalties for its violation, and imposes greater notice, consent, and data processing obligations than did the Data Protection Directive. Current and developing EU law, among other things, requires advertisers to obtain specific types of explicit notice to and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements, increases monetary penalties for non-compliance, extends the extraterritorial reach of EU data protection laws, and grants consumers the rights in some circumstances to require that their data no longer be stored or processed. It remains a possibility that additional legislation may be passed or regulations may be enacted in the future. The GDPR increases monetary penalties for its breach that can equal 4% of an enterprise’s gross global turnover. The United Kingdom has enacted children’s privacy legislation that will impose new and complex obligations on businesses whose advertising and data collection practices reach minors under the age of 18. The law’s requirements are substantially more extensive than under the United States’ COPPA framework. In addition, the withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the EU, and the current lack of a finalized permanent framework for data transfers between the EU and the United Kingdom following the withdrawal, including the absence of a means of maintaining long-term free flows of information between the EU and the United Kingdom, have created new uncertainty as to the scope and content of U.K. privacy laws. Additionally, other jurisdictions continue to develop enhanced data protection and security laws.
 The regulation of cross-border data transfers is in a state of heightened uncertainty, with an EU court having invalidated the Privacy Shield regime, which was developed by the EU and the United States to allow the transfer of the personal data of European nationals to certain jurisdictions, particularly the United States.  The EU and the United States have entered into negotiations aimed at creating a replacement for the Privacy Shield, but that potential solution may also be challenged on the same grounds as was the Privacy Shield.
 We also participate in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising and allow them to opt-out from the use of data we collect for the delivery of targeted advertising. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs in which we participate are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
 Additionally, in the United States and, increasingly, in other jurisdictions, consumers are provided private rights of action to file civil lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, against companies that conduct business in the digital media industry, including makers of devices that display digital media, providers of digital media, operating system providers, third party networks and providers of Internet-connected devices and related services. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits have alleged a range of violations of federal, state and common law, including computer trespass and violation of specific privacy laws. Recent appellate decisions have affirmed the standing of consumers to initiate class and mass action litigation to remedy breaches of their privacy rights and injuries resulting from data breaches. State attorneys general in most states have the authority to bring similar actions on behalf of their residents.
 Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or applicable international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection, or other policies, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, and also could result in reputational injury and/or monetary fines.
