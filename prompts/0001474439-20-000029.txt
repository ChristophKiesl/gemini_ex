ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Solution Overview
Telenav is a leading provider of automotive software and services providing both in-vehicle and cloud-based solutions. Over the past twenty years our focus has been on navigation and location-based services (LBS), where we pioneered many innovations including the market’s first mobile cloud-based navigation service. As a leader in hybrid navigation, Telenav counts among its customers three of the top five automotive OEMs by revenue and sales — Ford, GM and Toyota. Navigation and LBS are the primary applications for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems and we are using our strengths and core competencies to address the growing demand for overall connected car services.
In addition to navigation and LBS, our connected car platform, VIVID, enables us to deliver in-vehicle infotainment, or IVI, software solutions and services that are growing in importance as consumers increasingly include digital technologies as a factor in their automobile purchase decision. Automobile manufacturers, or OEMs, are also looking to software and connected services to build alternative and recurring revenue models beyond the sale of the vehicle. VIVID will provide OEMs a platform and a set of IVI applications to deliver an integrated and brand-specific, cloud-connected digital experience to their customers in a fast and cost-efficient manner.
Our VIVID Nav application delivers hybrid navigation, which can provide in-vehicle navigation that is cloud connected for real-time traffic and up-to-date destinations search, but which can also function when not cloud connected, such as when driving in areas with bad cell coverage.
In addition to navigation, VIVID will enable applications for in-car commerce that allow consumers to safely, conveniently and easily make purchases for common items, like fuel, parking and quick-serve food and beverage. Other applications include a media player that can work with the most widely used streaming services, an interface for common car controls, like the radio, HVAC, seat and other user settings, and functions enabling smartphone integration like communications and calendar access.
VIVID can also integrate voice-recognition-based smart assistants from leading commercial vendors to make the entire digital experience in the car hands-free and safe. OEMs will have the option of taking the VIVID infotainment applications and configuring the look and feel to make it brand specific or use the underlying VIVID SDK to build completely new IVI applications for a more-bespoke solution for their customers. 
We offer five variations of our VIVID Infotainment and navigation software products and services to our OEM and tier-one customers for distribution with their vehicles and systems. First, we offer on-board navigation systems that are built into vehicles with all key elements of the system residing in the vehicle as a self-contained application along with the related software and content. Our on-board navigation products do not require access to the Internet or wireless networks to function. However, they can utilize satellite or radio transmission to provide, for example, real-time traffic information. Second, we offer advanced navigation solutions that contain on-board functionality and also add cloud functionality, such as cloud search, cloud routing, map updates and “live” data. We refer to these solutions as hybrid navigation. Third, we offer mobile phone-based navigation solutions that project interactive map and navigation instructions to the vehicle's video screen and audio system, which we refer to as brought-in navigation. Fourth, we offer a VIVID Nav Software Development Kit, or SDK, that enables our customers to add mapping and location capabilities to their cloud, mobile and on-board automotive applications. Finally, we offer VIVID Infotainment, our connected car infotainment system that has navigation, commerce, voice, media, car controls and phone integration, which can be delivered as a turnkey solution or as an SDK. 
We provide our connected-car products and services directly to automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Company and affiliated entities, or Ford, which represented 44% of our revenue in fiscal 2020, General Motors Holdings and its affiliates, or GM, which represented 34% of our revenue in fiscal 2020, and Toyota Motor Corporation, or Toyota, which represented less than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2020. We also provide our products and services indirectly through tier ones, such as Xevo, Inc., or Xevo, for certain Toyota solutions; LG Electronics, Inc., or LG, for certain Opel solutions; and Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America, or Panasonic, for certain Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, or FCA, solutions. 
Our fiscal year ends June 30. In this Form 10-K, we refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and ending June 30, 2021 as fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Our total revenue was $191.2 million
in fiscal 2018, $196.7 million in fiscal 2019 and $240.4 million in fiscal 2020. Our net loss was $40.8 million in fiscal 2018, $32.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2020.
Business Strategy
We have built Telenav’s business and market strategy around the VIVID connected-car platform and solutions, addressing three automotive inter-related opportunities, as illustrated in the figure below.
In-car software and services
We have tailored Telenav's in-car software and services to help OEMs add a delightful digital experience to augment the actual driving experience and, thereby, build a “digital brand loyalty” with consumers. Our VIVID connected car platform and VIVID Infotainment provides a suite of integrated infotainment applications. With minimal customization, OEMs have the option of delivering VIVID Infotainment as their own branded offering, or they can use the underlying VIVID SDK to build their own. 
In addition to OEMs, tier-one suppliers of automotive solutions are also potential customers of VIVID. For example, Telenav recently signed an agreement with Alpine Electronics, a major tier-one supplier. The joint offering allows consumers with cars that support the MirrorLink technology to purchase a USB device with VIVID Infotainment loaded on it, and simply plug it into their vehicles to upgrade their vehicles with a modern and updated infotainment system. We are also exploring a direct-to-consumer offering of infotainment software and services to accelerate the adoption of our connected-car services. Our partnerships and joint-marketing initiatives extend to other tech players that are increasingly focused on the automotive industry, like Microsoft and Amazon, to leverage their technology and market access to increase traction for our connected-car solutions. 
VIVID Nav, Telenav’s hybrid navigation solution, is the primary navigation application in the Infotainment suite which OEMs can also adopt as a turnkey, standalone navigation application or use the underlying Nav SDK to build a purpose-built application for their infotainment system. VIVID Nav consists of embedded in-vehicle software along with a voice and graphical user interface to access maps and navigation features. The cloud component of VIVID Nav keeps the maps updated and gives users access to real-time and dynamic information including traffic, road alerts, search, POIs, in-car commerce and access to smart voice assistants. 
Navigation is the most complex and prominent application on an infotainment system and we believe Telenav’s long history and success in this space gives us a significant advantage for expanding our leadership beyond just navigation to the full suite of cloud-connected in-vehicle software and services. Our goal is to rapidly grow the base of connected car users for our OEM partners to help them deliver additional services and expand new sources of revenue. 
In-car commerce
One of the ways in which OEMs can monetize the digital channel established with connected infotainment is by giving users access to safe, convenient and delightful commerce on-the-go. VIVID Commerce, one of the applications in our VIVID Infotainment, allows users to seamlessly access a curated collection of in-car commerce products and services. The commerce 
offerings are centered around typical items that users purchase when they are out and about, such as fuel, parking, coffee, quick serve food items and groceries. 
The combination of navigation, location-aware search, smart voice assistance and merchant offerings tailored for in-car transactions paves the way for convenient, safe and frictionless shopping directly from the car. The opportunity for such seamless commerce is significant. A 2019 study by PYMNTS.com, an online media channel, estimated that consumers in the U.S. spent over $200 billion in 2018 just while commuting. The broader potential for such transactions in all driving instances expands considerably. We believe Telenav is well-positioned to enable OEMs to capitalize on that opportunity and jointly share in the transaction revenue. 
In the second quarter of our fiscal 2020, we achieved our first in-car commerce win with a Japanese OEM that we expect to launch later in fiscal 2021. For this initiative, we are enabling commerce functionality while driving, including purchasing of gasoline, parking and food with advance ordering and quick pick up from restaurants.
Besides building out the embedded application and back-end cloud infrastructure for managing the end-to-end flow of in-car commerce, Telenav has also made equity investments into companies to facilitate such transactions. SYNQ3 is one such company, which is focused on order processing and guest relationships for quick service restaurants.
A related part of providing commerce from the car is in-car advertisement. While user acceptance for in-app advertisement within the infotainment system is mixed, there is significant potential for “arrival ads”. Driving into a strip mall and pin-pointing the precise location of the vehicle as it pulls into a parking spot is an opportune time to provide a location-based ad that highlights special offers, discounts and deals provided by a nearby merchant. Here too, Telenav has made an equity investment in InMarket Media, LLC, a leader in location-based advertising. 
Not limited to such day-to-day transactions, in-car commerce also encompasses driving and vehicle related services, insurance being a prime example. The automotive insurance market is a $300 billion industry in the U.S. and, like many other sectors, it is undergoing many changes. The advent of connectivity, sensors and big data (AI/ML) opens up newer and more intelligent ways of offering coverage tailored to each driver’s unique driving behavior and patterns. Our investment in Motion Auto reflects our focus on this business opportunity, where such an investment complimented by our expertise in building in-vehicle software and cloud infrastructure puts Telenav in a position to capitalize on the disruptions in the auto insurance industry.
Road intelligence
The third part of Telenav's business strategy built around the VIVID connected car platform is the monetization of road intelligence. We define road intelligence as useful insights we and our OEM and commerce partners can gain through Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, including from the sensor data that can be captured with Telenav’s navigation and connected car software from the tens of millions of vehicles that are on the road, and millions more that we expect to add each quarter. 
We have used this intelligence in products like OpenTerra, which is an end-to-end mapping system that is built around crowd-sourced car sensor data and is based on the Open Street Maps (OSM) standard for map making. 
OpenTerra provides a low-cost alternative to expensive commercial mapping data, and can be used for a variety of applications, such as to collect data from its ride-hailing driver community to continuously expand and improve regional map systems. We sold certain intellectual property associated with our OpenTerra solution in 2019 to Grab, Southeast Asia’s leading ride hailing service. In exchange, we gained an equity position in Grab and retained the right to continue to offer OpenTerra technology in other Telenav ventures. We expect to see OpenTerra and its underlying technology be applied to such revenue opportunities in other regions and through similar mobility services. 
Beyond map making, we expect to see Road Intelligence based opportunities in other areas like road and traffic planning, smart city developments and as a data source for other automotive and mobility related use cases.
Automotive Navigation
Industry background
The automotive industry continues to go through a significant transformation due to the convergence of connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification, or CASE. In addition, due to high consumer expectations set by mobile phones, consumers are demanding user-friendly products that are well integrated, always up-to-date and easy to use. Our market research has shown that in-vehicle infotainment is one of the features that drivers value most when purchasing a new car. 
We believe, and market studies such as by Strategy Analytics, a leading automotive market research firm, indicate, navigation has been and will continue to be one of the highest in-demand consumer features within in-vehicle infotainment systems. Furthermore, with the CASE technology trends, navigation will continue to be increasingly important for OEMs to drive not just infotainment, but also other core features for driving safety and convenience in applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
In addition, navigation is an essential aspect of autonomous vehicles, as mapping and navigation are required to localize the vehicle and guide it to its destination. For shared mobility, finding the nearest vehicle to a rider and routing the vehicle requires mapping and navigation. For electric vehicles, range planning, optimization of energy use and finding charging stations along the route are enabled by mapping and navigation. In-car-commerce relies on location and navigation for delivering convenient commerce on-the-go. For these reasons, navigation is becoming increasingly important and a key element of future vehicle infotainment services and safety systems.
Industry challenges
The automotive industry is experiencing increasing pressures from new entrants, such as Tesla, and other players, such as software technology firms that have faster innovation and execution, which enable them to capitalize on current trends. As a result, traditional automobile manufacturers are striving to keep up with consumer demands for new and updated content on the infotainment system. Consumers desire to access connected apps through their vehicle’s controls and displays, and automobile manufacturers that enhance the in-vehicle experience with cloud connectivity and improved infotainment capabilities can find greater acceptance from consumers. However, delivery of these capabilities is technically challenging and not a traditional part of the automobile manufacturer's capabilities or supply chain. This challenge is driving automobile manufacturers to seek new partners to create differentiated in-car experiences. Automobile manufacturers are also under pressure because of the proliferation of brought-in platforms and products such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto along with other initiatives, including Google Automotive Services, or GAS, and Open Automotive Alliance, which take control of the products and platforms away from automobile manufacturers and tier ones and could diminish brand loyalty to the automobile manufacturer. To counter this, automobile manufacturers are investing heavily in their infotainment solutions and leveraging their ability to provide better integration of the various automobile systems resulting in easy-to-use hybrid navigation services that are seamlessly integrated with in-vehicle displays (center screen, cluster, heads up display, rear-seat), speakers, voice recognition and vehicle sensors. We believe this creates an opportunity for our product and services offerings.
Our competitive challenges and potential for differentiation
Automobile manufacturers procure various elements of each vehicle that they manufacture from third-party suppliers directly and through tier ones. We work directly with automobile manufacturers such as Ford, GM and Toyota, as well as through tier ones. Our strong track record as a provider of connected and personalized navigation services to mobile phones and our history of working with large wireless carriers has helped us develop skills and technology that are well suited to meet the demands faced by today's automobile manufacturers and tier ones. The sales cycle for automotive navigation systems is long, consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the automobile manufacturer and tier ones to succeed in securing business. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it define the ultimate product that it delivers to its end users in a way that not only enhances customer experience but also allows the automobile manufacturer to differentiate itself from the competition. Platforms and products such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto or GAS, along with the Open Automotive Alliance, are feature and content-rich and well-funded competitive offerings which are capturing greater attention and increasing share of the OEM market. However, we believe that our success with on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation solutions at Ford and GM, and the continuing shift in emphasis to connected services demonstrate the strength and differentiation of our offerings to other automobile manufacturers and tier ones. Through our ongoing collaboration with automobile manufacturers, we remain aligned with their goals and offer solutions that allow them to differentiate themselves from other competitors, providing their users with a superior experience and, as a result, creating brand loyalty among their customers.
Our automotive products and services
We entered the automotive navigation services business in fiscal 2008, initially with Ford, and our first on-board navigation product was launched in Ford's model year 2010 vehicles. Since that time, we have been working with Ford, GM Toyota and other automobile manufacturers and tier ones to deploy our various navigation products and services worldwide through on-board, brought-in and hybrid systems. 
Ford currently distributes our on-board product as a standard or optional feature in certain of its models and locations. Our navigation products are now included in Ford models principally manufactured and sold in North America, South America, Europe and China, as well as distributed in models sold in Australia and New Zealand.
Our partnership with GM began with our mobile navigation SDK in 2014. In 2017, GM launched its first model featuring integration of our hybrid navigation solution in North America, the 2017 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V. GM currently distributes our on-board, hybrid and brought-in solutions across a wide assortment of GM vehicles. Our hybrid navigation solution is available globally on select model GM vehicles and is expected to be available for model years 2021 to 2025.
We have a partnership with Toyota for brought-in navigation services where our Scout GPS Link mobile application is enabled to connect with select Toyota and Lexus models in the United States and Canada. In addition, we have an agreement with Xevo, Inc., a tier-one supplier to Toyota, whereby our Scout GPS Link and XevoTM Engine Link provide brought-in navigation services, including a fully interactive moving map, for select Toyota vehicles equipped with Entune 3.0 Audio, as well as select Lexus vehicles equipped with Lexus Enform. Our contract with Xevo relating to the implementation of our solutions in Toyota and Lexus vehicles is expected to remain in place through 2026.
While we saw expansion of our latest version of Scout GPS Link solution across more Toyota and Lexus models through fiscal 2019, we expect Toyota to limit or reduce the number of models or vehicles on which Scout GPS Link is offered by Toyota and Lexus, beginning in model year 2021, due in part to the offering of alternative brought-in solutions such as Apple’s CarPlay, which Toyota is offering across certain Toyota models, and the expanded offering of Google’s Android Auto solution across more automobile manufacturers.
We also provide entry level on-board navigation through LG, a tier-one supplier for the Opel and Vauxhall line of vehicles, for the European market. We expect our solution to be available in select vehicles for model years 2021 to 2022.
In August 2017, Daimler AG, or Mercedes, selected Telenav’s enhanced OpenStreetMap, or OSM, platform and navigation SDK to power its Mercedes-Benz COMAND TOUCH® Rear Seat Entertainment system throughout the world. In May 2019, we announced that our solution would provide fully interactive mapping for rear seat entertainment and would be launched as optional equipment on the current Mercedes E-class and S-class models.
We also have an agreement to offer our on-board navigation solution in select Jeep and Chrysler vehicles in the China market through Panasonic. Our on-board navigation solution was initially included in the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which had its China launch in August 2017, and is now included in other Jeep Cherokee and Compass models in China.
Going forward, we anticipate more automobile manufacturers and tier ones will offer our hybrid navigation solutions with up-to-date data such as traffic, fuel prices, maps and points of interest, or POIs, to deliver an enhanced user experience. In addition, as the market transitions to cars that are “always connected,” we expect our product and service offerings to become more personalized, safer and seamlessly integrated with other functions in the infotainment system, resulting in a better overall user experience. 
Platform and architecture
We design our automotive navigation product architecture with flexibility in mind such that we may deliver custom solutions efficiently, to meet the unique requirements of automobile manufacturers and tier ones. We have created and continue to enhance our reference navigation product, VIVID Nav, which serves as the foundation for our custom solutions and allows us to show automobile manufacturers our latest on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation capabilities. VIVID Nav is a turnkey cloud-connected navigation solution for automobile manufacturers that want to get to market quickly and cost effectively with little customization. For manufacturers that want to offer a more tailored experience, we offer the VIVID Nav SDK which allows them to create bespoke navigation applications in their IVI systems. VIVID Nav also comes with a companion app SDK for manufacturers to offer a mobile companion app. We have developed proprietary technologies to provide both hybrid (on-board) and smartphone-based, brought-in mapping and navigation services. Our hybrid navigation products include a broad set of services including local search for addresses and business, converting addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates known as geocoding, routing, map rendering, traffic decoding and processing, multi-level map matching, map updates, navigation and guidance. We have also developed customized technology to improve the quality of speech recognition for address and POI searches.
Our cloud location-based services platform includes our engines for routing, mapping, local search, voice recognition, geo data aggregation, traffic, personalization, and sensor processing. We leverage our existing back-end cloud technologies for deployment to automobile manufacturer and tier-one applications.
Our proprietary location-based services platform provides fast route and map generation while optimizing the route based on real-time traffic conditions. It also includes a local search technology so users can find addresses and POIs easily, to which users can then be routed. Because our proprietary platform uses computing resources efficiently, we are able to scale our servers economically for our automotive solutions.
Our back-end cloud services allow us to deliver up-to-date, location-based data and services to support our on-board navigation technologies. Our platform is designed to be content agnostic and offers the flexibility to use various data providers for maps, POIs, traffic and other content for location-based services. This enables the automobile manufacturer or tier ones to offer best-of-breed content, including by region, to delight their drivers. It also allows more competitive content pricing by offering the automobile manufacturer or tier ones the option of seeking bids from more than one content provider. We have expanded our navigation offering to add Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, capabilities. Our initial ADAS feature, called e-horizon, predicts the path of the user and extracts relevant map attributes to tell the vehicle about upcoming road characteristics such as curvature and elevation. The vehicle may then use this information to alert the driver of unsafe conditions, actuate the car and also improve fuel economy.
Our OpenTerra Platform includes a range of OSM capabilities that allow us to use crowd-sourced maps for more advanced navigation services. We first deployed OSM as part of our Toyota Entune Audio Plus and Lexus Display Audio multimedia products. We continue to develop the OpenTerra Platform and our OSM mapping technologies. We entered into an agreement with Grab Holdings, Inc., which, collectively with certain of its affiliates, we refer to as Grab, in August 2019 whereby we licensed to Grab certain intellectual property underlying our OpenTerra Platform. We also received a license back from Grab under certain intellectual property. We may explore similar agreements with third parties to monetize and further develop the OpenTerra platform. 
Infrastructure and operations
Automotive Navigation
Our end users rely on our services primarily while on the road. As a result, we strive to ensure the continuous availability of our services through our high-quality hosting platform and operational excellence.
Data center facilities. We developed our infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the availability of our applications, which are hosted by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, with facilities located in California, Oregon, Virginia, Germany, Ireland and South Korea. 
We entered into hosted service agreements with AWS for primary resource capacity and disaster recovery capacity. Pursuant to the service agreements, AWS provides leased facility space, power, cooling and Internet connectivity.
We have similar arrangements with Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s cloud computing business unit, Alibaba Cloud, to provide hosting services for our location services in China.
Research and development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our services and products. Our engineering team has deep expertise and experience in in-car embedded software, in-vehicle U.S. design, mobile software, location technologies and cloud services and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with location services applications and scaling hosted service models.
We currently focus our research and development efforts on: 

• | timely execution and delivery of contracted customer solutions;


• | enhancing our unified platform that enables more efficient deployment of our solutions across multiple customers and programs;


• | improving and expanding features, functionality and performance of our existing services;


• | creating new applications, services and functionality for vehicles and mobile phones;


• | developing key technology and content to reduce third party costs; and


• | building features and functionality that allow OSM to be enhanced.

Our development strategy is to identify features, services and products that are, or we expect to be, needed or desired by end users and provide our customers with a means to differentiate themselves against their competitors. 
As of June 30, 2020, our research and development team consisted of 596 people, 126 of whom were located in Santa Clara, California and 470 of whom were located in Cluj, Romania; Shanghai and Xi'an, China; Berlin, Germany; and Incheon, South Korea. Our U.S., China and Romanian research and development teams function together to provide service and product development for our automotive customers. Our research and development expenses were $79.9 million, $78.6 million and $79.3 million for fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Marketing and sales
Automotive Navigation
We employ a sales team that focuses on targeted customers and responds to requests from automobile manufacturers and tier ones for proposals and related sales opportunities.
The development and sales cycle for automotive navigation products and services is long. The automotive sales cycle is consultative and requires direct and continuous engagement with the customer to succeed in securing a design win. A typical sales cycle is 12 to 18 months long. Often the automobile manufacturer uses the sales process to help it to define the ultimate product that it chooses to deliver to its end users. Generally, design wins for vehicles are awarded 24 to 36 months prior to the anticipated model year launch of the vehicle, as it takes this much time to develop and integrate the software and cloud services. Once we launch services with an automobile manufacturer, our application and services are typically bundled with vehicles for multiple years.
Customers
We derive revenue primarily from automobile manufacturers and tier ones whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services. To a lesser extent, we have legacy relationships with wireless carrier customers to provide mobile navigation services to their subscribers through mobile phones.
We generate revenue from automobile manufacturers and tier ones for delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software for on-board and hybrid automotive navigation solutions. In addition, we earn royalties from brought-in navigation services for vehicle applications powered by our location-based services platform. We typically enter into long term supply arrangements with our automotive customers to provide our solutions across multiple car models in multiple regions around the world.
Our revenue from customers located in the United States comprised 89%, 80% and 73% of our total revenue for fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
We are substantially dependent on Ford and GM for our billings and revenue. In fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, Ford represented 76%, 62% and 44% of our revenue, respectively, and 74%, 54% and 44% of billings, respectively. In fiscal 2018, GM represented less than 10% of our revenue and billings, while in fiscal 2019 and 2020, GM represented 20% and 34% of our revenue, respectively, and 21% and 33% of billings, respectively. We expect Ford and GM to represent a significant portion of our revenue and billings for the foreseeable future. 
Ford
Our contract with Ford covers a broad range of navigation products and services, with primary focus on Ford’s North America and Europe production. Our agreement with Ford currently extends to December 31, 2033, which term may be earlier terminated or further extended at Ford’s option subject to certain conditions. 
We are the preferred provider during the agreement's term for on-board navigation integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms. We have also entered into amendments with Ford such that Ford Europe and Ford Australia and New Zealand also provide a map update program under which Ford owners with SYNC 2 until 2023, with respect to Australia and New Zealand only, or SYNC 3 in all geographies where we provide SYNC 3 products are eligible to receive annual map updates through the contractual period ending on December 31, 2033.
Our agreement with Ford relating to navigation solutions integrated with Ford's SYNC 2 and SYNC 3 platforms allows for renewals for successive 12-month periods if either party provides notice of renewal at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term, and the other party agrees to such renewal.
We have entered into a contract with Ford to develop navigation products and services integrated with Ford’s SYNC 4 platform for distribution to the North American markets for new vehicles through Ford's model year 2022. We anticipate
 production of SYNC 4 in Ford vehicles will begin in Fall 2020 and that service and warranty obligations under the contract will continue until December 31, 2029.
GM 
Our contract with GM includes the provision of our on-board, hybrid, and brought-in navigation solutions across a wide assortment of GM vehicles. Our mobile navigation SDK powers GM’s branded mobile and web-based applications and is covered under a services agreement that was entered into June 13, 2014 and extends to December 31, 2020. Our on-board and hybrid navigation solutions for GM are covered under a product and services agreement that became effective February 1, 2017, and which extends through December 31, 2026 and GM's model year 2025. In January 2020, the agreement was extended to provide services to subscribers until June 30, 2031. In April 2020, we also entered into a related agreement with GM wherein we agreed to provide certain service-based deliverables and further enhance the customized software for additional consideration, which we currently understand GM will use in certain of its model year 2021 and later vehicles.  As part of the agreement, we also resolved an open matter with GM relating to potential future adjustments by GM to its demand or purchase forecasts.
Our hybrid navigation solutions are available globally on select model GM vehicles, with primary markets including North America, Korea and South America, and in China with Shanghai-GM, or SGM. Our on-board navigation solutions are available on select model Opel vehicles through model year 2024. Under our agreements with GM, we are obligated to provide our navigation products and services for additional models and regions through model year 2025.
Intellectual property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available.
We seek to patent key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions. As of June 30, 2020, we held 181 U.S. patents expiring between April 11, 2020 and August 23, 2038, and we have 37 U.S. patent applications pending. These patents and patent applications may relate to features and functions of our services and the technology platforms we use to provide them. We have filed, and will continue to file, patent applications in the United States and other countries where there exists a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. 
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
We also enter into various types of licensing agreements to obtain access to technology or data that we utilize in connection with our navigation services. Our contracts with certain licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are payable regardless of the ultimate volume of revenue derived from the number of paying end users. Our most important agreements are with the providers of maps pursuant to which we generally pay a monthly fee per end user or copy or a per transaction fee. We obtain map data from HERE North America, LLC, or HERE, pursuant to a master data license agreement dated December 1, 2002. HERE is principally owned by a consortium consisting of Audi AG, or Audi, BMW AG, or BMW, and Mercedes. Our agreement with HERE automatically renews under its existing terms for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. In addition, we have entered into separate territory license agreements with HERE under which we are licensed to use certain map data for particular programs with certain of our current automotive customers to fulfill their requirements. The term of these territory licenses with HERE vary based on the customer and program, and can be extended for additional periods. Our agreement with HERE also allows a party to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations and fails to cure such breach. 
In addition, we obtain other data such as map, weather updates, gas prices, POI and traffic information from additional providers.
Competition and customer concentration
The markets for development, distribution and sale of location services are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases, more experience in the development of digital content and access to content partners, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do.
We compete in the navigation software market with established automobile manufacturers and tier ones and providers of on-board navigation services such as AISIN AW CO., Ltd, or AISIN, AutoNavi Software Co., Ltd., or AutoNavi, Robert Bosch GmbH, or Bosch, Elektrobit Corporation, or Elektrobit, Garmin Ltd., or Garmin, HERE, MapBox Inc., Navinfo Co., Ltd., or Navinfo, NNG LLC, or NNG, Shenyang MXNavi Co., Ltd., or MXNavi, and TomTom North America, Inc., or TomTom, as well as other competitors such as Apple and Google.
More broadly in the infotainment and connected car services market, our competition is increasingly weighted towards the tech giants, such as Google and Apple. Both have smartphone-based offerings - Google with Android Auto and Apple with CarPlay. These smartphone-based solutions are currently providing consumers with an alternative to embedded or built-in systems and services. However, brought-in solutions have disadvantages compared to built-in solutions, in that brought-in solutions are not seamlessly integrated into the vehicle. 
With a smartphone-based solution, applications like navigation, commerce, streaming media player, car controls and voice assistance are not as integrated with the vehicle’s native functions and physical interfaces. For example, simply connecting a smartphone to the vehicle system with wired or wireless options is often problematic and unreliable and can be frustrating to the end user. Beyond simply connecting to the applications from brought-in devices, other issues persist such as not having an adaptive, purpose-built design for individual vehicle makes and models with their unique array of car control features that have to be accommodated. In many instances, access in the near-term to vehicle sensor data, such as fuel or battery levels, seat occupancy and precise orientation of the vehicle, may not be available, limiting the user's personal experience and integration with the actual driving experience. 
Google currently provides an embedded offering called GAS, which has been increasingly focused on the automotive industry and expanding its presence with major OEM partners. For example, GM announced in September 2019 that it will begin offering vehicles with GAS beginning with GM’s model year 2022. Other OEM partners, such as Ford and others, may actively consider transitioning toward embedded and smart-phone offerings from Google and Apple with future model years, which would also align with end user expectations to extend to the car in-home and mobile infotainment and commerce platforms. However, with respect to the embedded GAS offering, we nonetheless see competitive advantages and opportunities to differentiate our offerings compared to GAS.

• | Telenav provides OEMs outright and shared ownership of all data;


• | Telenav’s solutions are cross-OS and support QNX, Linux and Android;


• | Telenav is voice assistant-agnostic;


• | Hardware requirements to support feature sets can impose significant cost burdens on OEMs and can limit implementation across an OEM's full product line; Telenav has been successful optimizing solutions for a wide range of hardware platforms, from luxury to low-end and mid-tier car markets (which make up the bulk of the volume of vehicles currently sold); and


• | OEMs may be concerned they risk being disintermediated from their customers and the monetization opportunity from end user services for OEMs could be severely limited when they allow Google to be the connected digital interface; Telenav works in concert with OEMs to enhance monetization and opportunities from end-user services and help expand potential revenue streams.

Competition in our markets is based primarily on pricing and performance, including features, functions, reliability, flexibility, scalability and interoperability; automobile manufacturer and tier-one relationships; technological expertise, capabilities and innovation; price of services and products and total cost of ownership; brand recognition; and size and financial stability of operations. We believe we currently compete favorably with respect to these factors based upon the performance, reliability and breadth of our services and products and our technical experience.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, including with respect to the following:

• | significantly greater revenue and financial resources;


• | ownership of mapping and other content allowing them to offer a more vertically integrated solution;


• | stronger brand and consumer recognition in a particular market segment, geographic region or worldwide;


• | the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;


• | access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;


• | access to custom or proprietary content;


• | quicker pace of innovation;


• | stronger automobile manufacturer or tier-one relationships;


• | more financial flexibility and experience to make acquisitions;


• | lower labor and development costs; and


• | broader global distribution and presence.

Our competitors’ and potential competitors’ advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our navigation services, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or even the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we substantially depend on GM and Ford for our current revenue, which in fiscal 2020 represented together approximately 78% of our total revenue. We expect this revenue concentration to continue for the near-term. GM announced in September 2019, that it will begin offering vehicles with GAS effective with model year 2022. If Ford were similarly to transition toward another third-party offering, such as an offering provided by GAS, Amazon, Apple or others, this would significantly impact our revenue in future years. For this reason, part of our strategy is to diversify and expand our OEM partnerships, including through strategic investments in both established as well as early stage connected vehicle technology companies. We believe this will enhance our ability to scale our core business faster as well as identify and incorporate innovative technologies and business models that we can then offer to OEM partners. We expect to continue to devote additional resources and attention to this strategy in fiscal 2021.
