ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
ITH is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in an advanced stage exploration project in Alaska referred to as the “Livengood Gold Project” or the “Project”. The Company is in the process of optimizing the Livengood Gold Project as discussed below. The Company has not yet begun preparation for the extraction of mineralization from the deposit or reached commercial production. The Company has a 100% interest in its Livengood Gold Project, which as of August 26, 2016 (the date of last measure), has a mineral resource of 497 million measured tonnes at an average grade of 0.68 g/tonne (10.84 million ounces), 28 million indicated tonnes at an average grade of 0.69 g/tonne (0.62 million ounces) and 53 million inferred tonnes at an average grade of 0.66 g/tonne (1.1 million ounces). In 2017, the Company issued the results of a pre-feasibility study that was summarized in the April 2017 Report which converted a portion of the mineral resources at the Project into proven reserves of 378 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.71 g/tonne (8.62 million ounces) and probable reserves of 14 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.72 g/tonne (353,000 ounces) based on a gold price of $1,250 per ounce. All work presently underway or planned by the Company is directed at preparing an updated pre-feasibility study to be released in a new NI 43-101 report for the Livengood Gold Project and maintaining necessary environmental baseline activities. A more complete description of the Livengood Gold Project and the current activities is set forth in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Since 2006, the Company has focused primarily on the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in Alaska and Nevada by acquiring through staking, purchase, lease or option (primarily from AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (“AngloGold”) in a transaction which closed on August 4, 2006) interests in a number of mineral properties in Alaska (Livengood Gold Project, Terra, LMS, BMP, Chisna, Coffee Dome, West Tanana, Gilles, West Pogo, Caribou, Blackshell and South Estelle) and Nevada (North Bullfrog and Painted Hills) that it believed had the potential to host large precious or base metal deposits. Since early 2008, the Company’s primary focus has been the exploration and advancement of the Livengood Gold Project and the majority of its resources have been directed to that end. In August 2010, ITH undertook a corporate spin-out arrangement transaction whereby all of its mineral property interests other than the Project were transferred to Corvus and Corvus was spun out as an independent and separate public company. Since the completion of that transaction, the sole mineral property held by the Company has been the Livengood Gold Project and the Company has focused exclusively on the ongoing exploration and potential development of the Livengood Gold Project.
 
The head office and principal executive address of ITH is located at 1177 West Hastings Street, Suite 2300, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2K3, and its registered and records office is located at 745 Thurlow Street, Suite 2400, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 0C5.
 
2020
 
Livengood Gold Project Developments
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made a decision to embark on a new phase for the Livengood Gold Project as a result of the favorable macro-economic backdrop for gold.
 
On May 8, 2020, the Company announced that the Board had approved a work plan to prepare an updated PFS on the Livengood Gold Project. The Company stated that it believed that the strength in the price of gold arising from the unprecedented accommodative fiscal and monetary stimulus from central banks and governments globally provided the necessary macroeconomic backdrop to support the advancement of the large, highly-levered, and long-life gold asset at Livengood.
 
On July 15, 2020, the Company announced that it had finalized the key contracts for completion of a PFS in respect of the Livengood Gold Project and expected to release the results of the PFS and the associated NI 43-101 Technical Report in October 2021. The comprehensive study will incorporate work that has been done since the last NI 43-101 report was completed to further de-risk and identify the optimal project configuration. The Company has engaged BBA, Inc. as its lead consultant and retained Whittle Consulting, Resource Modeling, Inc., Resource Development Associates, Easton Process Consulting and NewFields Companies, LLC to provide specialized technical support.

On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance (“ATM”) Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”), pursuant to which the Company was entitled, at its discretion and from time-to-time during the term of the sales agreement, to sell through B. Riley such number of common shares of the Company as would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of up to $10.3 million (the “ATM Offering”).
 
On September 2, 2020, the Company announced that its existing three largest shareholders had each taken their pro-rata share of the ATM Offering, resulting in the issuance of 5,670,997 common shares (representing 3% of the 187.6 million shares previously issued and outstanding) at the September 1, 2020 closing market price of $1.40 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.9 million.
 
On October 16, 2020, the Company announced that it had raised the full $10.3 million available pursuant to the ATM Offering with B. Riley. The Company issued a total of 7,334,513 common shares at an average price of $1.40 for gross proceeds of $10.3 million. The Company stated it intended to use the net proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the completion of the PFS announced in May 2020 to further de-risk the Livengood Gold Project and for environmental baseline studies.
 
Director Changes
 
The Company announced the appointment of Christopher Papagianis to the Company’s Board effective June 1, 2020. Mr. Papagianis was nominated for election as a director in accordance with an investor rights agreement with the Company’s largest shareholder, Paulson & Co. Inc. (“Paulson”), and fills a vacancy created by the June 1, 2020 resignation of Damola Adamolekun, the previous Paulson designee.
 
2021
 
Outlook
 
On January 12, 2021, the Company announced that the Board had approved a 2021 budget of $5.6 million and endorsed the associated 2021 work program to advance the Livengood Gold Project. The key element of the 2021 work program is the completion of the PFS on the Livengood Gold Project that is planned for release in October 2021. The work program will also advance the baseline environmental data collection in critical areas of hydrology and waste rock geochemical characterization needed to support future permitting, as well as advance community engagement.
 
The Company remains open to a strategic alliance to help support the future development of the Project while considering all other appropriate financing options. The size of the gold resource, the Project’s favorable location, and the Company’s proven team are some of the reasons the Company could potentially attract a strategic partner with a long-term development horizon who understands the Project is highly leveraged to gold prices.
 
Regulatory, Environmental and Social Matters
 
All of the Company’s currently proposed exploration is in the State of Alaska. In Alaska, low impact, initial stage surface exploration such as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling does not require any permits. The State of Alaska requires an APMA (Alaska Placer Mining Application) exploration permit for all substantial surface disturbances such as trenching, road building and drilling. These permits are reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment on and require specific changes to proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for significant disturbances generally requires 30 days for processing and all work must be bonded. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its currently planned exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of APMA permits, there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur.

ITH has established a Technical Committee, which has adopted a formal, written charter. As set out in its charter, the overall purpose of the Technical Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s continuing commitment to improving the environment and ensuring that activities are carried out and facilities are operated and maintained in a safe and environmentally sound manner that reflects the Company’s ideals and principles of sustainable development. The primary function of the Technical Committee is to monitor, review and provide oversight with respect to the technical aspects of the Company’s projects as well as monitor policies, standards, and programs relative to health, safety, community relations and environmental-related matters. The Technical Committee also advises the Board and makes recommendations for the Board’s consideration regarding health, safety, community relations and environmental-related issues.
 
Although not set out in a specific policy, the Company strives to be a positive influence in the local communities where its mineral projects are located, not only by contributing to the welfare of such communities through donations of money and supplies, as appropriate, but also through hiring local workers to assist in ongoing exploration programs when appropriate. The Company considers building and maintaining strong relationships with local communities to be fundamental to its ability to continue to operate in such regions and to assist in the eventual development (if any) of mining operations in such regions, and it attaches considerable importance to commencing and fostering such relationships from the beginning of its involvement in any particular area.
 
Corporate Structure
 
ITH was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) under the name “Ashnola Mining Company Ltd.” on May 26, 1978. ITH’s name was changed to “Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on June 1, 1988, and subsequently changed to “International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on March 15, 1991. ITH has been transitioned under, and is now governed by, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
 
ITH has three material subsidiaries:
 

· | Tower Hill Mines, Inc. (“TH Alaska”), a corporation incorporated in Alaska on June 27, 2006, which holds most of the Company’s Alaskan mineral properties and is 100% owned by ITH;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC, a limited liability company formed in Colorado on June 27, 2006, which carries on the Company’s administrative and personnel functions and is wholly owned by TH Alaska; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Livengood Placers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Nevada on June 11, 1998, which holds certain Alaskan properties and is 100% owned by TH Alaska.

Competition
 
ITH is an exploration stage company. The Company competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact the Company’s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
All aspects of the Company’s business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing and accounting. Since commencing its current operations in mid-2006, the Company has found and retained appropriate employees and consultants and believes it will continue to be able to do so in the future.
 
All of the raw materials the Company requires to carry on its business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing exploration activities at the Livengood Gold Project in mid-2006, the Company has been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct its contemplated programs. While it has experienced difficulty in procuring some equipment, such as drill equipment or services, experienced drillers and timely assay laboratory services in previous years, the recent overall slowdown in the mineral exploration business has resulted in more equipment and services being made available on a timely basis. As a result, the Company does not believe that it will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2020, the Company had three employees. The Company also uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering, community engagement and investor relations, and corporate governance.
Seasonality
 
As the Company’s mineral exploration activity takes place in Alaska, its business is seasonal. Due to the northern climate, exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November, although some locations afford opportunities for year-round exploration operations and others, such as road-accessible wetland areas, may only be explored while frozen in the winter.
