Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global ear, nose and throat (“ENT”) medical technology leader dedicated to transforming patient care. Our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved steroid releasing products are designed to provide mechanical spacing and deliver targeted therapy (mometasone furoate) to the site of disease. These products include our PROPEL® family of products (PROPEL®, PROPEL® Mini and PROPEL® Contour) and the SINUVA® (mometasone furoate) Sinus Implant. The PROPEL family of products are used in adult patients to reduce inflammation and maintain patency following sinus surgery, primarily in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (“ASC”), with increasing applications in the physician office setting of care in conjunction with balloon dilation and following post-surgical debridement. SINUVA is a physician administered drug, designed to be used in the physician office setting of care to treat adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery yet suffer from recurrent sinus obstruction due to polyps. In October 2020, we acquired Fiagon AG Medical Technologies (“Fiagon”), a global leader of electromagnetic surgical navigation solutions with an expansive portfolio of ENT product offerings, including the VENSURE sinus dilation platform (“VENSURE”) and the CUBE surgical navigation system and instrumentation (“CUBE”), that complement our PROPEL and SINUVA sinus implants across all settings of care and extend our geographic reach. The PROPEL family of products are combination products regulated as devices approved under a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) and SINUVA is a combination product regulated as a drug that was approved under a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The VENSURE products received 510(k) clearance in August 2020. CUBE and VENSURE are both regulated as medical devices.
Our Strategy
We are focused on becoming a comprehensive provider of ENT outcomes-based solutions and achieving consistent growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through:
•continuing to expand our portfolio of products based on our unique localized steroid releasing technology;
•utilizing our existing technology for further penetration among ENT physicians across sites of care; 
•generating clinical evidence to support unencumbered access and expanded use cases;
•continuing to expand internationally;
•investing in appropriate infrastructure to remediate, upgrade, and scale;
•managing working capital and cash burn; and
•establishing sustainable long-term growth. 
We are continuing to develop our sales force in order to expand communication of the benefits of our commercial products to physicians in the two different markets that PROPEL and SINUVA serve as well as the added benefits of VENSURE and CUBE navigation across the continuum of care. This is also being accomplished through building clinical evidence and the health economic case with third-party payors to establish reimbursement, as seen with the evolution from a single J-code for both PROPEL and SINUVA to separate codes as well as Pass-Through status during 2020 and early 2021. SINUVA in particular enjoys strong payor coverage and is covered for 75% of patients with private health insurance and 90% of patients with government-sponsored health insurance. We seek to grow our revenue by increasing the frequency of use of our products among current physician customers, by adding new physician users, increasing patient enrollment rates, and entering new markets.
CRS and Market Opportunity
Chronic rhinosinusitis (“CRS”) is an inflammatory condition in which the sinus lining becomes swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidity including difficulty breathing, chronic headaches, recurrent infections, bodily pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. These persistent symptoms can severely impact a patient’s well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and can lead to chronic fatigue and depression. The condition significantly reduces work productivity from 
absenteeism and reduced on-the-job effectiveness, which is especially meaningful given the average CRS patient age of approximately 37 years. The debilitating patient symptoms and quality of life impairments attributed to CRS create a significant healthcare burden to patients, insurers and employers.
We believe the significant unmet need across the continuum of CRS equates to a global market of approximately $20 billion with multiple technology segments in which to compete. Included in this is a significant demand in the U.S. market. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) approximately 12% of the U.S. adult population, or 29 million people, are affected by CRS, making it more prevalent than heart disease and asthma. We estimate that there are more than 2 million adults with CRS who are managed by ENT physicians in the United States every year, many of whom we believe could benefit from products that incorporate our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology. We estimate that the total addressable market of the PROPEL family of products was approximately $650 million in 2019, of which we had a 16% penetration. We further estimate that the total addressable market of SINUVA was approximately $300 million in 2019, of which we had a 2% penetration. The recent acquisition of Fiagon will allow us access to the estimated $250 million U.S. sinus balloon market and expand our European presence. While our primary commercial focus is the U.S. market, both PROPEL and PROPEL Mini received CE Markings, permitting them to be marketed in Europe. Our commercialization strategy considers several factors including regulatory requirements, reimbursement coverage for our products, and key opinion leader support. Our initial focus is on Germany and the United Kingdom, where we have begun to build our capabilities and develop a market, particularly with the increased adoption of PROPEL. In addition, we believe the use of SINUVA in the hospital setting, along with the increased adoption of PROPEL in the physician office setting of care, in conjunction with balloon dilation and following post-surgical debridement will contribute to early success in these markets. Going forward, we will continue to assess our capability to penetrate additional markets in the Asia Pacific and Japan.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated revenue of $80.6 million, $109.1 million and $108.5 million, respectively, and incurred a net loss of $72.3 million, $43.0 million and $22.9 million, for each respective year. Our revenues have been generated predominantly from the sale of our PROPEL family of products and SINUVA, and is almost entirely derived from within the United States. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $303.1 million. The net losses are a result of our election to invest in long term growth initiatives such as research and development, commercialization of our existing and future products, as well as enhancing our executive and management functions.

Current Treatments and Their Limitations
The treatment of CRS often entails a combination of medical management and surgical intervention to treat the underlying inflammation of the sinus lining, while addressing the secondary symptoms caused by obstruction of the natural drainage pathways. The first line of therapy for CRS is medical management, which typically includes prescribed antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids, and decongestants. Topical steroid sprays have poor efficacy due to their limited ability to reach the site of the disease, fast clearance of drug from the site of delivery, and poor patient compliance. Prolonged use of oral steroids may also lead to systematic complications which limit their use to short courses. 
In cases where patients’ symptoms continue to persist despite medical management, a physician may recommend functional endoscopic sinus surgery (“FESS”). In the FESS procedure, the physician enlarges the inflamed and obstructed sinus pathways by displacing and/or removing inflamed tissue and bone in order to facilitate normal sinus drainage and aeration. First 
introduced in the United States in the 1980s, FESS is considered the standard of care for surgical intervention to treat CRS. During most procedures, the honeycomb-like cells of the ethmoid sinuses are removed, resulting in one large open cavity. ENTs may also enlarge the frontal and other sinuses by either surgically removing tissue or dilating the ostia, or opening, with a balloon.
FESS is typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. During the procedure, a physician inserts an endoscope into the nasal cavity to provide visualization of the patient’s anatomy. Surgical instruments, powered cutting tools and balloon dilation devices are used to remove or dilate obstructive tissue and bone. Following the surgical intervention, physicians often pack the newly opened ethmoid sinuses with gauze or other obstructive sinus packing materials to hold the sinus cavities open. Although FESS can improve symptoms and quality of life, it does not correct the underlying cause of the inflammation and patients who undergo FESS procedures often experience significant pain and require continued post-operative therapy to maintain improvements. We believe that the limitations of medical management and lack of disease resolution after FESS lead to undertreatment of many CRS patients. We estimate that only a third of patients recommended for sinus surgery proceed with the potentially beneficial procedure, which we believe is due to its limitations and high risk for additional medical management and surgical revision.
Trend for treatment in the physician office setting of care
Multiple technological advances, including balloon sinus dilation devices, have expanded the treatable CRS patient population. Sinus dilation is now utilized by physicians in their offices to treat patients with mild CRS who may not be willing to undergo or are not candidates for sinus surgery performed under general anesthesia in the operating room setting. The ability to treat patients in the office with sinus dilation has spurred interest in the ENT physician community for additional products that facilitate treatment of patients in the office setting of care.
 While balloon dilation has been introduced to open frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, or dependent sinuses, in a less invasive manner, balloon dilation procedures are not designed to treat disease in the most commonly involved sinuses, the ethmoids, and this procedure does not address the underlying inflammation associated with CRS. We believe an opportunity exists to reach these undertreated patients by providing a more effective option to address inflammatory disease, while improving the overall outcomes of FESS. 
Our Product Offerings
The PROPEL Family
Our PROPEL family of steroid releasing implants are clinically proven to improve outcomes for CRS patients following sinus surgery. PROPEL implants mechanically prop open the sinuses and release mometasone furoate, an advanced corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties, directly into the sinus lining, and then dissolve over time. PROPEL’s safety and effectiveness is supported by Level 1a clinical evidence from multiple clinical trials, which demonstrates that PROPEL implants reduce inflammation and scarring after surgery, thereby reducing the need for postoperative oral steroids and repeat surgical interventions. The following is a description of the products in the PROPEL family. 
•PROPEL is a self-expanding implant designed to conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged sinus while gradually releasing an anti-inflammatory steroid over a period of approximately 30 days and is absorbed into the body over a period of approximately six weeks. PROPEL clinical outcomes have been reported in a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies to improve surgical outcomes, demonstrating a 35% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone. A physician may treat a patient with PROPEL by inserting it into the ethmoid sinuses.
•PROPEL Mini is a smaller version of PROPEL and is approved for use in both the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. PROPEL Mini is used preferentially by physicians compared with PROPEL when treating smaller anatomies or following less extensive procedures. PROPEL Mini has also been shown by our clinical studies to reduce the need for postoperative interventions, including a 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions in the frontal sinus, compared to surgery alone with standard postoperative care.
•PROPEL Contour is designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses in procedures performed in both the operating room and in the office setting of care. PROPEL Contour’s lower profile, hourglass shape and malleable delivery system are designed for use in the narrow and difficult to access sinus ostia. In PROPEL Contour’s pivotal clinical study, the product demonstrated a 65% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions in the frontal sinus ostia compared to surgery alone with standard postoperative care as well as a 63% reduction in occlusion and 73% reduction in the need for surgical interventions.
The graphic below illustrates the operation of the PROPEL family in the ethmoid sinuses:
We designed the steroid drug release of the PROPEL products to have a duration of approximately 30 days to match the postoperative healing cycle characterized in published medical literature. We selected mometasone furoate as the anti-inflammatory agent among numerous evaluated compounds based on three important characteristics: absorbability, binding affinity and low systemic bioavailability. The compound preferentially absorbs into the sinus lining instead of the surrounding mucous fluid. The drug has a high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity, making it highly potent in preventing inflammation once within tissue. Glucocorticoid receptors are the molecules in the surface membranes of cells throughout the body to which corticosteroids chemically bind. Additionally, the compound has low systemic bioavailability, meaning that it has negligible systemic safety side effects.
As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that approximately 3,200 accounts have stocked our PROPEL family of products for use by ENT physicians. Based on the number of units shipped as of December 31, 2020, we estimate that physicians have treated approximately 399,000 patients with our PROPEL family of products.
SINUVA
Following sinus surgery, the underlying chronic inflammation associated with CRS can lead to recurrent obstruction of the sinus cavity over time, especially in patients afflicted with polyps, a sign of severe inflammation. Improving care of such chronic patients holds meaningful opportunity to significantly reduce healthcare costs by reducing the need for revision surgery. We have designed the SINUVA steroid releasing implant to be placed in the physician office setting following a routine visit as an alternative treatment option for patients who are candidates for revision surgery. The implant is based on the same drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology as the PROPEL family of products but is designed to have greater radial strength in order to dilate an obstructed, polyp-filled sinus cavity, and deliver drug for an extended period of time. SINUVA was subject to regulation as a drug product and we received approval from the FDA to commercialize SINUVA in the United States under an NDA. We believe SINUVA could be an appealing alternative to patients who have previously undergone FESS but continue to suffer from polyp recurrence.
Our family of drug releasing implants consists of polymers that control local drug release and provide structural support to adjacent tissues during the healing process. We believe the development, manufacturing and regulatory approval for products incorporating this technology requires capabilities in polymer science, drug delivery, analytical testing and combination products. These competencies allow our technical team to tailor drug formulation, polymer design, drug release duration, implant radial strength, and degradation period to meet different clinical needs. We may apply these competencies to the development of new products over time. Such new products, or changes that we make in the therapeutic agent used in our products will require FDA approval prior to commercialization in the United States.
VENSURE
The VENSURE Navigable and Stand-alone balloon offerings are sterile, single-use devices designed to remodel the bony structures within the sinuses. The distal end of the device includes an atraumatic tip and can be shaped to fit the frontal, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses using the bending tool provided with the device. Since the distal end of the device is re-shapeable, one balloon can be modified to work on multiple sinuses within the same patient. Both versions of the product enable a physician to track the device into the sinuses using endoscopic visualization, while the VENSURE Navigable balloon allows for image-guided visualization when connected to the CUBE Navigation system. After confirmation of placement of both devices, the balloon can be inflated with saline solution, using the inflator to expand the outflow track of the targeted sinus. A suction tube may be connected directly to the fitting of the Stand-alone balloon device to provide active suction. We believe VENSURE provides for complementary use with PROPEL Contour for dilation and localized drug delivery as navigation becomes more prevalent.
CUBE Navigation
The CUBE Navigation System is an innovative virtual guidance platform for high precision ENT and ENT related skull-base surgeries. The system’s unique photo registration technology, VirtuEye™, enhances the user’s navigation experience and improves pre-surgery efficiency. This novel 3D-imaging technology mitigates common tactile tracing errors by collecting thousands of patient reference points in one camera shot. The entire photo registration process can be achieved in under 30 seconds without touching the patient. The sensor carrier containing localizer elements detects a signal within a low-energy magnetic field delivered from the navigation unit. The navigation software then displays the location of the sinus dilation instrument’s tip within multiple patient imaging planes and other anatomic renderings. CUBE can be integrated seamlessly into existing video towers and microscopes. We believe that CUBE navigation supports surgery and balloon dilation in all settings of care.
Our Technology Platform
Our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology consists of a polymer-based implant that is coated with a drug and polymer matrix. In fabricating the implant, we use polymers that are bioabsorbable and, over time, gradually and fully absorb into the body. The polymers chosen are materials with established safety profiles and have been used in medical devices for over 30 years.
 Our implants are designed to be self-expanding, which facilitates insertion when compressed, and expand to conform to the surrounding anatomy after insertion. The ability to control radial strength is important in enabling us to address different diseases at different states. For example, in some instances an implant may be used to maintain an already open passageway. In other situations, an implant with significantly greater strength may mechanically dilate a diseased passageway.
Our expertise in drug delivery allows us to effectively pair appropriate polymer delivery matrices with desired therapeutic agents. This allows selection of a therapeutic agent based on its clinical effectiveness and tailoring of the platform accordingly. In the case of PROPEL, we considered the wide range of off-patent corticosteroids, chose the one best suited for treatment of sinus inflammation, and customized the polymer coating to achieve the desired drug delivery. 
Clinical Trial Highlights
PROPEL and PROPEL Mini
PROPEL Ethmoid Sinus Studies. The safety and efficacy of PROPEL in the ethmoid sinuses has been studied in three prospective, multicenter clinical trials conducted in the United States enrolling a total of 205 patients. The principal safety and efficacy information is derived from the ADVANCE II randomized clinical trial and is supported by the ADVANCE clinical trial and an initial pilot study. A meta-analysis that pooled data from the ADVANCE II study and the initial pilot study provides further evidence of efficacy. In all three studies, implants were placed following ethmoid sinus surgery, or ethmoidectomy, which entails removal of the honeycomb-like partitions between the ethmoid sinuses in order to create larger sinus cavities.
Compared to the control implant, the drug releasing implant provided a 35% relative reduction in postoperative interventions, a 51% relative reduction in adhesion lysis and a 40% relative reduction in oral steroid intervention. The relative reduction in frank polyposis was 46%. Additional efficacy endpoints of significant, or severe, adhesions and middle turbinate lateralization, determined by clinical investigators at the study centers, were reduced by 70% (p=0.0013) and 75% (p=0.0225), respectively.
PROPEL Mini Frontal Sinus Study. We have completed a prospective, randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial to support an expanded indication for placement of PROPEL Mini in the frontal sinuses called PROGRESS. Approximately 30% of patients undergoing sinus surgery for CRS suffer from frontal sinus disease. We enrolled 80 patients in the study using an intra-patient control design to assess both safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed following surgery of the frontal sinus, compared to surgery alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in need for postoperative interventions such as the need for surgical intervention or oral steroids. In August 2015, we announced preliminary topline data from the PROGRESS trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed in the frontal sinuses following surgery, showing that the study met its primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrating a statistically significant 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone. In March 2016, we received approval to expand the indication of PROPEL Mini to treat patients undergoing frontal sinus surgery.
PROPEL Contour
In February 2017, we received FDA approval for PROPEL Contour, a steroid releasing implant designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses, which we believe represents opportunity for adoption in a variety of settings. In the operating room, PROPEL Contour has the potential to lead to expanded adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients’ disease and anatomy. We believe PROPEL Contour’s lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access. Since sinus surgeries typically involve treatment of one or more of the ethmoid, maxillary or frontal sinuses, we believe the PROPEL Contour greatly increases the chance that a PROPEL product will be used. We announced results of the second cohort of patients in the PROGRESS study in May 2016. This phase of the PROGRESS study was an 80-patient prospective randomized blinded multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Contour when placed in the frontal sinuses following sinus surgery. This study demonstrated a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the need for post-operative interventions, such as the need for additional surgical procedures or need for oral steroid prescription, compared to surgery alone with standard post-operative care.
SINUVA
In December 2017, we received FDA approval for SINUVA, a steroid releasing implant for the treatment of nasal polyposis in adult patients who have had ethmoid surgery. The SINUVA implant is intended to be placed in the physician office setting of care. This product’s primary mode of action is as a drug, and for this reason we were required to obtain an NDA approval from the FDA, rather than a PMA approval. In order to support the NDA application with the FDA, we completed four studies of SINUVA: a pilot study, a pharmacokinetic study, RESOLVE and RESOLVE II. In July 2016, we completed enrollment of the RESOLVE II pivotal trial, which was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded study of 300 patients. Both co-primary endpoints were met, including improvement in patient-reported nasal obstruction/congestion score (p=0.0074) and reduction in bilateral polyp grade as evaluated by a panel of three sinus surgeons (p=0.0073). In addition, several pre-specified secondary endpoints were met, including the reduction in the proportion of patients still indicated for repeat sinus surgery, reduction in ethmoid obstruction, and improvement in sense of smell. The RESOLVE study (n=100) included ocular exams, and patients were followed for six months to assess longer-term outcomes. Compared to the control group, the treatment group demonstrated greater reduction from baseline to day 90 in nasal congestion/obstruction score and bilateral polyp grade (judged by an independent panel), but these primary endpoint results did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1365 and 0.0985, respectively). According to clinical investigator grading, the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both bilateral polyp grade (p<0.02) and percent ethmoid sinus obstruction (p<0.0001) throughout the entire six-month study period. In a post-hoc analysis of nasal congestion/obstruction scores in a subset of 67 patients with at least grade 2 polyposis on each side at baseline, this outcome trended towards statistical significance in favor of the treatment group (p=0.0505). Longer-term, the study showed that at six months, control patients were at 3.6x higher risk of remaining indicated for revision surgery than treated patients. The findings from the RESOLVE study were used to inform the pivotal RESOLVE II study design.
In November 2017, we commenced the ENCORE study, a 50-patient multicenter, open-label study focused on evaluation of the safety of a repeat placement of SINUVA in a population of CRS patients with nasal polyps. Study findings showed no serious adverse events related to the implants during the measurement period and no serious adverse events related to a repeat placement during the interval studied. 
Research and Development
We continue to invest in research and development in order to expand our portfolio of products and improve our existing products. This will be achieved through a series of clinical studies on existing as well as pipeline products. We plan to initiate our EXPAND study in the second quarter of 2021, which will assess the VENSURE balloon and PROPEL Contour’s collective ability to improve healing and patency rates through localized drug delivery post-balloon dilation, as well as other outcomes. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at 30 days. In order to expand our global reach, we also plan to make clinical and regulatory investments in order to expand PROPEL in Europe. Our PROPEL OPEN registry trial is in place to fulfill EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) requirements and collect local data in order to support our commercial efforts. Other clinical trials initiated in the past include our investigational ASCEND drug-coated sinus balloon study initiated in December 2018. The ASCEND study was a prospective, randomized, blinded, multi-center trial of 70 patients that assessed the safety and efficacy of our ASCEND product. The ASCEND product was randomized against an uncoated balloon and, similar to clinical studies for our PROPEL family of products, the primary endpoint was evaluated at 30 days. This study assessed the ASCEND product’s ability to improve patency rates, as well as a number of other endoscopic parameters. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of frontal sinus patency grade at day 30, as judged by an independent reviewer. The secondary endpoints were analyzed for informative purposes. The ASCEND product showed significant differences in several important secondary endpoints favoring the treatment side including reduction in inflammation and polypoid edema at all timepoints through day 30, as assessed by both the clinical investigators and the independent reviewer. There was also a notable reduction in the need for oral steroid interventions at day 30, as determined by the independent reviewer. This study gives us valuable insight into the performance of our novel drug-coated balloon, enabling us to refine our clinical and regulatory pathway. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our efforts to enhance commercial execution and improve market access infrastructure were beginning to yield benefits as sales until the end of February 2020 were consistent with our expectations. However, sales declined towards the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter as the various COVID-19 restrictions were implemented and remained in effect. However, we began to see meaningful change in the business environment towards the end of May with increased procedure volumes as select areas of the country emerged from shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on elective medical procedures were eased. This trend continued in June and throughout the remainder of 2020 as we continued to see improvements in the elective procedure market. Our business has been and will continue to be impacted by patients’ decisions to undergo sinus surgeries as ENT ASC and office procedure volumes recover. Our operations may be further impacted by COVID-19 due to changes in our manufacturing operations as a result of the easing of certain restrictions of the shelter-in-place orders issued by local and federal authorities. We continue to remain flexible in our approach to 
continuing our operations in light of rapidly developing laws and restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. While the second half of 2020 provided an improving business environment, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to create severe disruptions and volatility in global capital markets and increase economic uncertainty and instability. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the various restrictions implemented, we have taken the following actions:
•Protect Health and Safety: Virtually all roles where physical presence for manufacturing operations is not required remain working from home, based on state and county guidelines, and non-essential business travel is limited.
•Maintain Customer Focus: All patient-support teams remain available to assist customers and patients, while strictly adhering to applicable restrictions, safety precautions and procedures.
•Reduce Costs: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took pre-emptive actions in the first quarter of 2020 to curtail spending and to reduce use of cash as revenues are and will continue to be materially impacted. We have also considered the incremental costs of business operations during the pandemic and expect these costs to remain until the current crisis subsides. The cost reduction actions included a) reducing our workforce by approximately 25% and furloughing an additional 5% of our workforce, b) substantially reducing new hiring, c) suspending near-term production, d) reducing discretionary operating expenses and capital expenditures, and e) delaying clinical research projects. As a result of these actions, we achieved significant cost reductions that, along with an improved operating environment as the pandemic restrictions eased, allowed us to meet our target liquidity levels at year end. We expect cost control measures to remain in place until the current crisis subsides. However, we will still continue to support our customers, physicians and patients.
Seasonality
We expect revenue from our PROPEL family of products, SINUVA, VENSURE, CUBE, and accessories to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal variations in the volume of sinus surgery procedures performed, which has been impacted historically by factors including the status of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and the seasonal nature of allergies, which can impact sinus-related symptoms.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of the companies developing or marketing ENT products are publicly traded companies, including Medtronic Inc., Olympus Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corp., Lyra Therapeutics, and Smith & Nephew Group PLC. These companies could develop drug releasing products that could compete with our products and most of these companies enjoy several competitive advantages, including:
•greater financial and human capital resources;
•significantly greater name recognition;
•established relationships with ENT physicians, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;
•additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and
•established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.
Because of the size of the market opportunity for the treatment of CRS, potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products or develop new products. New product developments that could compete with us more effectively are possible because of the prevalence of CRS and the extensive research efforts and technological progress that exist within the market. Large medical device companies with ENT divisions, such as Medtronic, also have capability in drug releasing stents. Companies may also market alternatives to current modes of treatment, such as OptiNose. Finally, there are established pharmaceutical companies evaluating monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of CRS, such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., who recently received FDA approval to market Dupixent for CRS with nasal polyposis.
Further, several more cost-effective alternatives exist to our products which include, but are not limited to: oral steroids, packing materials, spacers, and off-label practices not supported by clinical data. While we believe our products have significant advantages over sinus packing materials, spacers and other treatment options, they are expensive relative to packing materials and may not be fully reimbursed by third-party payors. As a result, ENT physicians may choose to use oral steroid delivery or packing/spacing materials or a combination of the two, which are less expensive, in lieu of our products.
We believe that our continued ability to compete favorably depends on:
•expanding our commercial operations to incorporate acquired products, customers, and new markets;
•continuing to innovate and maintain scientifically-advanced technology;
•having reimbursement in place to support broad adoption of our products;
•developing technologies for applications in the sinuses and other areas of ENT;
•attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
•obtaining patents or other intellectual property protection for our products; and
•conducting clinical studies and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 176 issued patents globally, of which 47 were issued U.S. patents, and we owned 73 pending patent applications globally, of which 17 were pending patent applications in the United states. Subject to payments of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued patents have expiration dates between 2021 and 2039, of which 38 will expire between 2021 and 2026, and the remaining 138 will expire after 2026. 
As of December 31, 2020, our trademark portfolio contained 88 trademark registrations, 13 of which were U.S. trademark registrations, as well as six pending trademark applications, all of which were U.S. trademark applications. 
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Manufacturing and Supply
We predominantly manufacture our steroid releasing implants at our facility in Menlo Park, California with components supplied by external suppliers. CUBE navigation equipment and instruments are manufactured in Hennigsdorf, Germany, and VENSURE sinus dilation balloons are procured from a third-party manufacturer. We perform inspections of these components before use in our manufacturing operations. Using these components, we assemble, inspect, test and package our implants, and send them to a third-party sterilization vendor. After sterilization, we perform inspections of the finished implants internally and via third-party laboratories to determine compliance with our specifications, after which we place the implants into our inventory and ultimately ship the finished products to customers. In addition, with the acquisition of Fiagon, we inherited the relationships with their existing distribution network which allows us to expand our global reach. 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and a number of our critical components used in our implants are supplied to us from single source suppliers. We rely on single source suppliers for some of our polymer materials, extrusions, molded components, and off-the-shelf components. Our ability to commercially supply our products and to develop our product candidates depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the API and polymer materials used in these products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. We have manufacturing, supply or service agreements with a number of our single source suppliers. Each of these suppliers manufactures the components they produce for us or tests our components and devices to our specifications. For example, in January 2020, we extended the agreement we had entered into in 2014 with Hovione Inter Ltd. (“Hovione”) pursuant to which we are required to purchase 80% of our API produced according to our specifications from Hovione, in quantities to be specified in 12-month forecasts provided by us and updated on a quarterly basis. This agreement is in effect until January 2025. In addition, we have agreements with companies that provide sterilization services and analytical testing for our products, as well as suppliers from which we purchase injection molded components to our specifications, our API and our customized packaging components. We typically seek to negotiate new agreements with these vendors in advance of the expiration of the current agreements. We intend to maintain sufficient supplies of the API and components from these single source suppliers in the event that our agreements with one or more of these suppliers were to terminate to enable us to continue to manufacture our implants for a sufficient amount of time necessary to obtain another source of API or components. To date, we have not experienced any significant supply constraints or delays in procuring components and materials, and while our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products or services on a timely basis in the past, they may be unable or unwilling to meet our needs in the future.
We continue to improve our manufacturing capabilities and increase capacity as we plan for enhanced commercialization of our portfolio of products. We are committed to continuous improvement and to maintaining compliance with applicable regulations. We have facilities that are FDA-registered medical device and facilities that are FDA-registered drug manufacturers. Additionally, our facilities are ISO certified, as applicable. We are required to maintain compliance with the 
regulations required for the countries we distribute our products. We are periodically audited by such agencies, including the FDA and European regulatory authorities (“Notified Bodies”) as applicable. During 2020, we extended the lease term of the Menlo Park facility to December 31, 2027. 
Government Regulation
United States Regulation of Medical Devices and Drugs
We are subject to numerous federal requirements. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant resources. Our products and any product candidates that contain both device and drug components are regulated as combination products by the FDA. The FDA’s Office of Combination Products designates a primary mode of action for such drug-device combination products, with the respective primary Center within the FDA leading the regulatory review for the product, in consultation with the secondary designated Center. The FDA determined that the primary mode of action for our PROPEL family of products was that of a medical device, so these products have been approved and are regulated as medical devices. By comparison, the primary mode of action of SINUVA was designated to be its drug properties, so this product has been FDA approved and is regulated as a drug.
FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device and drug product manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services, (“CDHS”) requires us to register as a medical device and drug manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and other regulatory bodies inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with current good manufacturing practices. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities, and product release for distribution. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular current good manufacturing practice inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facility.
Medical Devices
Our PROPEL family of products are regulated in the United States as Class III medical devices by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon controls the FDA considers necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, adherence to good manufacturing practices and maintenance of product complaint records but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. VENSURE devices are Class I but required 510(k) clearance. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls and also are subject to special controls such as performance standards, and FDA guidelines, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance as substantially equivalent to a predicate device under Section 510(k) of the FDCA approval. CUBE navigation systems are regulated as Class II medical devices. Class III devices are subject to the highest level of controls and rigorous clinical testing to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and generally require a PMA, or a PMA supplement approval prior to their sale.
Manufacturers must file an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application if human clinical studies of a device are required and if the investigational use of the device represents a potential for significant risk to the patient. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and engineering testing of the device. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA, human clinical studies may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a maximum number of patients, as approved by the FDA. The clinical studies must be conducted under the review of an independent institutional review board to ensure the protection of the patients’ rights.
Generally, upon completion of these human clinical studies, a manufacturer seeks approval of a Class III medical device from the FDA by submitting a PMA application. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including the results of the clinical studies, as well as testing and literature to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. PMA approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of certain post-approval studies, such as long-term follow-up studies.
Drugs
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, serialization, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product SINUVA and any future drug products we may develop and seek to commercialize, are subject to the FDA’s drug authority and are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
•preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”);
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
•the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA; and
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”).
Post-Approval Regulation
Following approval, the manufacturer remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other agencies, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as ‘‘off-label use’’) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the products, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, FDA or other international approvals may be required, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA or other agencies, may also place other conditions on drug approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to assure the safe use of the product.
FDA and other agency regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved PMA or NDA, etc., including product recall.
Other Healthcare Laws and Health Reform
Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including but not limited to federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security laws. Violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement is executed to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings. 
Additionally, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed reforms of the healthcare system in an effort to contain costs, improve quality, and expand access to care, including the proposed modification to some of the aforementioned laws. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of healthcare-related legislative initiatives that have significantly affected the healthcare industry. These reform initiatives may, among other things, result in modifications to the aforementioned laws and/or the implementation of new laws affecting the healthcare industry. Similarly, a significant trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products and procedures. Our ability to commercialize our products successfully depends in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement is available from third-party payors. As such, cost containment reform efforts may result in an adverse effect on our operations. 
For more information, see “Risk Factors.”
Foreign Regulation
In order for us to introduce our products in countries outside of the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject 
us to sanctions and fines. We believe we are in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations. 
Commercialization of medical products in Europe is regulated by the European Union (“EU”). The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the CE mark for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical product directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated countries that accept the CE mark. To obtain a CE mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality, and then according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. In order to maintain CE Markings, we must maintain compliance with ISO 13485. To maintain authorization to apply the CE mark, we are subject to annual surveillance audits and periodic re-certification audits. If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. 
In May 2017, the MDR was implemented to replace the MDD. The MDR will come into effect in May 2021 and imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical products and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. We may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of our existing market authorizations, or we may be required to modify existing products to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations. In addition, we may be required to reapply for CE marks under the MDR, in order to maintain our products in the EU Market after the expiration date of our current MDD CE marks. Failure to comply with the new regulations and obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner could prevent us from continuing to market our products in such countries. 
Market Access and Reimbursement
We continue to make meaningful advancements in our reimbursement strategy to improve access in all settings of care for both PROPEL and SINUVA, as well as incorporate existing reimbursement programs for CUBE navigation equipment and accessories and balloon dilation. However, uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we have or may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of our PROPEL family of products, SINUVA, and any of our other product candidates, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the products will be covered and the costs of the products will be adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for securing coverage for a product is separate from the process for establishing a reimbursement rate for the product if separately payable. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific patient subpopulations and may limit coverage based on product inclusion on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not ensure an adequate reimbursement rate.
Our PROPEL family of products are used primarily in the operating room of a hospital or ambulatory surgery center. These providers receive a facility fee for the sinus surgery procedure which is intended to pay for supplies used in this procedure, including the PROPEL family of products. SINUVA is a physician administered drug, used primarily in the physician office setting. However, payment is subject to payor coverage on the basis of either written medical policies related to the product or individual patient medical necessity. If, as a result of policies the payor has in place regarding these products, hospitals or other service providers are unable to receive adequate reimbursement to support the use of our products, this will negatively impact our revenues and our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. We applied to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for a product-specific J code for SINUVA, and in July 2019, CMS announced their final decision to establish a new J code described as “J7401 Mometasone furoate sinus implant, 10 micrograms.” This new J code became effective on October 1, 2019. CMS also made a final decision to eliminate the S1090 code, which was previously assigned to PROPEL, because they view it as duplicative to J7401. Subsequently, CMS approved SINUVA for transitional pass-through payment status for reimbursement under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”) and ASC Payment System. The new C code described as “C9122 Mometasone furoate, sinus implant, 10 micrograms”, took effect on July 1, 2020. Pass-Through status lasts for three years and allows us to place SINUVA in the ASC and hospital settings. Moreover, in January 2021, CMS approved a revised coding application for our PROPEL family of products and established a separate code for PROPEL, S1091 “Stent, non-coronary, temporary, with delivery system (propel)”. CMS also made updates to the current SINUVA J-code to J7402 “Mometasone furoate sinus implant, (sinuva), 10 micrograms.” The new PROPEL and SINUVA codes are scheduled to take effect April 1, 2021. Prior to October 1, 2019, reimbursement submissions to cover the cost of SINUVA were reported to payors using the unassigned Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code J3490.
