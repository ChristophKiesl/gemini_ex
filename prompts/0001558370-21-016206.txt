Item 1. Business
Overview
Haynes International, Inc. (“Haynes”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is one of the world’s largest producers of high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloys in flat product form such as sheet, coil and plate forms. The Company is focused on developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing technologically advanced, high-performance alloys, which are sold primarily in the aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company’s products consist of high-temperature resistant alloys, or HTA products, and corrosion-resistant alloys, or CRA products. HTA products are used by manufacturers of equipment that is subjected to extremely high temperatures, such as jet engines for the aerospace market, gas turbine engines used for power generation and industrial heating equipment. CRA products are used in applications that require resistance to very corrosive media found in chemical processing, power plant emissions control and hazardous waste treatment. Management believes Haynes is one of the principal producers of high-performance alloy products in sheet, coil and plate forms, and sales of these forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 60% of net product revenues in fiscal 2021. The Company also produces its products as seamless and welded tubulars, represented approximately 14% of net product revenues and in wire form, represented approximately 10% of net product revenues. The company also produces in slab, bar and billet form and sales of these forms, in the aggregate, represented approximately 16% of net product revenues.
The Company has significant manufacturing facilities in Kokomo, Indiana; Arcadia, Louisiana; and Mountain Home, North Carolina. The Kokomo facility specializes in flat products, the Arcadia facility specializes in tubular products, and the Mountain Home facility specializes in wire products. The Company’s products are sold primarily through its direct sales organization, which includes 11 service and/or sales centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. All of these centers are Company-operated. In fiscal 2021, approximately 78% of the Company’s net revenue was generated by its direct sales organization, and the remaining 22% was generated by a network of independent distributors, resellers and sales agents that supplement its direct sales efforts primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia, some of whom have been associated with the Company for over 30 years.

Business Strategy
The Company has undergone a significant positive transformation driven by a focus on price increases and cost reductions. One result of this transformation has been a 25% reduction in its volume breakeven point from roughly 5 million pounds shipped to below 4 million pounds with the current product mix; as proven this fiscal year with the Company’s profitable third quarter results at only 3.7 million pounds shipped. This lower breakeven point may be affected by product mix going forward but is expected to provide favorable incremental gross margin leverage with increasing volumes as anticipated in fiscal year 2022. 
The COVID-19 global pandemic had a significant impact on the Company’s financial results with substantial reductions in volumes and revenue in both fiscal years 2020 and 2021. During this period, the Company adjusted its strategy to pivot to a cost reduction and cash generation focus. This proved to be successful as the cash generated allowed for the implementation of a value-creating capital allocation strategy launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, further

described below. The cost reductions achieved that are related to process and yield improvements are expected to be not only sustainable but more fully realized as volumes improve. 
As volumes have begun to improve, the Company has returned to profitability, and the strategy has pivoted back to growing the business by increasing revenues, gross margin percentage and cash flow, while continuing to be the customers’ provider of choice for high-performance alloys and value-added processes. The Company has implemented a series of focus initiatives designed to unlock the potential of the Company by increasing volumes, improving pricing and relentlessly pursuing reduced costs, with the goal of expansion of the gross margin percentage. These goals are pursued within the overarching goal of safety, which continues to be the Company’s core priority. 
While maintaining this focus, the Company continues to evaluate new opportunities and applications for its products, particularly in its core markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbines, but also in the areas of renewable clean energy sources and other developing technologies relating to environmental and climate change issues. This includes new generation jet engines with better fuel efficiency and less emissions, as well as the use or consideration for use of HAYNES® alloys in advanced ultra-supercritical power plants, concentrated solar power, fuel cells, waste-to-energy and use of supercritical-CO2 power cycles for energy generation.  Innovation is a foundational strength of the Company with its exceptional technical expertise.
The following provides further discussion on certain focus initiatives that are core to this strategy.

● | Set prices to ensure the Company is compensated for the high-value differentiated products and services it provides. The Company favorably adjusted pricing year-over-year; which is expected to continue as additional agreements are renewed. These price increases are in addition to raw material price increases and contribute to improving margins. The Company is also focused on price increases to offset inflationary increases in the Company’s costs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimize processes to reduce costs. The Company is pursuing operational improvements, which include specific cost reduction projects. This ongoing pursuit includes initiatives in many different areas such as material management, productivity enhancements, yield and efficiency improvements and process optimization. These cost reductions are sustainable and expected to have a larger favorable impact with increasing volumes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase revenues by inventing new alloys, developing new applications and expanding into new markets. The Company believes it is an industry leader in inventing new alloys to meet its customers’ specialized and demanding requirements. The Company continues to work closely with customers and end users of its products to identify opportunities to develop and manufacture new high-performance alloys. The Company’s technical programs have yielded many new proprietary alloys with multiple applications, an accomplishment that the Company believes distinguishes it from its competitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developing new applications for its new and existing alloys is also a key strength and strategy of the Company. The Company leverages its technical expertise to develop unique applications for its products, especially proprietary and specialty alloys that can yield higher margins. These new applications, including use in unique special projects and new programs, are an important part of the Company’s growth and profitability strategy.
Through development of new alloys and new applications, the Company is seeking to participate in additional markets with new revenue streams beyond the core markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine. The Company believes that medical/pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, petrochemical and emerging technologies such as renewable and clean energy, hydrogen production and next-generation nuclear power generation all present possible significant growth opportunities for its products.

● | Increase revenues and provide additional product differentiation by providing value-added processing services and leveraging the Company’s global distribution network. The Company believes that its network of service and sales centers throughout the United States, Europe and Asia distinguishes it from its
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

competitors, many of whom operate only mills. The Company’s service and sales centers enable it to develop close customer relationships through direct interaction with customers and to respond to customer orders quickly, while also providing value-added cutting services such as laser, plasma and water-jet cutting. These services allow the Company’s customers to minimize their processing costs and outsource non-core activities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing market share by leveraging its unique business model. The Company is both a mill and a service center. This allows for mill flexibility and value-added services for the customer as described above. This business model focuses on superior customer service. The Company’s strategy leverages this differentiator to grow market share, as reflected by its recent market share growth in the industrial gas turbine market. In addition, the Company believes that the maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, business represents a recurring revenue stream that can be expanded post-pandemic. Products used in the Company’s end markets require periodic replacement due to the extreme environments in which they are used, which drives demand for recurring MRO work. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to expand the Company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The Company is committed to a culture of openness, trust and integrity in all aspects of its business. These high standards governing business conduct are for the good of the Company, its employees, its shareholders and its customers. The Company has a number of policies in place governing ethical conduct and believes that all people should be treated with respect in an inclusive and diverse environment. In addition, the Company has always been conscious of its environmental impact and is actively working to lighten its carbon footprint. This includes a notable solar power project at its North Carolina facility that is expected to provide over 50% of the electricity needed to power the facility upon completion of the project. Another important ESG consideration is the customers’ use of the Company’s products. The Company’s products are used as a part of the ever increasing demand for more efficient, cleaner and renewable energy that has led to the development of several emerging technologies requiring high-performance alloys for demanding operating conditions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on strategic equipment investment. The Company expects to continue to improve operations and gain traction in realizing a return on investment of capital in manufacturing facilities and equipment. Management believes that the Company’s capital investments will enable it to continue to satisfy long-term customer demand for value-added products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase profitability through strategic acquisitions and alliances. The Company intends to continue to examine opportunities that enable it to enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may include product line additions, market expansion opportunities or other cost synergies. The Company also plans to continue to evaluate strategic relationships in the industry in order to enhance its competitive position and relationships with customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementation of a value-creating capital allocation strategy. The Company implemented a share repurchase program in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 because management believes the market presents a unique opportunity to repurchase shares well below the intrinsic value of the Company. This belief arises from several factors, including the outlook of the Company’s end markets, particularly the anticipated recovery in commercial aerospace, combined with the Company’s gross margin expansion strategies. In the third quarter, the Company also established strategies to de-risk the U.S. pension plan and strive to decrease and eventually eliminate the associated liability, which was the largest liability on its balance sheet. The U.S. Pension net liability was $105 million at the beginning of the fiscal year and decreased to $26 million at the end of the fiscal year; a drop of $79 million. A glide path was adopted to help secure funding improvements realized this fiscal year including a customized liability driven investing (LDI) strategy designed to reduce interest rate risk and equity risk. The strategy also included an accelerated funding strategy with the intention of fully funding the plan in two to three years. This strategy included a lump-sum contribution of $15 million into the plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The funding percentage started the fiscal year at 68% and ended the year at 91%.

Products
The global specialty alloy market includes stainless steel, titanium alloys, general-purpose nickel alloys and high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloys. The Company believes that the high-performance alloy sector represents less than 10% of the total alloy market. The Company competes primarily in the high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloy sectors, which includes HTA products and CRA products. In each year of fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, HTA products accounted for approximately 80%, 81% and 75% of the Company’s net revenues, and sales of the Company’s CRA products accounted for approximately 20%, 19% and 25% of the Company’s net revenues. These percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the Company to its foreign subsidiaries, but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers. Management believes, however, that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section.
High-temperature Resistant Alloys. HTA products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines. Stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace-related market applications for HTA products. However, once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market, it tends to remain in use for extended periods. HTA products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels, electric power generation, power sources for offshore drilling platforms, gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power generators. 
Corrosion-resistant Alloys. CRA products are used in a variety of applications, such as chemical and petrochemical processing, power plant emissions control, hazardous waste treatment, sour gas production and pharmaceutical vessels. Historically, the chemical processing market has represented the largest end-user sector for CRA products. Due to maintenance, safety and environmental considerations, the Company believes this market continues to represent an area of potential long-term growth. In addition to the use of CRA products in the chemical and petrochemical processing industry, the Company has seen an increased demand for some of these alloys in applications such as gas-to-liquid and synthetic gas. For improved efficiency within relevant applications, higher operating temperatures and harsher environmental conditions are required and, as a consequence, high-temperature, corrosion-resistant alloys are used. Some of our HTA products offer excellent resistance to oxidation, sulfidation, metal dusting and other high-temperature degradation modes. The Company expects this area of the chemical and petrochemical industry to represent potential long-term growth opportunities for HTA products. Unlike aerospace applications within the HTA product market, the development of new market applications for CRA products generally does not require long lead times. 
Material Resources
Patents and Trademarks
The Company currently maintains a total of approximately 22 published U.S. patents and applications and approximately 295 foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products. Since fiscal 2003, the Company’s technical programs have yielded nine new proprietary alloys. The alloys being commercialized saw significant further advancement in the process during fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company will continue to actively promote its new alloys through customer engineering visits, technical presentations and papers.
In the aerospace, industrial gas turbine and high temperature markets, one of the alloys that has already seen significant commercial success is HAYNES® 282® alloy. This alloy has an excellent combination of high temperature strength, formability and fabricability. There have been a significant number of customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, and for other high temperature applications. The alloy has already been specified into major aerospace and industrial gas turbine applications, as well as for certain high temperature components in the automotive and industrial applications.  Another new alloy for use in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets is HAYNES® 244® alloy. It combines high strength to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit with a low coefficient of thermal expansion.  Commercialization is ongoing for this alloy, and it has been specified into certain aerospace engine programs and is being evaluated on others.

In the chemical processing industry, customers have found extensive applications for HASTELLOY® G-35® alloy, particularly in wet phosphoric acid production. Management expects demand for this alloy will continue to grow. Commercialization is also ongoing for HASTELLOY® HYBRID-BC1® alloy. HYBRID-BC1® alloy is a CRA product with applications in the chemical processing and petrochemical industries that has demonstrated resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid as well as several organic acids. 
In the oil and gas industry, HASTELLOY® C-22HS® alloy has found multiple applications. Commercialization of this alloy continues as is the testing, evaluation and promotion of this alloy with special emphasis on applications for this industry.
In addition to the successful commercialization of the above alloys, the Company continues to develop applications for four new alloys which are still being scaled up at the mill and are in the early stages of the commercialization process. HAYNES® NS-163® alloy is a nitride dispersion strengthened material that represents an entirely new metallurgical approach to achieving very high creep resistance at high temperatures. Technical process developments are still under investigation. HAYNES® HR-224® alloy is an HTA product with superior resistance to oxidation and excellent fabricability, and is being assessed in certain current and emerging technology applications. HAYNES® HR-235® alloy has excellent resistance to metal dusting in high temperature carbonaceous environments. Good progress in developing new applications for the alloy for petrochemical and syngas production applications has been made this past fiscal year. Most recently, HAYNES® 233TM alloy was introduced to provide excellent oxidation resistance coupled with superior creep strength at temperatures to 2100°F or higher. This combination of properties is believed not to have been achieved previously in a readily fabricable alloy. Significant progress has been made over the past year in developing applications for this new alloy. 
Patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the Company’s business. The Company’s strategy is to file patent applications in the U.S. and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the Company. In addition, the Company seeks to protect technology that is important to the development of the Company’s business. The Company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new processes, applications and alloys. The Company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers and employees. Trademarks on the names of many of the Company’s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.
While the Company believes its patents are important to its competitive position, significant barriers to entry may exist beyond the expiration of any patent period. These barriers to entry include the unique equipment required to produce these materials and the exacting processes required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties. These processing requirements include optimal melting and thermo-mechanical processing parameters for each alloy. Management believes that the current alloy development programs and these barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the Company.
Raw Materials
Raw materials represented an estimated 34% of cost of sales in fiscal 2021. Nickel, a major component of many of the Company’s products, accounted for approximately 45% of raw material costs, or approximately 15% of total cost of sales in fiscal 2021. Other raw materials include cobalt, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. Melt materials consist of virgin raw material, purchased scrap and internally produced scrap.
The average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the 30-day period ended on September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, as reported by the London Metals Exchange, was $8.02 $6.74 and $8.80 respectively. Prices for certain other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the Company’s products, such as cobalt, chromium and molybdenum were higher in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
The Company’s business model includes mill manufacturing and global distribution facilities, which create a long working capital cycle and contribute to a long position as it relates to commodity price risk, especially for product sold out of distribution facility inventory at spot prices.  In addition, the type of high-performance products the Company produces require multiple production steps to create the final yielded product that is sold to the customer.  These refining steps 

7



generate high revert scrap pounds that are recycled back through the melt at metal value.  This scrap cycle also contributes to a long position as it relates to commodity price risk.
Although alternative sources of supply are available, the Company currently purchases nickel through an exclusive arrangement with a single supplier to ensure consistent quality and supply. The Company purchases raw materials through various arrangements including fixed-term contracts and spot purchases, which involve a variety of pricing mechanisms. In cases where the Company prices its products at the time of order placement, the Company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials, thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials. However, to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly, there may be a favorable or unfavorable effect on the Company’s gross profit margins. The Company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers in connection with fixed price agreements with customers. In the event a customer fails to meet the expected volume levels or the consumption schedule deviates from the expected schedule, a rapid or prolonged decrease in the price of raw materials could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.
The Company values inventory utilizing the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) inventory costing methodology. Under the FIFO inventory costing method, the cost of materials included in cost of sales may be different from the current market price at the time of sale of finished product due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw material to the sale of the finished product. In a period of decreasing raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in higher costs of sales as compared to last-in, first out method. Conversely, in a period of rising raw material costs, the FIFO inventory valuation method normally results in lower costs of sales.
End Markets
The global specialty alloy market includes stainless steels, titanium alloys, general purpose nickel alloys and high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloys. Of this total market, the Company primarily competes in the high-performance nickel- and cobalt-based alloy sector, which demands diverse specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing. Given the technologically advanced nature of the products, strict requirements of the end users and higher-growth end markets, in general the Company believes the high-performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential, the opportunity for higher profit margins and greater opportunities for service, product and price differentiation as compared to the stainless steels and general-purpose nickel alloys markets. While stainless steel and general-purpose nickel alloys are generally sold in bulk through third-party distributors, the Company’s products are sold in smaller-sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct-to-customer basis.
The Company believes it is an industry leader in developing new alloys to meet its customers’ specialized and demanding requirements. The Company continues to work closely with customers and end users of its products to identify opportunities to develop and manufacture new high-performance alloys. The Company’s technical programs have yielded many new proprietary alloys with multiple applications, an accomplishment that the Company believes distinguishes it from its competitors.
Developing new applications for its new and existing alloys is also a key strength and strategy of the Company. The Company leverages its technical expertise to develop unique applications for its products, especially proprietary and specialty alloys that can yield higher margins. These new applications, including use in unique special projects and new programs, are an important part of the Company’s growth and profitability strategy.
Aerospace. The Company has manufactured HTA products for the aerospace market since the late 1930s and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market. Customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specification requirements, precise tolerances and achieving new product performance standards. Stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight, reduce emissions, and develop more fuel-efficient designs require close coordination between the Company, the aero-engine OEM’s, and its customers in the selection and development of HTA products. As a result, sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the Company’s direct sales force. Demand for the Company’s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft. The Company’s HTA products are used for static components in the hot sections of the aero-engine. The hot sections are 

8



subjected to substantial wear and tear and require periodic maintenance, repair and overhaul. The Company views the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business as an area of continuing long-term growth post-pandemic.
Chemical Processing. The chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse CRA and HTA applications driven by demand for key end-use markets such as automobiles, housing, health care, biopharmaceuticals, agriculture and metals production. Both CRA and HTA supplied by the Company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early 1930s. Demand for the Company’s products in this market is driven by the level of MRO and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities, as well as the construction of new facilities. The expansion of manufacturing of chemicals from natural gas in North America is expected to be a driver of demand in this market. In addition, the Company believes the extensive worldwide network of Company-owned service and sales centers, as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company’s direct sales efforts outside of the U.S., provide a competitive advantage in marketing its CRA and HTA products in the chemical processing market.
Industrial Gas Turbine. Demand for the Company’s products in the industrial gas turbine market is driven primarily by utility-scale electricity generation, both for base load as well as for backup generation during times of peak power demand. The benefit of these turbines are their relatively low cost, high efficiency, rapid response and reliability, especially as weather-controlled renewables have become major sources of electricity. An additional demand consideration is the drive to lower emissions from coal-fired generating facilities, since natural gas has gained acceptance as a cleaner, lower-cost alternative to coal. Industrial gas turbines are also used for power and propulsion in certain classes of ships and ferries, most commonly as derivatives of popular aero turbine engines. Demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation and for back-up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls. The Company also has a strong presence in micro turbine applications, which provide decentralized power and thermal heating for many key markets. The Company’s products have allowed turbines to operate with higher temperatures and efficiencies for much longer service intervals.
Other Markets. Other markets in which the Company sells its HTA products and CRA products include flue-gas desulfurization (FGD), oil and gas, waste incineration, industrial heat treating, automotive, thermocouples, sensors and instrumentation, biopharmaceuticals, solar and nuclear fuel. The FGD market has been driven by both legislated and self-imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities. This market has softened and is expected to continue to soften in the U.S. if the trend to switch from coal to natural gas for power plants continues, but has continued potential in other regions of the world. The Company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market, primarily in connection with sour gas production. In addition, incineration of municipal, biological, industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys. The Company continues to look for opportunities to introduce and expand the use of its alloys in emerging technologies such as solar, fuel cells, ultra-supercritical steam and supercritical-CO2 power plants, and nuclear fuel applications. Markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance, reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets, which could provide further applications for the Company’s products.
Through development of new alloys and new applications, the Company continues to seek to participate in additional markets with new revenue streams beyond the core markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbine industries. The Company believes that medical/pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, petrochemical and emerging technologies such as renewable and clean energy, hydrogen production, next-generation nuclear power generation and additive manufacturing all present possible significant growth opportunities for its products.
Sales and Marketing and Distribution
The Company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization, which operates from 14 total locations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, 11of which are service and/or sales centers. All of the Company’s service and/or sales centers are operated either directly by the Company or through its directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries. Approximately 78% of the Company’s net revenue in fiscal 2021 was generated by the Company’s direct sales organization. The remaining 22% of the Company’s fiscal 2021 net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the Company’s direct sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Going forward, the Company expects its direct sales force to generate approximately 75% of its total net revenues.

Providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the Company’s marketing strategy. The Company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers. These analyses enable the Company to evaluate the performance of its products enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers’ products. The Company’s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities. Management believes the Company’s combination of direct sales, technical marketing, engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high-performance alloy industry. This framework allows the Company to obtain direct insight into customers’ alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers’ demanding applications.
The Company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets, operating from service and sales centers in Asia and Europe (particularly the U.K.).
While the Company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales, the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to U.S. customers. The Company’s domestic expansion effort includes, but is not limited to, the continued expansion of ancillary product forms, the continued development of new high-performance alloys, the addition of equipment in U.S. service and sales centers to improve the Company’s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort, through the technical expertise of the Company, to find solutions to customer challenges.
The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the Company’s fiscal 2021 net revenues generated through each of the Company’s distribution channels.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
----------------------------------------------+---+-----------+---+-----------+---+-------+--
​ | | From | | From | | ​ | 
​ | ​ | Domestic | ​ | Foreign | ​ | ​ | 
​ | ​ | Locations | ​ | Locations | ​ | Total | 
Company mill direct/service and sales centers | | 52 | % | 26 | % | 78 | %
Independent distributors/sales agents | | 21 | % | 1 | % | 22 | %
Total | | 73 | % | 27 | % | 100 | %

​
The Company’s top twenty customers accounted for approximately 44%, 43% and 34% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. No customer or group of affiliated customers of the Company accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2020 or 2021.
Manufacturing Process
High performance alloys require an extensive knowledge of both the specific alloy systems, as well as the process parameters required to deliver a tightly controlled product to customer specifications. These products are tightly controlled from a chemistry standpoint, and require specialized equipment capable of delivering the physical and metallurgical properties that our customers require for their specialized applications. The number of process steps are typically more extensive for these high performance alloy systems as compared to what would be required for stainless or carbon steel products. This longer production cycle contributes to slower inventory turns. The Company manufactures its high-performance alloys in various forms, including sheet, coil, plate, billet/ingot, tubular, wire and other forms. The Company also performs value-added cutting services to supply certain customers with product cut to their specification.
At the Kokomo, Indiana facility, the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined, melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high-performance alloy. The Company’s primary melt facility utilizes two different melting processes. The ARC/AOD process utilizes electric melting and gas refinement to remove carbon and other undesirable elements, thereby allowing more tightly-controlled chemistries, which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high-performance alloys. The other primary melt method utilizes vacuum induction melting, which involves the melting of raw materials through electromagnetic induction while under vacuum conditions to produce the desired tightly-controlled chemistry. The control systems allow for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality. For most high-performance alloys, this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting. The resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an 

10



intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form. Intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling, annealing, pickling, leveling and shearing operations before being cut to final size.
The Company has a four-high Steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high-performance alloys, created specifically for that purpose. The four-high Steckel rolling mill was installed in 1982 and is one of the most powerful four-high Steckel rolling mills in the world. The mill is capable of generating over 12.0 million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to 72 inches wide. The mill includes integrated computer controls (with automatic gap control and programmed rolling schedules), two coiling Steckel furnaces and seven heating furnaces. Computer-controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the Company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers.
The Company also operates a three-high hot rolling mill and a two-high hot rolling mill, each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four-high Steckel rolling mill. These mills provide the Company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements. The Company believes the flexibility provided by the three-high and two-high mills provides the Company with an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders.
The coil and sheet operation includes the ability to cold roll to tight tolerances, bright anneal, oxidize anneal and pickle, along with finishing processes that slit and cut to size.  In recent years, the Company has invested and successfully brought on-line additional cold rolling capability, as well as annealing capacity to support the added rolling capacity. This added annealing capacity gives the Company the ability to offer either bright annealed finish or anneal and pickled finish that will be determined by specifications, application or type of alloy.
The Company also produces bar and billet product through a series of bar mills and a forge press operation that is located at the Kokomo, Indiana facility.  
The Arcadia, Louisiana facility uses feedstock produced at the Kokomo facility as well as outside suppliers to manufacture welded and seamless alloy pipe and tubing and purchases extruded tube hollows to produce seamless titanium tubing. The manufacturing processes at Arcadia require cold pilger mills, weld mills, draw benches, annealing furnaces, pickling facilities, and various finishing lines. The company has also invested in specialized ultrasonic testing, eddy current testing, including its own specimen testing laboratory. 
The Mountain Home, North Carolina facility manufactures high-performance alloy wire and small diameter bar products. Finished wire, bar, and powder products are also warehoused at this facility for quick delivery. The facility has recently made investments in various pieces of equipment to expand their portfolio to include bar products.
Backlog
The Company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices. At any given time, approximately 50% of the orders in the backlog include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs. Historically, approximately 70% of the Company’s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately 90% have shipped within 12 months. The backlog figures do not typically reflect that portion of the Company’s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or “just-in-time” basis. For additional discussion of backlog, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Research and Technical Support
The Company’s technology facilities are located at the Kokomo headquarters and consist of 19,000 square feet of offices and laboratories, as well as an additional 90,000 square feet of paved storage area. The Company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories, including a mechanical and wear test lab, a metallographic lab, an electron microscopy lab, a corrosion lab, a high-temperature lab and a welding lab. These facilities also contain a reduced scale, fully equipped melt shop and process lab. As of September 30, 2021, the technology, engineering and technological testing staff consisted of 26 persons, 13 of whom have engineering or science degrees, including 7 with doctoral degrees, with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering or materials science.
During fiscal 2021, research and development projects were focused on new alloy development, new product form development, supportive data generation and new alloy concept validation, relating to products for the aerospace, industrial gas turbine, chemical processing and oil and gas industries. In addition, significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, fuel cell systems, biotechnology (including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing) and power generation.
Competition
The high-performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten major producers participate in various product forms. The Company’s primary competitors in flat rolled products include Special Metals Corporation, a subsidiary of Precision Castparts Corp., Allegheny Technologies, Inc. and VDM Metals GmbH, a subsidiary of Acerinox, S.A.. The Company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high-performance alloys (similar to those the Company produces) and other competing metals. The Company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed, such as plastics, ceramics or additive manufacturing that may be substituted for the Company’s products. The Company also believes that it will face increased competition from non-U.S. entities in the next five to ten years, especially from competitors located in Eastern Europe and Asia. Additionally, in past years, the Company’s domestic business has been challenged by a strong U.S. dollar, which makes the goods of foreign competitors less expensive to import into the U.S and makes the Company’s products more expensive to export outside the U.S. 
In recent years, the Company experienced strong price competition from competitors. Increased competition requires the Company to price its products competitively, which pressures the Company’s gross profit margin and net income. The Company continues to respond to this competition through alloy and application development, increasing emphasis on service centers, offering value-added services, improving its cost structure and striving to improve delivery times and reliability.
With the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, pricing pressure has increased in many of the Company’s industries. The Company’s effectiveness in managing its cost structure and pricing for the value provided will likely be a key determinant of future profitability and competitiveness.
Human Capital Resources 
The Company values its workforce as one of its most important assets. Accordingly, the Company has adopted and maintains a number of programs and practices designed to attract and retain the best available personnel.

12



Succession and Recruitment
The Company has an organizational development and succession planning process in place for human capital strategic planning. The strategic development process is continually updated and often consists of multi-year succession and development plans for individuals. Such succession plans have been utilized throughout the Company to prepare employees for future roles and leadership opportunities. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other market forces that have altered, and are expected to continue to alter, the workforce and the manner in which it functions, the Company is redefining how many roles within the Company may be performed. For example, through experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has learned that many non-production employees are able to perform all or substantially all of their job functions outside of the office. In addition, virtual meetings have been used to substantially reduce travel as well as in-person contact. The Company is evaluating the effects of these and other changes on its current and future workforce, including their potential to provide the Company access to a broader recruiting pool for potential new employees, including workers in specialized areas such as metallurgy and others with specialties relating to the Company’s products, flexible role descriptions and/or working arrangements and other matters. 
The Company attempts to hire from within when opportunities occur, given employee growth and progression. The Company also utilizes outside recruiters due to the challenging and competitive hiring environment. In order to encourage development of a future workforce for the Company, the Company continues to sponsor a Ph.D candidate and Senior Metallurgical Engineers Research Project from Purdue University, as well as providing internships in various departments and locations throughout the Company.
COVID-19 – Pandemic
Economic conditions have limited hiring and succession planning implementation in some areas. In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company predominantly hired new personnel in order to backfill crucial positions. Hiring for succession planning or bench strength has subsided during the economic downturn in business related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. 
The onset of COVID-19 in the United States in fiscal 2020 and the ongoing economic downturn created additional risk related to key person retention and succession planning. In response to the economic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, previously implemented voluntary retirement incentives, reductions-in-force, and compensation reductions, created additional challenges to developing and retaining staff. This creates higher risk of turnover of key employees. In addition, other industries did not experience the same downturn as the Company did, and alternative opportunities are available for current employees and potential candidates.
Strong competition and limited workforce issues challenge the Company’s acquisition and retention of employees with specific skill sets. Limited dedicated resources and commitment for developmental positions may also impact the success and rate of succession and development efforts. Nonetheless, the Company has established formal and informal development activities to promote employee retention and position the Company for success in the long term. 
Retirement and Exit Programs
The Company has established a phased retirement program to sustain the Company’s access to institutional knowledge of employees with specialized skill sets who would like to phase into retirement. At the same time, the program is designed to facilitate a smooth transition for their successors. This program has been limited in its use but strategically beneficial. 
The Company also utilizes exit interviews and on-boarding interviews to provide feedback regarding turnover and employee desires for growth and development. Both have recently been strengthened and expanded. These interviews are also utilized to identify drivers of voluntary turnover and departures from the Company. Employee turnover rate and reasons, including voluntary and involuntary departures, are monitored annually. The global turnover rate in fiscal 2021 was 14%, compared to 22% in fiscal 2020 and an average of 14% in the previous two fiscal years. Both voluntary and 

13



involuntary terminations, including retirements, are used to calculate the turnover rate. The reduction-in-force resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic accounted for most of the increased turnover rate in fiscal 2020, however turnover was more normalized in fiscal 2021. 

Compensation Equity
The Company conducts inflation-adjusted compensation analysis to promote competitive compensation. This analysis takes into account ranges for the geographical area, education level and job title under consideration. The Company’s Human Resources Department develops offers for new salaried employees and also develops and administers promotions to maintain the internal integrity of the compensation levels for comparable positions. The Company works with managers to ensure that high potential employees and those individuals with unique talents are appropriately developed and compensated. For example, the Board of Directors authorized a pool of restricted stock that can be used to compensate high potential employees and for retention purposes. Further, bonus programs have been implemented at the LaPorte and Mountain Home facilities, as well as those in Europe and Asia, for retention and recognition purposes, and all salaried employees who are not eligible to participate in the Management Incentive Plan were given bonuses in fiscal 2021. The Compensation Committee, with the recommendation of the full Board in the case of incentive compensation, determines annual salaries and other elements of compensation of the Company’s executive management team, taking into account similarly situated executives employed by a peer group of companies while also considering input of the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant. 
Diversity and Inclusion
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board (the “Governance Committee”) considers diversity as a criteria evaluated as a part of the attributes and qualifications a Board candidate possesses. The Governance Committee construes the notion of diversity broadly, considering differences in viewpoint, professional experience, education, skills and other individual qualities, in addition to race, gender, age, ethnicity and cultural backgrounds as elements that contribute to a diverse Board. In keeping with this diversity commitment, the two most recent directors appointed to the Board, each of whom brings substantial experience in the form of executive leadership in the specialty metals industry and the U.S. Air Force, respectively, further the Board’s goal of enhancing diversity. 
Management also considers similar broad concepts of diversity in its hiring practices as well as its selection of vendors, contractors and other service providers. As a federal government subcontractor, the Company follows federal rules and regulations relating to diversity and other matters, including reporting requirements. 
Company Culture
The Company has controls in place relating to compliance with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including a requirement for annual employee certification of that code as well as an established whistleblower hotline and related procedures. In addition, human capital management, and more specifically employee hiring and retention, are included within the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management program, which is subject to Board oversight through regular reporting. 
Community Involvement
The Company has used internships and partnerships with universities to enrich recruiting efforts, particularly for technical roles such as research, alloy development and engineering. The Company has also utilized outreach and partnerships with local community resources at all major locations such as community and technical colleges, workforce development agencies, industry groups and other entities to strengthen the Company’s hiring process and expand the future workforce candidate pool.
Employee Engagement and Wellness
The Company has a long-standing tuition reimbursement program to assist employees with the continuation of their education. In addition, employee assistance programs offer counseling for emotional, financial and family issues. 

14



Continuing financial planning education is provided by the Company’s 401(k) plan administrator to assist employees in financial and retirement planning. For many years, the Company’s investment in human capital has involved commitments to worker training, apprenticeship programs and funding college scholarships.

Management and Board Oversight
Management is engaged in the Company’s efforts regarding management of human capital resources at all levels through regular informational meetings, the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management program and organized succession planning. The Board oversees these activities through regular reports by senior management regarding new or altered programs and as part of the Enterprise Risk Management process. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board is actively engaged in monitoring and encouraging diversity at the Board level while the Compensation Committee also focuses on achieving and maintaining internal and external pay equity for the executive team and the Board members while overseeing incentive compensation more broadly throughout the organization. In promoting external pay equity, the Board and the Compensation Committee make use of peer comparisons and benchmarking measures.
Employee Statistics
As of September 30, 2021, the Company employed 1,073 full-time employees and 37 part-time employees worldwide. All eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana and Arcadia, Louisiana plants (539 in the aggregate) are covered by two collective bargaining agreements. 
On July 1, 2018, the Company entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America Local 2958, which covers eligible hourly employees at the Kokomo, Indiana plant. This agreement will expire in June 2023.
On December 21, 2020, the Company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America Local 1505, which covers eligible hourly employees at the Company’s Arcadia, Louisiana plant. This agreement will expire in December 2025. 
Management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory.
Environmental Compliance
The Company has an enterprise level environmental policy, which focuses on fostering a safe workplace, offering high quality products while protecting the environment, compliance with law and health and safety management systems, utilization of all available resources to improve the quality, environmental, health and safety management systems and setting, implementing and reviewing quality, environmental, health and safety objectives and targets. This policy is communicated to contractors and vendors who provide services on site, and the Company periodically audits selected suppliers from an environmental compliance perspective. The Company maintains an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 standards and, for its Kokomo operations, ISO 50001 standards. The Company maintains multiple policies designed to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and has ISO 45001 certification. 
The Company’s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage, handling, use, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. In the U.S., such laws include, without limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, it is likely the Company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facility improvements. Expenses related to environmental compliance, which are primarily included in Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately $2.3 million for 

15



fiscal 2021 and are currently expected to be approximately $3.0 million for fiscal 2022. 
The Company’s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities, who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws, regulations and permits. In the past five years, the Company has paid administrative fines, none of which have had a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, for alleged violations relating to environmental matters, requirements relating to its Title V Air Permit and alleged violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal 2021, with additional expenditures of approximately $2.8 million for similar improvements planned for fiscal 2022.
The Company has received permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to close and provide post-closure environmental monitoring and care for certain areas of its Kokomo and Mountain Home, North Carolina facilities, respectively. 
The Company is required among other things to monitor groundwater and to continue post-closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site. As a result, the Company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater on the Company’s property. These levels are stable or decreasing, but additional testing and corrective action by the Company could be required. The Company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites, if required. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
The Company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off-site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. Generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, and state counterparts. CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators, site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties. The Company is currently named as a potentially responsible party at one site. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Legal Compliance
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, the Company must comply with a wide variety of other laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal and state securities laws, Delaware corporate law and safety laws and regulations. The Company continues to engage in collaboration with key stakeholders, such as customers and regulators, to adapt to changing regulatory expectations. Compliance with law and government regulations is not expected to have any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the Company. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
In addition to the information set forth below, further information regarding the Company’s environmental, social and governance activities can be found under the Sustainability tab on the Company’s website at www.haynesintl.com/company-information/sustainability.

It is critical that all employees, vendors and customers understand and accept that, in everything it does, the Company will conduct itself from the perspective of “doing the right thing for the right reason” at all times. 
The Company has a number of policies in place governing social and ethical issues, including, without limitation:

● | Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
--+------------------------------------


● | Anti-Harassment Policy
--+-----------------------


● | Human Rights Policy
--+--------------------


● | Human Trafficking Policy
--+-------------------------


● | Anti-Corruption Policy
--+-----------------------


● | Conflict Minerals Policy
--+-------------------------


● | Gift Policy

● | Supplier Code of Conduct
--+-------------------------

All Company employees must certify compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics annually, and regular training is provided to employees regarding these and other policies. In addition, the Company maintains a whistleblower hotline with access available on an anonymous basis online or by telephone. 
Environmental Matters
The Company is in the process of installing a 1MW solar fixed ground mount array system to reduce the dependence on nonrenewable energy sources at its wire facility located in Mountain Home, North Carolina. This solar system should provide over 50% of the electricity needs for the facility. In addition, since fiscal year 2010, the Company has invested more than $2.0 million in energy conservation programs, and as a result, the Company now saves approximately $1.1 million in energy costs per year. The Company has specific targets in place for reducing electricity and natural gas consumption in its energy conservation programs.
The Company has an enterprise level environmental policy, which focuses on fostering a safe workplace, while protecting the environment and complying with laws and health and safety management systems. The Company maintains an environmental management system certified to the ISO 14001:2015 standard, and Kokomo operations are ISO 50001:2018 certified. The Company’s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities. The Company utilizes available resources to improve quality, environmental and health and safety management systems, as well as set objectives and targets for each. This policy is communicated to contractors and vendors who provide services on site, and the Company periodically audits selected suppliers from an environmental compliance perspective. 
The Company is conscious of its environmental impact and is actively working to lighten its carbon footprint including projects to measure greenhouse gas emissions and develop goals of reduction. The ever-increasing demand for clean energy generation has led to the development of several emerging technologies that require high-temperature alloys for demanding operating conditions. 
 Since the invention of HASTELLOY® X alloy in 1954, the Company’s alloys have made it possible for aerospace engines to run at high temperatures for long periods of time. This has been further enhanced with alloys used in new generation engines such as HAYNES 282®. Engines being placed in service today reportedly consume 15% less fuel, 

17



produce 50% less pollutants and reduce the noise footprint near airports compared to the previous generation of airplane engines.  The environmental related improvements stem in part from the increased use of alloys, such as HASTELLOY® X, HAYNES® 188, 230®, 282®, 242®, 244® and other Haynes invented alloys.  
In addition to the Company’s alloys for energy production and powering modern aircraft in a more environmentally friendly manner, the Company’s alloys are used in chemical plants that produce ecologically safe agrichemicals which help to feed the world’s growing population. Company-invented HASTELLOY® G-35®, HYBRID-BC1® and C-276 alloys are commonly used in these applications. In addition, HASTELLOY® C-22®, C-2000® and B-3® alloys are used by the pharmaceutical companies for production of chemicals.
Renewable power generation offers the promise of producing power from nature’s resources, such as wind, sun, rivers and oceans, with minimal depletion to the Earth’s resources and damage to the environment. Many renewable energy technologies require the capture of energy at very high temperatures in extreme environments for which the Company’s alloys are well suited.  For example, the Company’s materials withstand intense heat in concentrated solar power plants to facilitate storable thermal power to generate electricity after the sun sets.
Safety Matters
Safety is the Company’s top priority. Listed below are certain improvement efforts the Company has implemented in order to reduce occurrences of injuries, occupational diseases and work-related fatalities. 

● | Each year, employees receive emergency preparedness training, and the Company conducts severe weather and fire drills periodically.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employees attend refresher training annually. This training includes coverage of the following items: Lock Out Tag Out, Confined Spaces, First Aid and Bloodborne Pathogens, Fire Prevention and Emergency Action Plan, Hearing Conservation, Hand Safety, Personal Protective Equipment requirements, Working Around Mobile Equipment and Walking and Working Surfaces.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All of the Company’s manufacturing sites have a volunteer Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT members are state-certified trained in first aid and HAZMAT response.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Company supervisors receive OSHA-10 Hour and Incident Investigation training.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company conducts routine departmental safety audits.
--+---------------------------------------------------------
