Item 1. Business.
 
The following historical business description should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our Corporate History and Current Business
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in May 2000. On March 13, 2014, following a series of mergers, acquisitions and business combinations, the Company changed its name from Beacon Enterprise Solutions Group, Inc. to FTE Networks, Inc.
 
Prior to October 2019, the Company was a provider of end-to-end design, construction management, build and support solutions for networks, data centers, residential, and commercial properties and services at Fortune 100/500 companies (our “Historical Business”). The Company’s primary activities included engineering, building, installation, maintenance and support solutions for state-of-the-art networks and commercial properties, including the following services: data-center infrastructure, fiber optics, wireless integration, network engineering, internet service provider, construction management and general contracting.
 
The Company had three operating subsidiaries (one of which is still an operating subsidiary):
 

(i) | Benchmark Builders, Inc. (“Benchmark”) was a leading full-service general construction management subsidiary that provided general contracting and construction management services on interior commercial spaces in the New York City market. As the primary operating subsidiary, Benchmark was divested in October 2019 as a result of a strict foreclosure by the Company’s senior creditors in exchange for the cancellation of the senior secured debt and other debt (the “Benchmark Foreclosure”), as discussed in detail in “Recent Developments – “Foreclosure by Senior Secured Lenders”. 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | CrossLayer, Inc. (“CrossLayer”), the managed network provider subsidiary, was designed to equip commercial real estate property owners and businesses with custom platforms that enabled them to introduce and deliver managed network service to their tenants. In an effort to reduce operating losses, and in connection with a reoriented corporate strategy stemming from the Company’s acquisition of a large rental home portfolio (discussed in “Recent Developments – “Acquisition of Vision Property Assets”), FTE divested itself of CrossLayer’s assets on January 16, 2020. 
(iii) | Jus-Com, Inc. (dba “FTE Network Services” or “Jus-Com”) is part of the Company’s core legacy business which focuses on telecommunications solutions in the wireline and wireless telecommunications industry. Jus-Com provided outside plant solutions (“OSP”), that included all forms and methods of connecting the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure, and inside plant operations (“ISP”) which consisted of cable rack, wiring build-outs, infrastructure build-outs and cable installation, among other things. Jus-Com’s OSP component was wound down in the first half of 2019; however, its ISP component remains an operating subsidiary. 

 
On December 30, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary US Home Rentals LLC, (“US Home Rental”) acquired a portfolio of approximately 3,200 rental home properties across the United States, and became a major owner, operator and investor of affordable rental housing in tier 3 and 4 markets.
 
The Company seeks to become a leading provider of affordable rental housing nationwide and with a focus on renovating its existing rental home portfolio and operating high quality single-family homes, which we expect will attract a strong resident base and yield long-term demand. The Company is continuing to evaluate real estate acquisitions with a view towards maximum portfolio optimization. The Company is headquartered in New York, New York.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
2019 Internal Investigation
 
During 2019, the Company launched an internal investigation into (among other things) the acts of certain members of former management who caused the issuance of approximately $22,700,000 in convertible notes and 5,186,306 shares of common stock to investors without the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), as well as whether the Company properly accounted for and disclosed: (i) certain related party transactions, (ii) expenses by and compensation to members of prior management, and (iii) interactions with the Company’s former audit firm. Information about the scope of this investigation, including the findings of the investigation and the Company’s remedial actions, are more fully described in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 11, 2020. As of the date of this filing, the Company is continuing to cooperate with the SEC, the New York County District Attorney’s Office (“NYCDA”), and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”) in their respective investigations into these matters.
Departure and Appointment of Executive Officers
 
Throughout 2019, the Company had a series of officer departures and interim appointments, including the resignation of its former Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), David Lethem, on March 11, 2019 and the termination of its former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Michael Palleschi, on May 13, 2019. There were several interim CEO appointments in 2019, culminating in the appointment of Michael P. Beys as interim CEO on December 11, 2019. Additionally, Ernest Scheidemann was appointed as the Company’s interim CFO on May 5, 2020. A complete list of the departures and interim officer appointments can be found in Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” of this Form 10-K.
 
On September 25, 2020, the Company entered into an executive employment agreement with Munish Bansal to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, US Home Rentals, effective September 28, 2020 (the “Employment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Bansal will transition to the role of Chief Executive Officer of the Company following the resumption of trading of the Company’s common stock on an over-the-counter market. Michael P. Beys will continue to serve as the Company’s interim Chief Executive Officer until such time. There is currently no trading market for the Company’s common stock and there can be no assurance that trading in the Company’s common stock will resume.
 
Departure and Appointment of Board Members
 
The composition of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) also underwent several changes in 2019. Luisa Ingargiola, Christopher Ferguson, Patrick O’Hare, and Brad Mitchell resigned on May 29, 2019. Fred Sacramone remained on the Board at that time and was joined by James E. Shiah, Jeanne Kingsley, Stephen Berini, Irving Rothman, and Richard Omanoff between April 2019 and June 2019. All of these Board members subsequently resigned in October 2019 and were replaced with the Company’s current Board, which, as of the date of this filing consists of Michael P. Beys, Joseph F. Cunningham, Jr., Richard de Silva, and Peter Ghishan.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
 
The Company issued two announcements on April 2, 2019 and June 11, 2019 in which it disclosed that the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”), following a communication with Marcum, LLP, its former registered independent public accounting firm, concluded that the Company’s previously issued audited financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and completed interim reviews for the periods ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 should no longer be relied upon.
 
The Company completed its restatement of the subject financial statements and filed its restatement as part of its annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC on May 11, 2020.

The Fourth Amendment provided for, among other things, $12,632,000 in delayed draw loans (the “Delayed Draw Term Loans”). The Delayed Draw Term Loans had a maturity date of March 31, 2019, and an interest rate of 12% payable quarterly in arrears according to the terms of the Credit Agreement and 4% of paid in kind interest. In addition, the Company and the Lenders agreed to enter into a restructuring services agreement. Lateral is controlled by Richard de Silva, who joined the Company’s Board of Directors on October 18, 2019.
 
The Fourth Amendment also provided for (i) amendments to the employment agreements between Benchmark, our former principal operating subsidiary, and Fred Sacramone and Brian McMahon, the principals of Benchmark who sold Benchmark to the Company in April of 2017 (the “Benchmark Sellers”); (ii) the issuance of a promissory note to Fred Sacramone for cash received in the principal amount of $1,000,000 (the “Sacramone Bridge Note”), which note originally matured on March 31, 2019, and was subsequently amended and restated on July 2, 2019 to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2020, and for which Mr. Sacramone was issued 356,513 shares of the Company’s common stock; (iii) the appointment of a finance transformation officer (who was acting in the capacity of Chief Financial Officer from January 23, 2019 through July 15, 2019); and (iv) the issuance of an aggregate of 1,698,580 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Lenders. During 2019, Mr. Sacramone served as Interim Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company.
 
Restructuring of Lateral Credit Agreement and Designation of Series H Preferred Stock
 
On July 2, 2019, the Company completed the debt restructuring contemplated under the Fourth Amendment by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) among the Company, Lateral and several Lenders. The Company also amended and restated the Series A convertible notes (as amended, the “Series A Notes”) and the Series B promissory notes (as amended, the “Series B Notes”) issued to the Benchmark Sellers, and the Sacramone Bridge Note (together with the Series A Notes and the Series B Notes, the “Benchmark Notes”).
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Summary
 
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Delayed Draw Term Loans, which were continued as super senior term loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $12,900,000 (the “Super Senior Term Loans”) were amended to: (i) extend the maturity to September 30, 2020; (ii) amend the interest rate to 12% per annum payable in cash; (iii) add a 4% extension fee to the principal amount (subject to reduction); and (iv) provide for monthly amortization payments based on available cash flow. In addition, the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement, with an aggregate balance of approximately $37,900,000 (“Lateral’s Existing Term Loans”) were amended to: (i) extend the maturity to April 30, 2021; (ii) amend the interest rate to 12% per annum payable in cash; (iii) add a 4% extension fee to the principal amount thereof (subject to reduction); and (iv) include monthly amortization payments based on available cash flow.
 
As consideration for the Amended and Restated Credit Amendment, the Company issued to the Lenders 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants (the “Warrants”) exercisable to purchase 3,173,731 shares of the Company’s common stock (collectively, the “Lender Securities”) with an initial exercise price of $3.00 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, in the event the Super Senior Term Loans were not paid and satisfied by October 31, 2019, the exercise per share of half of the Warrants would be automatically reset to $0.01 and in the event the Super Senior Term Loans were not paid by December 31, 2019, the exercise per share of the other half of the Warrants would be automatically reset to $0.01. The Company also agreed that on December 31, 2019, the aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants would be automatically adjusted on December 31, 2019 such that Lateral and its affiliates would beneficially own, in the aggregate, inclusive of all shares of the Company’s common stock previously issued, 25% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis as of December 31, 2019, subject to certain exceptions.
 
As additional consideration for the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and Lateral entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) whereby the Company agreed to register the Company’s common stock issued to Lateral. The Company and Lateral also entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) whereby the Company agreed that within sixty days of its execution, the Company would set the number of directors on its Board of Directors at seven and Lateral would be entitled to nominate one of such seven directors.

Series A Notes and Series B Notes and Designation of Series H Preferred Stock
 
In July 2019, the Series A Notes and Series B Notes were also amended to extend the maturity date to July 30, 2021 and to amend the interest rate to 8% per annum to be paid in kind until the borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were repaid in full. At the same time the Sacramone Bridge Note was amended to extend the maturity date to September 30, 2020, to capitalize the accrued interest as of July 2, 2019 and to provide for monthly cash interest payments. Additionally, all of the foregoing notes were amended to provide for monthly amortization payments based on available cash flow.
 
As consideration for amending and restating the Benchmark Notes, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) pursuant to which it issued to the Benchmark Sellers an aggregate of 1,951 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and 296 shares of the Company’s Series A-1 Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Series A Preferred”), which the Benchmark Sellers immediately exchanged, pursuant to exchange agreements (the “Exchange Agreements”), for an aggregate of 100 shares of a new series of preferred stock (the “Series H Preferred,” and together with the Series A Preferred, the “Preferred Stock”). The Series H Preferred had no dividend rights, no liquidation preference, was not convertible and had perpetual voting rights equivalent to 51% of the total number of votes that could be cast by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.
 
Foreclosure by Senior Secured Lenders
 
During July 2019, the Company was notified that judgments had been entered against the Company in favor of six holders of the Company’s convertible notes in the state of New York. Certain of these convertible noteholders sought to levy against the bank account of the Company’s former subsidiary, Benchmark, and filed an order directing the Company to turn over all of the Company’s assets. The Company’s failure to satisfy, vacate or stay these judgments constituted an event of default under the Credit Agreement.
 
As a result, on October 10, 2019, the Company consented to a Proposal for Surrender of Collateral and Strict Foreclosure (the “Foreclosure Proposal”), from Lateral, Lateral Builders LLC (“Lateral Builders”) and Benchmark Holdings, LLC (“Benchmark Holdings” and together with Lateral Recovery LLC (“Lateral Recovery”), the (“Foreclosing Lenders”)), pursuant to which the Foreclosing Lenders took possession and ownership of the Subject Collateral (see below) by means of a strict foreclosure by the Foreclosing Lenders (the “Benchmark Foreclosure”).
 
Pursuant to the Foreclosure Proposal, the Company transferred; (i) to Benchmark Holdings all of its (a) equity interests in Benchmark, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, and (b) cash on hand in excess of levels specified in the Foreclosure Proposal; and (ii) to Lateral Recovery, all of the Credit Parties’ interests in certain commercial tort litigation claims, fraud claims, and insurance claims as specified in the Foreclosure Proposal (collectively, the “Subject Collateral”).
 
Also pursuant to the Foreclosure Proposal, Benchmark transferred $3,000,000 of cash to the Company. Additionally, Benchmark agreed to make a monthly cash payment to the Company, in the amount of $300,000 per month (the “Working Capital Cash Payments”), for purposes of funding certain of the Company’s remaining obligations related to accounts payable, indebtedness for borrowed money, convertible note obligations and other matters specified in the Foreclosure Proposal (the “Remainder Obligations”). Working Capital Cash Payments were to continue until the earlier of (i) October 10, 2021, (ii) the repayment in full of the Remainder Obligations or (iii) the occurrence of a Working Capital Termination Event (as defined in the Foreclosure Proposal). The cash infusion and Working Capital Cash Payments provided the opportunity for the Company to receive total cash payments of up to $10,200,000 over the next 24 months. Benchmark made a total of two Working Capital Cash Payments to the Company—one in each of the months of November and December of 2019—for aggregate Working Capital Cash Payments of $600,000.
 
Benchmark Holdings, as the holder of the following of the Company’s obligations, absolutely and unconditionally released and forever discharged the Company and the other Credit Parties from certain indebtedness previously held by Niagara Nominee L.P. totaling $4,900,000, Lateral’s Existing Term Loans totaling $42,300,000 and the Super Senior Term Loans totaling $13,500,000 as each such term is defined in the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, Lateral’s Existing Term Loans and the Super Senior Term Loans were deemed fully paid and satisfied.

Additionally, pursuant to an Agreement Regarding Debt and Series H Preferred Stock (the “Debt and Series H Agreement”), entered into October 10, 2019, between the Company and Fred Sacramone and Brian McMahon, Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon released the Company and its affiliates from (i) all obligations represented by the Sacramone Bridge Note per the Credit Agreement, which had an outstanding amount equal to approximately $1,030,000 and (ii) indebtedness represented by the Series B Notes in the amount of $18,982,640. As a result, the total amount remaining outstanding under the Series A Notes and Series B Notes was $28,895,711 (the “Remaining Indebtedness”) with a due date of December 31, 2019.
 
The total debt relief provided pursuant to the Foreclosure Proposal and the related agreements and arrangements equaled an aggregate of $81,065,348.
 
In accordance with the Debt and Series H Agreement, the Remaining Indebtedness was to be automatically released and discharged as of December 31, 2019 unless (i) on or before November 10, 2019, the Company entered into a business combination transaction that enabled the Company’s common stock to remain listed on the NYSE American Exchange or any other U.S. national securities exchange and (ii) such business combination transaction was consummated on or before December 31, 2019 (such transaction, a “Qualified Business Combination”). Additionally, the Debt and Series H Agreement also required Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon to sell their shares of Series H Preferred Stock to the Company for a nominal price in the event an agreement for a Qualified Business Combination was entered into on or before November 10, 2019, and such Qualified Business Combination was consummated on or before December 31, 2019.
 
On November 8, 2019, the Company and Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon entered into an amendment to the Debt and Series H Agreement, extending the date by which an agreement for a Qualified Business Combination must be entered into from November 10, 2019 to December 31, 2019 and extending the date by which a Qualified Business Combination must close from December 31, 2019 to February 28, 2020.
 
On December 23, 2019, the Company entered into separate agreements with Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon pursuant to which the Company repurchased all outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Stock from Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon for a payment of $1.00 per share, as a result of which no shares of Series H Preferred Stock remain outstanding.
 
In January 2020, in order to facilitate the continued inflow of additional cash infusions from Benchmark pertaining to the Remaining Indebtedness (as further explained below), the Board determined that, as result of the completion of the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase, Benchmark would no longer be obligated to continue making Working Capital Cash Payments to the Company. On January 10, 2020, Benchmark loaned $300,000 to the Company with a maturity date of October 1, 2020 and an annual interest rate of 10%. Shortly thereafter, on January 27, 2020, the Company issued two senior promissory notes to Benchmark, one in the principal amount of $4,129,000 and the other in the principal amount of $600,000 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”), each such note is secured by all of the Company’s non-real estate assets. The $4,129,000 note was issued in consideration of an additional $6,000,000 reduction to the $28,895,711 Remaining Indebtedness, provided for a maturity date of December 1, 2020, bore interest at an annual rate of 10% and obligated the Company to repay all monies previously paid or transferred to the Company pursuant to the Foreclosure Proposal, including (i) $3,000,000 in cash; (ii) two Working Capital Cash Payments totaling $600,000; and (iii) approximately $529,000 in cash remaining in a Benchmark bank account. The $600,000 note, which matures on December 1, 2020 and has an interest rate of 10%, was issued to evidence the loan received by Benchmark on January 10, 2020 in the principal amount of $300,000 and an additional $300,000 loan from Benchmark received on January 27, 2020. In summary, the Company issued promissory notes to Benchmark totaling $4,729,000 and released Benchmark from the obligation to make an additional $6,600,000 in Working Capital Cash Payments in exchange for a $6,000,000 reduction in the Remaining Indebtedness.
 
On May 1, 2020, the parties entered into a second amendment to the Debt and Series H Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) pursuant to which Messrs. Sacramone and McMahon agreed to release and forever discharge the Remaining Indebtedness on the date on which the NYSE American Exchange files a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), delisting the Company’s common stock (the “Termination Date”), provided that in no event shall the Termination Date be any sooner than July 1, 2020 or any later than October 1, 2020. The NYSE American Exchange filed a Form 25 with the SEC delisting the Company’s common stock on May 21, 2020. Accordingly, the Remaining Indebtedness was released and discharged effective as of July 1, 2020.

Acquisition of Rental Home Portfolio 
 
On December 20, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement”) with (i) US Home Rentals, (ii) the holders (the “Equity Sellers”) of 100% of the equity interests in entities owned by the Equity Sellers that collectively hold a real estate asset portfolio consisting of approximately 3,200 rental homes located across the United States (the “Entities”), (iii) Vision Property Management, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (“Vision” and together with the Equity Sellers, the “Rental Home Portfolio Sellers”), and (iv) Alexander Szkaradek, in his capacity as the representative of the Rental Home Portfolio Sellers (the “Sellers’ Representative”). On December 30, 2019, the parties amended the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”) in order to address certain changes to the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement, including, among other things, to allow the $9,750,000 balance of the cash portion of the purchase price to be paid in short-term promissory notes(resulting in the issuance of a $4,875,000 note to Alex Szkaradek and a $4,875,000 note to Antoni Szkaradek (collectively, the “Szkaradek Notes”) , and to reduce the Rental Home Portfolio Sellers’ indemnification deductible to $100,000. On December 30, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the Entities pursuant to the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended.
 
Pursuant to the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended, US Homes Rentals LLC purchased (a) all of the equity interests in the Entities and (b) all of Vision’s assets that are related to its business, including certain assumed contracts and assumed intellectual property, excluding certain specified assets, for aggregate consideration of $350,000,000, consisting of (i) $250,000 of cash; (ii) $9,750,000 in promissory notes, payable on or before January 31, 2020, which date was extended to March 31, 2020 pursuant to a 60-day forbearance that was included in the promissory notes; (iii) the amount of outstanding indebtedness of the Entities, which was calculated at approximately $80,000,000; (iv) 4,222,474 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001, which the parties valued at $32,000,000; and (v) shares of a newly designated Series I Non-Convertible Preferred Stock having an aggregate stated value equal to 228,000,000, which is subject to adjustment. See Part II Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 “Asset Acquisition”
 
Divestiture of CrossLayer, Inc.
 
On January 16, 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “CrossLayer Purchase Agreement”) with CBFA Corporation, pursuant to which CBFA acquired the customer agreements which were of nominal value and largely cancelable without penalty, in exchange for agreeing to perform all of CrossLayer’s obligations under those agreements plus the assumption of approximately $73,000 in accounts payable and approximately $100,000 in long-term supplier contracts.
 
Delisting of Common Stock from the NYSE American Exchange
 
During 2019, the Company received a series of letters from the NYSE American concerning the Company’s failure to comply with various continued listing requirements under the NYSE American Company Guide. On December 17, 2019, as a result of a calculation error resulting in the issuance of more than 20% of the Company’s outstanding common stock without the requisite shareholder approval, the staff of NYSE Regulation (the “Staff”) notified the Company of its determination to initiate proceedings to delist the Company’s common stock from the Exchange and suspended trading of the Company’s common stock on the same day, citing public interest reasons.
 
The Company challenged the Staff’s decision as unfairly punitive in relation to the Company’s mistake, especially given that the Company took prompt and effective remedial actions to undo the issuance, rescinded the underlying agreement, and established new controls around the issuance of stock. Despite the Company’s efforts and repeated requests for reconsideration, and after exhausting multiple levels of appeal, on May 21, 2020, the Staff filed a Form 25 with the SEC to remove the Company’s common stock from listing and registration on the Exchange. The delisting became effective 10 days following the date of the Staff’s filing.
 
As of the date of the filing, the Company’s common stock is not quoted or trading on any stock market. The Company solicited the assistance of a prospective market maker who has expressed interest in sponsoring the Company’s Form 211 application with FINRA (subject to completing their due diligence) which would enable the Company’s common stock to resume trading on a trading platform operated by OTC Markets Group.
 
Notice of Default from Inmost Partners LLC
 
On July 1, 2020, the Company received a written notice of default (the “Notice of Default”) from Inmost Partners LLC in its capacity as Noteholder Agent (“Inmost”) to issuer noteholders who, collectively, hold approximately $51,564,000 in secured notes that the Company assumed from the Rental Home Portfolio Sellers in connection with the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement. Inmost asserted that certain events of default had occurred with respect to certain Note Issuance and Purchase Agreements each dated as of July 10, 2017 by and among, inter alia, certain Entities acquired by the Company, Inmost, and issuer noteholders named therein (the “Note Purchase Agreements”). Specifically, Inmost claimed that the Company (i) failed to satisfy the loan-to-value test (the “LTV Test”) as defined in the Note Purchase Agreements and (ii) failed to obtain consent from the Noteholder Agent before transferring the equity interests of certain Entities to US Home Rentals LLC (the “Equity Interest Transfer”) pursuant to the Rental Home Portfolio Asset Purchase Agreement. The Notice of Default also included certain demands by Inmost for additional capital contributions by the Company and Alex and Antoni Szkaradek (the “Guarantors”). 
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has cured the defaults associated with the LTV Test. Additionally, on November 3, 2020, Inmost granted its consent to the Equity Interest Transfer and rescinded the Default Notice in exchange for (i) a new guaranty agreement under which FTE Networks, Inc. and US Home Rentals LLC will jointly and severally guarantee the obligations of certain Entities under the Note Purchase Agreements, (ii) amendments to the Limited Liability Company Agreements for each of the subject Entities to provide for the appointment of a second manager of Noteholder Agent’s choosing, and (iii) amendments to the Note Purchase Agreements.


DLP Financing
 
On August 26, 2020, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Borrowers”) of US Home Rentals entered into seven separate loan agreements as part of a tranche of financing with DLP Lending Fund, LLC (the “Lender”) (each a “Loan Agreement” and collectively, the Loan Agreements”). The Lender had previously loaned an aggregate of $21,184,906 to the Equity Sellers. Pursuant to the Loan Agreements, the Borrowers issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $23,453,699 (the “DLP Tranche”). Proceeds from the DLP Tranche were used to refinance certain of the Borrower’s properties, pay outstanding property taxes, and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Loan Agreements. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the financing.

The Borrowers’ obligations to pay principal, interest and other amounts under the DLP Tranche are evidenced by promissory notes executed by the Borrowers as of August 26, 2020 (each a “Note” and collectively, the “Notes”). Each Note is secured by a first priority lien mortgage on certain of the Borrowers’ properties (the “Mortgaged Properties”) and confessions of judgment. Each Note will mature on August 31, 2021, subject to one-year extensions at the Borrowers’ option and other conditions. The Borrowers may prepay the outstanding loan amount in whole or in part by written notice of such prepayment to Lender, subject to certain conditions. The Company also executed certain Environmental Indemnity Agreements and certain Guaranty Agreements in connection with each Loan Agreement in favor of the Lenders pursuant to which the Company and Guarantors agreed to indemnify the Lenders for certain environmental risks and guaranty the Borrowers’ obligations under the Loan Agreements. 
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2020, the Company, together with its subsidiaries, has 66 full-time employees and contractor staff and no part-time employees. The number of employees and job-site contractors varies according to the level of the Company’s work in progress. The Company maintains a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and adds employees and job-site contractors as needed to complete specific projects.
Intellectual Property 
 
The Company has trademarks, trade names and licenses that it believes are necessary for the operation of its business as it is currently conducted. The Company does not consider its trademarks, trade names or licenses to be material to the operation of the business.
