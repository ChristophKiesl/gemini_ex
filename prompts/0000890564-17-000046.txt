Item 1. Business
Overview and History
On Assignment, Inc. (NYSE: ASGN), is a leading global provider of highly skilled, hard-to-find professionals in the growing technology, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, where quality people are the key to success. We go beyond matching résumés with job descriptions, to match people we know into positions we understand, for contract, contract-to-hire and direct hire assignments.
We were incorporated in 1985 and commenced operation of our first contract staffing line of business, which is now our Apex Life Sciences, LLC subsidiary (“Apex Life Sciences”). Expansion into other professional staffing markets has been achieved through acquisitions and internal growth. The following is a summary of significant acquisitions in the past five years:

• | On June 5, 2015, we acquired the holding company of Creative Circle, LLC (“Creative Circle”). Creative Circle, which is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, was purchased to expand our digital and creative staffing services. Creative Circle is included in the Apex operating segment.


• | On December 5, 2013, we acquired the holding company of CyberCoders, Inc. (“CyberCoders”), a privately-owned provider of permanent placement services headquartered in Irvine, California. CyberCoders is included in the Oxford operating segment.


• | On May 15, 2012, we acquired Apex Systems, LLC (“Apex Systems”), a privately-owned provider of information technology staffing and services headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Apex Systems is in the Apex operating segment.

Significant divestitures in the past five years include the sale of our Physician segment on February 1, 2015, and the sale of our Nurse Travel and Allied Healthcare divisions in 2013. In this 2016 10-K, these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for all periods presented.
Financial information regarding our operating segments and our domestic and international revenues is included under “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8 of this 2016 10-K.
Our principal office is located at 26745 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas, California 91301 and our telephone number is (818) 878-7900. We have approximately 158 branch offices within the United States and in seven foreign countries.

Industry and Market Dynamics
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) updates their employment estimates every two years, and based on their most recent December 2015 projections, they estimate total U.S. employment will grow by 9.8 million jobs, or 6.5 percent, between 2014 and 2024. By comparison, under the previous estimate for 2012 to 2022, BLS projected total employment would grow by 15.6 million jobs, or 11.0 percent. The decrease in projected growth from the prior period is primarily due to the aging of the U.S. population and more people retiring, resulting in a decrease in the labor force participation rate and growth rate.
In their September 2016 U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast report, Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) estimated total U.S. staffing industry revenues were $133.4 billion in 2015 and were projected to be $139.0 billion in 2016 and $144.9 billion in 2017. The largest industry segment, temporary staffing, is forecast to grow at an annual rate of four percent in 2017 with revenues of $124.8 billion, while permanent placement is forecast to grow six percent in 2017 with revenues of $20.1 billion. Within the temporary segment, professional staffing is expected to grow at an annual rate of six percent in 2017 with revenues of $72.3 billion. The temporary staffing industry is historically cyclical and typically has a strong correlation to employment and gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth.
Specific to the professional temporary staffing markets where On Assignment’s businesses are concentrated, the SIA report projects the U.S. information technology (“IT”) temporary staffing market will increase six percent, marketing/creative will increase seven percent, engineering/design will increase one percent and clinical/scientific will increase five percent in 2017.
We anticipate clients for our technology, digital, life sciences and creative staffing services will increase their use of contract labor through professional staffing firms to meet the need for increases in capacity of their workforce. By using outsourced labor, these clients will benefit from cost structure advantages, improved flexibility to address fluctuating demand in business and access to greater expertise.
Clients 
We serve our clients by effectively understanding their staffing needs and providing them qualified professionals with the unique combination of skills, experience and expertise to meet those needs. We believe effective engagements of contract technology, digital, life sciences and creative professionals require the people involved in making assignments to have significant knowledge of the client’s industry and the ability to assess the specific needs of the client as well as the contract professionals’ qualifications. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we provided contract professionals to approximately 14,000 clients. In 2016, no single client represented more than seven percent of our revenues.

When clients use independent contractors, they face the potential risk of worker misclassification and resulting liability of federal and state taxes, wage and hour, immigration, diversity, employee rights and other laws and regulations. That risk can be significantly mitigated and clients can stay compliant with ever-changing employment laws and regulations by working with a reputable staffing firm like On Assignment.
Our clients set rigorous requirements for the talent they are seeking, and we use our extensive databases and deep relationships with our contract professionals to quickly identify and pre-screen candidates whose qualifications meet those requirements. We are responsible for recruiting, verifying credentials upon request, hiring, administering pay and benefits, compliance and training as applicable. Clients select the candidate and control and direct the work of contract professionals and approve hours worked. Once on their assignment, contract professionals are generally our employees, although clients provide on-the-job supervision of these professionals.
Candidates 
The candidates we recruit are technical, scientific, digital and creative professionals looking for either contract work or permanent placement opportunities.
Hourly wage or contract rates for our contract professionals are established based on their specific skills and whether or not the assignment involves travel away from their primary residence.  For our contract employees, we pay the related costs of employment including social security taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other similar costs. After achieving minimum service periods and/or hours worked, our contract employees are offered access to medical and other voluntary benefit programs (e.g., dental, vision, disability) and the right to participate in our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Each contract professional’s employment relationship with us is terminable at will.
Professionals looking for a permanent placement may apply directly for open positions within a company or partner with a staffing agency to ensure they receive the best opportunities available in their industry. Candidates may work with one or more staffing companies during this process and often develop long-term relationships with their recruiter for future career advancement. Once placed in a permanent position, the professional is paid and receives benefits directly through the employer.
Strategy
On Assignment’s strategy is to identify, enter and be a dominant player in the most attractive segments of the professional staffing market through acquisition, organic growth and effective execution. Our financial goals are to grow our business to $3.0 billion in revenues by 2018 while maintaining attractive margins and earnings per share (“EPS”) growth. To achieve these goals we will continue our specialization in the large and growing technology, life sciences, digital and creative segments of the professional staffing market; reinforce our position as a dominant competitor in each; invest primarily in domestic markets; and pursue further disciplined acquisitions.
Our strategic innovation efforts and technology investments focus on putting the best productivity tools in the hands of our Account Executives and Recruiters, and we continue delivering world class services that make working with On Assignment easy for our clients. We continually respond to emerging trends in digitization, technology and candidate sourcing by using technology to better position our businesses and improve how we serve clients and consultants.
We consolidate our corporate support services - finance, accounting, human resources, legal, marketing and IT - in centralized locations where we can most effectively and efficiently perform these functions, allowing us to leverage our fixed costs and generate higher incremental earnings as our revenues grow. In addition, we invest in leasehold improvements as we expand, relocate and rationalize our branch facilities to increase the productivity of our staffing consultants.
In 2016, we continued to focus on increasing market share in each of our businesses, expanding our service offerings and controlling our operating costs. We also substantially added to the number of staffing consultants we employed. Over the course of the year, the average number of recruiters and sales personnel we employed increased 13 percent.
Competition
We compete with other large publicly-held and privately-owned staffing companies on an international, national, regional and local basis. Each of our businesses has unique competitors, and further details are provided within the Operating Segments section below.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates for temporary employment or permanent placements are contract rates, salaries and benefits; availability and variety of opportunities; quality, duration and location of assignments; and responsiveness to requests for placement. Many people seeking temporary employment or permanent placements through us are also pursuing employment through other means, including other staffing agencies. Therefore, the speed at which we assign prospective professionals and the availability of attractive and appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to fill open positions. In addition to having high quality candidates to assign in a timely manner, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients in the staffing industry are properly assessing the clients’ specific job requirements, the appropriateness of the professional assigned to the client, the price of services and monitoring our clients’ satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition to continue to increase.

Oxford Global Resources
Oxford specializes in recruiting and delivering experienced IT, engineering and regulatory and compliance consultants to clients for temporary assignments. These consultants typically have a great deal of knowledge and experience in specialized technical fields which make them uniquely qualified to fill a given assignment. Our competitive advantage comes from our recruiting-driven business process that results in our ability to respond very quickly with high quality candidates to a client's request, thus Oxford's tagline “The Right Talent. Right Now®.” Demand for Oxford's services is driven by a shortage of experienced consultants with specialized technical skills that organizations need quickly but cannot find on their own. Additionally, the push for adoption of health information technology, compliance with FDA regulations and increasing digitization of business processes is accelerating the demand for services. Our services are provided to clients in a wide range of industries and range from large companies that may, for example, be installing new enterprise-wide computer systems and have a need for a subject matter expert with a specific technical and industry-specific experience, to small and mid-sized companies, such as a medical device manufacturer who needs a specialized hardware engineer. Assignments for Oxford typically vary from two to eight months.
Oxford's sales and recruiting activities are delivered through eight recruiting centers across the United States and two in Europe, along with 16 local offices serving major metropolitan markets in the United States.
