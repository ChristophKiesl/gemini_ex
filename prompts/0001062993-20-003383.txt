 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We design, develop and sell software and services that enable enterprises and telecommunication service providers to deliver Unified Communications & Collaborations (UCC) solutions to their end users. Our offerings include softphones that support HD voice/video calling, messaging, and presence from a wide range of call services and VoIP services, as well as hosted services for team voice, messaging, presence, video conferencing and screen sharing functionality, over Internet Protocol (IP) based networks. We are capitalizing upon several industry trends, including the rapid adoption of mobile technology, the proliferation of work-from-home programs, the growth of video conferencing, the increasing requirements for secure business communications, centralized cloud-based provisioning, and the migration towards all IP networks. We are also capitalizing on a trend where communication services such as Google Meet, Slack, Zoom, and WhatsApp are becoming more available over-the-top (OTT) of the incumbent operators' networks or enterprise networks (a.k.a. Internet OTT providers). We consolidate Internet OTT application capabilities into a single application that, we believe, provides more value at less than our competitors' cost. Our solutions are offered under perpetual license agreements that generate one-time license revenue and under subscription license agreements that generate recurring license revenue. Our solutions are available for sale through our online store, directly using our in-house sales team, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) partners, and through traditional value added reseller (VAR) and value added distributer (VAD) channel partners. Enterprises typically leverage our solutions to increase employee productivity and to reduce communication costs while leveraging, leading call servers provided by companies such as Cisco, Avaya, Sangoma, and others. Telecommunication service providers typically deploy our solutions to supplement and add value to their traditional services that compete directly with the Internet OTT providers.  Our OEM and VAR customers typically integrate our solutions into their products and then sell a bundled solution to their end customers, which include both telecommunication service providers and enterprises.
 Our business model focuses on winning new customers, expanding sales of new and existing products and services to existing customers, and renewing subscriptions and software support agreements. We target business customers of all sizes and across a range of industries, including call centers, financial services, government, retail, technology and telecommunications. We have sold software and services to more than 700 different customers in over 73 countries, including some of the world's largest businesses, global financial institutions and leading telecommunication service providers (where each customer has purchased at least $10,000 of software and services).
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 18, 2003.
 Our principal executive offices are located at Suite 300, 505 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V7X 1M3. Our telephone number is (604) 320-3344. Our website address is www.counterpath.com.

 Industry
 The telecommunication industry continues to undergo a fundamental transition from legacy circuit switched networks to packet switched networks that are more flexible and economical to operate.  At the same time, consumers and businesses are rapidly adopting new mobile and cloud communication technologies (a.k.a. Internet OTT providers). The global cloud communication platform market is expected to grow by US$10.3 billion between 2019 and 2025, supported by momentum driven by unified communication and collaboration market growth potential of 28.9%. This unified communication and collaboration market is expected to reach US$7.7 billion by 2025 (Research and Markets, February 2020). We believe enterprises want to capitalize upon these trends by launching innovative OTT services to increase employee mobility, increase employee productivity, and reduce communication costs.  At the same time, telecommunication service providers are facing several threats, including:
  5



the commoditization of their legacy voice businesses;


the decline in short message service (SMS) revenues;


regulatory changes that increase competition and reduce revenues; and the proliferation of third-party OTT services.


 Given these factors, some telecommunication service providers are looking to defend their businesses by launching their own innovative OTT services to counter some of the threats they are facing and to create new revenue streams. Additionally, both enterprises and telecommunication service providers are looking to simplify their IT operations by procuring cloud-based services rather than purchasing systems outright and running them independently.  The migration towards cloud-based services typically reduces up-front capital expenditures and simplifies IT operations. 
 Enterprises are adopting mobile technology at a rapid pace. It is estimated that by 2025, nearly 3.7 billion people globally will use smartphones to access the internet (CNBC, January 2019). We believe enterprises want to leverage mobile technology to increase employee productivity and to reduce costs, as well as support remote work and work-from-home initiatives. At the same time, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) to work programs are becoming common in the workplace, with over 70% of organizations in the U.S. reporting BYOD usage (Frost & Sullivan, August 2018). BYOD enables enterprises to reduce up-front technology acquisition costs, while allowing employees to work on their device of choice. This rapid penetration of mobile technology in the work place, coupled with the need to support and manage an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices, creates new challenges for IT organizations, including the need to extend the corporate IT environment to the mobile device, the ability to provide and manage corporate applications remotely, and the need for secure communications. IT departments are often challenged to give users the benefits of mobility while simultaneously satisfying enterprise security and compliance requirements. Our solutions address these issues by enabling enterprises to launch what we call "Enterprise OTT Services." Our BriaÂ® mobile softphones allow mobile workers to leverage the full suite of corporate PBX (call server) functionality as if they were in the office and connected to the secure enterprise network. In addition, our Bria Desktop softphones enable users to replace or augment their traditional desk phones cost-effectively. Our Stretto PlatformTM increases the value of the Bria softphones by offering user management, messaging and presence services, video conferencing, and collaboration services. The single platform increases productivity through the creation of services such as messaging, presence, video conferencing and screen sharing that can overlay with the current offering. Our Stretto Platform's user management capabilities provide powerful provisioning capabilities that help centrally manage user settings by the IT organization. IT managers can also leverage user analytics and help desk tools to reduce support costs.
 Enterprises are adapting to the new and increasingly complex environments by shifting away from purchasing stand-alone software applications and running them on in-house servers to purchasing cloud-based services. This approach typically reduces capital spending and simplifies operations by reducing the number of servers and applications IT staff must install, configure, manage and support. Our Stretto Platform may be deployed as cloud-based services that generate recurring revenue for our company. We also offer a complete cloud-based solution to small, medium and large enterprises. For individuals, we launched Bria Solo that enables users to download and use up to three softphones with limited provisioning capabilities for paid users. There is also a feature limited version that is free for users which includes a single softphone. The free version of Bria Solo replaces our X-Lite product and is used as a marketing tool to promote our paid offerings. Each Bria Solo user, paid or free, registers with the CounterPath online store to enable services. For small to medium sized enterprises, we launched a subscription service known as Bria Teams, delivering centralized provisioning, voice and video calls between team members, messaging, presence, screen sharing, video conferencing and collaboration from the cloud, along with up to three Bria softphones per user. This solution is available exclusively through our on-line store. For the medium and large-sized businesses we offer Bria EnterpriseTM, which is sold through channel partners and our direct sales team under either a perpetual or a subscription licensing agreement and includes our Bria softphones and access to our Stretto Platform. The Stretto Platform supports user management, messaging, presence, video conferencing, and collaboration. Bria Enterprise enables enterprises to quickly launch unified communications that overlay their current on-premises and hosted call server offerings.
 Telecommunication service providers, including cable, wireless, and Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSPs) are also facing a shifting landscape driven by new technology and changing subscriber habits. Some wireline and cable subscribers are "cutting the cord" and cancelling their home-phone service in favour of cellular service. At the same time, video OTT services such as Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix have gained significant traction, leading some subscribers to cancel their television service or down grade to less expensive bundles, placing additional pressure on top-line revenues at some service providers.  Mobile subscribers, on the other hand, are scaling back their use of certain services such as SMS and international long-distance voice in favour of third-party OTT services such as WhatsApp and WeChat.  We believe many telecommunication service providers aim to strengthen subscriber relationships, reduce churn and prevent or slow revenue erosion by launching their own, superior, white labelled "Operator OTT Services" with unique value added features that are difficult for third-parties to replicate.  Our Operator Solutions enable service providers to provision single identity, one number services that increase a subscriber's usage of their home or cellular phone number, convergence services that facilitate call handoff between different access networks, Voice over IP services for inexpensive long-distance calling when roaming, and messaging services for efficient communications.

Products
 Our solutions comprise of software products and cloud based services. Our software products include applications for desktop computers, mobile devices, and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for software developers seeking to add voice, video and messaging capabilities to their existing applications. We also offer server-based software solutions for provisioning, managing and supporting Bria applications, and for deploying advanced messaging, video conferencing and collaboration services. Many of these software products are also available to customers in the form of cloud based hosted services. 
Softphones
 Our softphone applications support voice, video, messaging, presence and collaboration services over IP networks. Our softphone applications have undergone rigorous interoperability testing against leading PBXs, SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) application servers and IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) cores, ensuring that our softphone applications can be readily deployed in our customers' networks. In addition to maintaining certification with leading SIP infrastructure vendors (such as Cisco, Avaya and Genesys), our softphone applications are tightly integrated with solutions from Salesforce.com, Microsoft, AirWatch (a VMware company), and Blackberry (formerly Good Technologies), to name a few. We have performed integration with leading USB headset and Bluetooth device vendors, including Poly, Jabra, Logitech and Sennheiser, to provide advanced levels of functionality when deployed in conjunction with CounterPath products.

Bria Desktop (Windows, Mac) and Bria Mobile (iOS, Android)

 The Bria softphone suite enables consumers and business users to make VoIP audio and video calls, send Instant Messages and manage their presence, share their screen (desktop only) and collaborate with other users, all in an easy-to-use software application. The product suite works on desktop computers and laptops, smartphones, Chromebooks and tablets (including Windows tablet devices such as Microsoft Surface Pro), using various operating systems.
 Using the latest technology and SIP standards, our softphone applications provide business users with carrier-grade communication solutions that can be tailored to meet the needs of any size organization. For larger customers, we offer the ability to customize our softphone application by allowing our customers to include their corporate logos and branding, as well as to select specific features to be included that is not part of the core product. We have developed an on-line branding portal to allow customers to efficiently customize and configure their applications.
 
VoIP Softphone SDK

 Our SDK is targeted at developers that are seeking to build a unique communication application or incorporate advanced unified communications capabilities into their existing applications.  For example, there is demand within the healthcare and call center vertical industries for adding unified communication capabilities to applications that enable specific use cases. Our SDK can support a number of industries, including the retail, healthcare, logistics, transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, and call-center verticals.
  7

Our SDK delivers standards-compliant voice, video, messaging, and presence capabilities for Windows and Mac desktop and iOS and Android mobile devices, and can be integrated into existing applications with a minimal amount of development effort. We also offer a voice-only SDK for Linux. Our SDK can also be deployed with our Stretto Platform for customers seeking to leverage Stretto capabilities such as centralized provisioning or other advanced softphone metrics.  Our SDK is used in our own softphone products, thereby delivering the benefit of our experience in deploying millions of SIP softphone clients.  As an important differentiator, we provide customers with direct access to our engineering team, to ensure technical issues are quickly resolved.
 Stretto Platform
 The Stretto Platform (Stretto) is a carrier-grade software platform for enterprises and service providers; it is also a key component of our Stretto Collaboration (video conferencing) services, Bria Solo, Bria Teams and Bria Enterprise offerings.
 The Stretto Platform is agnostic to existing network elements, enabling deployments to be made on top of existing session border controllers, IMS components, VoIP switches, PBXs and cloud communication services.
 The Stretto Platform includes a number of modules that can be separately purchased by customers, including:
 

Stretto Collaboration: Stretto Collaboration combines HD audio and video conferencing, screen-sharing, and messaging, in one virtual meeting room that enhances the Bria softphone experience.  It includes feature-rich hosting tools that enables presenters to toggle video views on the fly, invite participants ad hoc, and extend presenter capabilities to other Bria participants. Participants to conferences are able to join via Bria, web browser, or dial in number, offering flexibility for communications with users outside of the organization.


Provisioning: Stretto Provisioning enables the IT or operations staff of an organization to deploy, provision, and manage ongoing configuration upgrades to Bria softphones.  The organization can control over 500 settings, including default codec selection, NAT traversal settings and keep-alive timer values as specified by IT or operations staff.  This module is responsible for authenticating end users, and includes integration with the enterprise's existing directory services using protocols such as LDAP and OAuth.


User Experience Metrics (UEM) and Analytics: Stretto UEM enables the IT or operations staff of an organization to record and analyze critical analytics and Voice Quality Monitoring (VQM) data that summarizes service quality, device usage, feature usage, and device characteristics.

Bria Solo, Bria Teams, and Bria Enterprise
 Our Bria Solo, Bria Teams, and Bria Enterprise products combine the Bria softphone suite for desktops, Chromebooks, smartphones and tablets with our cloud-hosted Stretto Platform. Bria Solo was launched in 2020 to replace our free X-Lite offering and provide an offering for individual users wanting to deploy their own softphones for use against any SIP-based call sever. Bria Teams was launched in 2018 as a subscription service, delivering centralized provisioning, messaging, presence, screen sharing, video conferencing, and collaboration from the cloud, along with up to three Bria softphones per user; this solution is available exclusively through our on-line store. For medium and large businesses, we offer Bria Enterprise, which is sold through channel partners and our direct sales team. 
 Bria Teams is a solution targeted at small businesses allowing them to cost effectively extend the benefits of unified communications softphone technology to all employees, across all devices and networks with the aim of increasing the productivity and responsiveness of every employee.  By simplifying the provisioning process, team administrators can quickly and easily configure team members via the cloud; users simply download our Bria Teams application to each of their devices, enter their credentials and within seconds, can start collaborating with fellow employees, partners and customers.  Bria Teams delivers a suite of hosted collaboration services including Instant Messaging and Presence, Screen Sharing and Virtual Meeting Room capabilities to broaden our value beyond traditional softphones. Bria Teams was a recipient of the TMC 2019 UC Product of the Year, as well as a finalist for the NoJitter Best of Enterprise Connect award alongside Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx Room Kit Mini, and Amazon Web Services.
 Through the use of our Bria Enterprise application, enterprises, service providers and telecommunication channel partners are able to leverage the Stretto Platform for procuring, distributing, provisioning and managing Bria Enterprise softphones from the cloud, as well as offering hosted messaging and collaboration solutions. The Stretto Platform provides customers with an easy-to-use system accessible through either the Stretto Administrator web interface or an API. Most softphone settings, outside of some user preferences, are hidden; instead the softphone relies on our provisioning capability to provision these settings remotely. This enables administrators to centrally manage all of their communications across all device platforms. Bria Enterprise has won recent awards, including the TMC 2020 Internet Telephony Product of the Year and 2020 CUSTOMER Magazine Product of the Year.
 The softphone clients in our Bria Solo, Bria Teams and Bria Enterprise offerings are updated with the most current release and available as a download from the Apple iTunes store, Google Play, or direct download links (for desktop).  Our softphone offers high-quality VoIP communications, delivered in an intuitive user interface, and includes premium features such as video calling, messaging and presence and premium audio and video codecs.
 Bria Teams and Bria Enterprise also provide customers with access to hosted messaging and hosted collaboration services.
 Sales and Marketing
 We derive revenue from the sale of software licenses (perpetual and software as a service), software customization services, technical support services associated with the software licenses, implementation services, training services, and cloud-based services. We recognize perpetual software and services revenue at the time of delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We recognize software as a service revenue over the term of the service contract, which is generally twelve months.
 We focus on selling our software products to enterprises via a variety of go-to-market channels. Our customers and partners include: (1) small, medium and large sized enterprises; (2) telecommunications service providers and Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs) ; (3) channel partners, including original equipment manufacturers, value added distributors and value added resellers, serving the telecommunication market; and (4) end users who purchase our applications directly from our online store or from third party online stores.  To date, we have sold software and services to more than 700 different customers in over 73 countries, including some of the world's largest businesses, global financial institutions and leading telecommunication service providers (where each customer has purchased at least $10,000 of software and services).

We typically work with our larger customers to streamline the process of delivering our software to their end users.  This includes customization and pre-configuring the information required to connect to the customer's network and enabling or disabling certain features of our products.  Our software products are typically co-labelled with our brand and our customer's brand, or privately labelled with our customer's brand.  Co-labelling of our products means that the user interface that displays on the device screen for the end user to see remains as is, but the customer's brand is also placed on the user interface.  Private labelling of our products means that the customer can request that we change many of the features shown on the user interface and can remove all references to our company from the user interface.  We receive professional service revenue for configuration and customization of our software.
 Marketing
 Our products are marketed through a variety of means including by:
 

our customers and partners;


advertising on our website, social media channels and search engines;


direct market campaigns;


co-marketing with our partners, suppliers and customers;


webinars and content marketing strategies;


offering trial use of Bria Solo, our free softphone with fewer features than our commercial versions; and


attending industry trade shows.


Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections to protect our intellectual property.
 We own or hold the exclusive license to 20 U.S. patents with counterparts granted or pending in other jurisdictions around the world.  In addition, we are pursuing one in-house developed patent application with counterparts pending in other jurisdictions around the world.
 We also hold a number of registered trademarks in the United States.
 In addition to the protections described above, we generally control access to, and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls.  These controls include contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners.  Our software is protected by U.S. and certain international copyright laws.
 We hold the exclusive right to certain technologies developed at Columbia University for which we pay a license fee of 5% of net revenues where the technologies are incorporated into the products we sell.  We incorporate a number of third party software programs into our software applications pursuant to license agreements.
 We may not receive competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around the patents owned or licensed by us. Our existing and future patents may be circumvented, blocked, licensed to others or challenged as to inventorship, ownership, scope, validity or enforceability. Furthermore, our pending and future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of claims sought by us, if at all, or the scope of claims we are seeking may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Moreover, we have adopted a strategy of seeking limited patent protection with respect to the technologies used in or relating to our products.  If our products, patents or patent applications are found to conflict with any patents held by third parties, we could be prevented from selling our products, our patents may be declared invalid or our patent applications may not result in issued patents. In foreign countries, we may not receive effective patent, copyright and trademark protection. We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party's patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, in the future we may be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, as described in "Risk Factors - Risks Associated with our Business and Industry" - "We may in the future be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the continued viability of our company" and "We could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any proprietary technology and intellectual property rights against infringement, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly".
  10

We license our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on customers' ability to use the software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements and by restricting access to our source code. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties.
 Research and Development
 Development of our products is primarily done through our Canadian wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath Technologies Inc., and our U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary, CounterPath, LLC.  Our research and development team consists of a core software development department and a quality assurance department.  Core software development is responsible for designing, developing and maintaining our software across our supported operating systems.  Quality assurance is responsible for testing the software before release to customers on all of our platforms.  Total research and development expenditures for the year ended April 30, 2020 were $4,398,814 (2019- $5,547,587).
After Sales Service and Support
 We sell our software on an as-is or limited warranty basis to end users, and we are not required to update or upgrade the software nor are we generally responsible for failure of our software to work on our customer's computer network; however, we offer two levels of renewable annual support to our non-end user customers for a specified percentage of the software license fees.
 During the one-year period following the date of sale, basic support includes:

 In circumstances where we provide a warranty on our software, we warrant that our software will perform substantially in accordance with the materials accompanying the software for periods of up to twelve months from the date of sale to cover defects in workmanship.
Competition
 There are numerous developers that compete with our company for market share.  Small software development companies typically compete on the basis of price, while large original equipment manufacturers typically compete by selling their proprietary software applications as a component to an overall proprietary communications system.  We compete by offering applications with extensive features that are compatible with a broad spectrum of communication systems and with various devices and operating systems.
Government Approval
 We have obtained Export Commodity Classification Numbers from the United States government for our software that contains encryption technology.  We use these classifications to determine whether export licenses are required to export our software to foreign countries.  We are not aware of any permits that are specific to our industry which are required in order for our company to operate or to sell our products and services in such jurisdictions.
