Item 1. Business
General Information

We are a development stage company with limited revenues and a short operating history. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our focus for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 will be on pursuing other business opportunities to increase shareholder value. 

Emerging Growth Company Status under the JOBS Act

American Oil & Gas Inc. (“AO&G”) qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). 

The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuers known as “emerging growth companies.” Emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion (as indexed for inflation) during their most recently completed fiscal year. The JOBS Act is intended to facilitate public offerings by emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and its regulations. An emerging growth company will retain that status until the earliest of:

· | The first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed $1 billion; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its IPO; 
· | The date on which the company has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period; and
· | The first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least $700 million. 

Financial and Audit Requirements

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements. Pursuant to these scaled requirements, emerging growth companies may:


· | Provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their IPO Registration Statement; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required;
· | Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and 
· | Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditor’s attestation regarding the issuer’s internal controls.

Offering Requirements

In addition, during the IPO offering process, emerging growth companies are exempt from:


· | Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the IPO registration statement; and 
· | The requirement initially to publicly file IPO Registration Statements. Emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft Registration Statements and any amendments with the SEC. Public filings of the draft documents must be made at least 21 days prior to commencement of the IPO “road show.”

Other Public Company Requirements

Emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:


· | The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and 
· | The requirements under Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. 


We have a total of 75,000,000 authorized common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share with 20,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2021.
