Overview
 
We were originally formed under the name “Andina Acquisition Corporation” for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On March 22, 2012, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”), and on December 20, 2013, we consummated our initial business combination (the “Merger”), whereby our wholly-owned subsidiary merged with and into Tecnoglass Holding. As a result of the Merger, Tecnoglass Holding and its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tecnoglass and ES, became our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, the business of Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries became our business. We are now a holding company operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Tecnoglass Holding being considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger. For accounting and financial purposes, we were treated as the acquired company, and Tecnoglass Holding was treated as the acquiring company. Accordingly, historical information, including historical financial information and the historical description of our business, for periods and dates prior to December 20, 2013, include information for Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries.
 
In December 2016, as part of our strategy to vertically integrate our operations, we acquired 100% of the stock of ESW LLC, 85.06% of which was acquired directly by the Company and 14.94% by our subsidiary ES, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, which consisted of (i) 734,400 ordinary shares issued in connection with the transaction for approximately $9.2 million based on a stock price of $12.50, (ii) approximately $2.3 million in cash, and (iii) approximately $2.0 million related to the assignment of certain accounts receivable.
 
As the Acquisition of ESW LLC was deemed to be a transaction between entities under common control, the assets and liabilities were transferred at the historical cost of ESW LLC, with prior periods retroactively adjusted to include the historical financial results of the acquired company for the period they were controlled by the previous owners of ESW LLC in the Company’s financial statements. The following information includes the financial information as originally reported and as adjusted.

Our Business
 
General
 
We are a leading manufacturer of hi-spec architectural glass and windows for the western hemisphere residential and commercial construction industries, operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Headquartered in Barranquilla, Colombia, we operate out of a 2.7 million square foot vertically-integrated, state-of-the-art manufacturing complex that provides easy access to the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.
 
We sell our products to more than 900 customers in North, Central and South America. The United States accounted for approximately 62% and 59% of our combined revenues in 2016 and 2015, respectively, while Colombia accounted for approximately 32% and 34%, and Panama for approximately 3% and 3% of our combined revenues in those years, respectively. Our tailored, high-end products are found on some of the world’s most distinctive properties, including the 50 UN Plaza (New York), UB Law (Baltimore) Fordham University Law School (New York), Soho Mall (Panama), Brickell City Centre (Miami), Wesleyan (Houston) and the El Dorado Airport (Bogota).

The Company is a leading manufacturer of a variety of glass products installed primarily in commercial and residential buildings, including tempered safety, double thermo-acoustic and laminated glass. Tecnoglass products are installed in hotels, residential buildings, commercial and corporate centers, universities, airports and hospitals in a variety of applications such as floating facades, curtain walls, windows, doors, handrails, interior and bathroom spatial dividers. In 2015 Tecnoglass established its Solartec plant, to produce low emissivity glass with high thermal insulation specifications using soft coat technology.
 
Tecnoglass also produces aluminum products such as profiles, rods, bars, plates and other hardware used in the manufacture of windows. In 2007, Tecnoglass established its Alutions plant in Barranquilla, Colombia for extrusion, smelting, painting and anodizing processes, and for exporting, importing and marketing aluminum products. The Alutions plant contributes all of the raw materials needed for production of Tecnoglass aluminum products.
 
Glass Magazine ranked Tecnoglass as the second largest glass fabricator serving the U.S. market in 2016. We believe that it is the leading glass transformation company in Colombia, capturing 40% of the market share in the country by sales and volume.
 
The Company is also a leader in the production of high-end windows, with more than 33 years of experience in the glass and aluminum structure assembly market in Colombia. The Company designs, manufactures, markets and installs architectural systems for high, medium and low rise construction, glass and aluminum windows and doors, office dividers and interiors, floating facades and commercial display windows.
 
The Company has an important and dominant presence in the Florida market, which has historically represented (and continues to represent) a substantial portion of our total sales and backlog. The Company grew in the Florida market not only through sustained organic growth, but also through the asset acquisitions of Glasswall LLC and RC Aluminum, both in 2014, and the recent acquisition of ESW (formerly a related party), which would reinforce our vertical integration strategy and expansion strategy into U.S. markets. ES has expanded its U.S. sales outside of the Florida market for windows, and into the high-tech market for curtain walls, a product that is in high demand and we believe represents a new trend in architecture, and floating façades. For example, it has been used in El Dorado Airport (Bogotá), University of Baltimore Law School (Baltimore) and Via 57 West (New York). Due to the sophistication of these new products, we believe that we can generate higher margins through the sale of curtain walls as compared to traditional window frames or floor-to-ceiling windows. Curtain walls produced by the Company are composed of high performance materials produced by Alutions, our aluminum smelting plant, and our glass treatment plant.
 
In 2014, we established two entities in South Florida, Tecno LLC and Tecno RE, to acquire manufacturing and warehousing facilities, customer lists and exclusive design permits in order to support sales growth in the United States. We will continue to manufacture our products at our facilities in Barranquilla, Colombia while performing select manufacturing and light assembly in the U.S. to enhance client service and create certain cost efficiencies.
 
In Panama, ES sells products primarily to companies participating in large construction projects in the exclusive areas of Panama City. For example, ES products were supplied in the construction of the tallest building in Central and South America, The Point, as well as in the construction of other modern hotels in the region, such as Megapolis, and in the development of the Soho Plaza, a complex consisting of a shopping mall and two skyscrapers.
 
As part of our strategy to vertically integrate our operations, on December 2, 2016 we acquired 100% of the stock of ESW LLC, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million. Since 2004, we have a strategic commercial relationship with ESW LLC, a Florida-based company partially owned by Christian T. Daes and José M. Daes, who are also our executive officers and directors, up onto recent acquisition. ESW LLC acts as one of ES’s importers and distributors in the U.S. and is a member of the American Architectural Manufacturers Association, a technical information center for the architecture industry with highest standards. ESW LLC sends project specifications and orders from its clients to ES, and in turn, receives pricing quotes from ES which are conveyed to the client.
 
As a subsequent event, on March 1, 2017, the Company entered into and consummated a purchase agreement with Giovanni Monti, the owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of GM&P. GM&P is a consulting and glazing contracting company located in Miami, Florida with over 15 years of experience in the design and installation of various building enclosure systems such as curtain window walls and a long-standing commercial relationship with the Company, working alongside it in different projects within the U.S, by providing engineering and installation services to those projects. The Company acquired all of the shares of GM&P for a purchase price of $35 million, of which the Company will pay $6 million of the purchase price in cash within the 60 days following the closing date and the remaining $29 million of the purchase price to be payable on or before September 1, 2017 in cash, our ordinary shares or a combination of both, at our sole option.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Vertical Integration
 
We believe we are unique in vertically integrating the purchase of raw materials, the manufacture of glass and aluminum products and the subsequent production and distribution of customized glass and windows for architectural and industrial settings. By vertically integrating these functions, we are able to price our products competitively while maintaining strict quality control measures to guarantee the high quality of our products. Additionally, we benefit from significant advantages in efficiency and time-to-market for new or customized products. This vertically integrated model provides attractive margins with significant operating leverage.

Ideally situated, with easy access to cost-efficient transport hubs
 
Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in Barranquilla, Colombia, which is strategically located near three of the country’s major ports: Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta. These ports, which are no more than two hours’ drive from each other, provide us with maritime access to all major markets globally. The Barranquilla port is just 16 kilometers away from our production facilities, and shipping to Miami’s main port is a three-day journey, six days to New York and 11 days to Los Angeles (through the Panama Canal). Our location provides a significant competitive advantage in light of the relatively low cost of shipping our products from Barranquilla to the U.S. (particularly Florida) as compared to our main competitors located elsewhere, even including our competitors located in Midwest U.S. In addition to very positive impact on cost structure, our strategic location allows us to be more responsive to our customers’ requirements.
 
High Barriers to Entry
 
Entry into many of the markets that we serve is limited due to the technical certifications required on high specification building projects such as IGCC, IqNet Icontec 14001 and ISO9001. Our success in those markets is due in large part to our ability to produce sophisticated products, the breadth of our product offering and our reputation for delivering high quality, made-to-order architectural glass on time. These factors are required to compete successfully for multimillion dollar projects typical of our business. Given the vertically-integrated nature of our operations, including the aluminum extrusion products provided by TG, there is a more limited set of competitors and entry into these markets. In addition, the equipment needed to operate in the glass and window industry is expensive, requiring a significant upfront capital investment. In addition, our ES Windows University provides training to our employees ensuring a dedicated and loyal work force, giving us an advantage that potential competitors lack, as they may not be able to bear the cost of providing similar training or retaining similarly trained employees.
Innovation
 
We have made significant investments in machinery and equipment in order to deploy the latest technology in our production lines. We have state-of-the-art glass making equipment, glass laminating lines and high-volume insulating equipment, which allow for a more precise and high quality manufacturing less raw material waste and the chance of developing new products. Being able to employ state-of-the-art technology is a competitive differentiator that (i) allows us to produce higher-quality products creating a competitive pricing advantage that can translate into higher margins, (ii) allows for less material waste and a more energy efficient process, and (iii) enables the manufacturing of a broader array of products.

● | During the last two years, we acquired three aluminum extrusion presses that together added more than 1,000 tons of production capacity per month, along with related aluminum paint line and a new foundry, which investments totaled $80.2 million in 2015 and $42.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In August 2014, we entered into a contract to purchase equipment to produce soft coated low emissivity glass as part of our improvement plan, which started production in the last quarter of 2015 and was in production throughout 2016. 
● | We purchased two glass-laminating and tempering furnaces that use state-of the-art technologies to produce tempered glass with no distortion using air cushion technology (TecnoAir) and to produce curved glass in a broad range of easily modifiable curvatures (TecnoBend). TecnoAir technology glass sheets “float” on air pressing systems rather than running on metallic rolls. TecnoBend has a flexible mold that permits different curved shapes to be employed in architectural structures. 
● | For certain of our products, we offer DuPont Sentryglass®, laminated glass interlayers recognized as industry-leading laminated glass solutions with five times the resistance strength of competing materials. 
● | We also use a laminator and jumbo tempering oven capable of producing extra-large slabs of laminated glass, which are sought after in the high-end window market. For example, our extra-large glass slabs have been recently used in El Dorado Airport (Bogotá). 

 
These investments in machinery and equipment, together with our highly trained labor force, allow us to offer state-of-the-art custom designed products that are tailored to meet customer demands.
 
Competitive cost structure
 
We provide high quality products to our customers at competitive prices primarily as a result of the efficiencies we achieve through vertical integration and comparatively low labor costs. Our ES Windows University provides training to our employees ensuring a dedicated and loyal work force that works efficiently and also is less susceptible to workplace injuries. These competitive advantages give us greater flexibility in pricing without adversely affecting our profit margins and allow our products to be competitive in a variety of markets.
 
Superior Customer Service
 
In addition to manufacturing high quality products, our value proposition to our customers is based on industry-leading lead times, on-time delivery and superior after-sale support. Through the coordinated efforts of our sales teams, product specialists, and field service teams, we deliver high quality service to our customers, from the time the initial order is placed through the delivery and installation of our products. By providing an efficient flow of product from order through delivery, our manufacturing processes allow us to deliver made-to-order products consistently on time, which we believe is an important competitive strength.

Management Experience
 
José Daes, our chief executive officer, and Christian Daes, our chief operating officer, have more than 30 years of industry experience, respectively. In addition, our executive management teams have worked together for many years at our operating subsidiaries. This long tenure in the industry, and as a team, has enabled our management to build significant relationships with both clients and field level management. We believe that these relationships, coupled with management’s strong technical expertise, create a significant competitive advantage.
 
Strong relationship with local communities
 
For several decades, we have had committed resources to improving the quality of life of our employees and the local communities surrounding our plants. As a result of these initiatives, we have developed close and cooperative relationships with local communities in Colombia, which are supported by several social responsibility initiatives we have undertaken. We view our employees as key to our historical and future success and therefore have focused initiatives of our non-for-profit, Fundación Tecnoglass, on offering our employees and their families the resources to purchase or improve their homes through the Programa de Mejora de Vivienda. Additionally, our foundation offers educational stipends for higher education pursuits. During 2016, 60 families were benefited from our Programa de Mejora de Vivienda, and currently we are sponsoring 128 employees and their children through our scholarship program, Programa de Becas. Fundación Tecnoglass also supports a school for primary and secondary education in the La Paz neighborhood in Barranquilla, Colombia, and, in collaboration with Fundación Pacific Rubiales, Fundación Colombia Somos Todos and soccer star James Rodriguez, we support children in vulnerable neighborhoods to thrive through sports, with around 400 children participating to date, among several other social welfare programs designed to lend support to the most vulnerable citizens in Barranquilla and its surrounding communities. All of these initiatives have allowed us to maintain an excellent relationship with our employees, in which we have been able to maintain a labor union free environment since our incorporation.
 
Strategy
 
We have identified the following items that we believe are important in advancing our business:
 
Development of additional high-value products supported by continued investments in equipment and state-of-the-art technology.
 
We have a track record of developing new products and will continue to focus on capitalizing on new product opportunities in the future. We constantly identify shifting global trends and growing marketplace needs, and design proposals to meet those needs. For instance, with the installation of our new soft coating facility, we are now able to manufacture low emissivity glass that is energy efficient and will allow us to service a growing market that demands “green” initiatives. We will seek to leverage our existing platform of cutting-edge production facilities to adapt our products to evolving demands for structural architectural glass in our current markets and evaluate opportunities to enter new markets. We expect our reputation and proven track-record of innovation will position us well to take advantage of these opportunities.
 
We made investments of an aggregate of $136.8 million from 2014 to 2015, and $42.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, including:
 

● | state-of-the-art glass-making equipment; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the installation of new laminating lines; 
● | high-volume insulating equipment; 
● | a new aluminum extrusion press with the capacity for an additional one thousand tons per month; 
● | a new paint line with the capacity to treat one million pounds of aluminum per month; and 
● | a new aluminum foundry. 

 
Additionally, we are in the process of implementing new technologies to produce tempered glass that offers notably more transparency with significantly less distortion than industry standard using air cushion technology, as well as new technology used to produce curved glass in a broad range of easily modifiable curvatures. Additionally, in 2014 we started producing architectural systems that integrate LED lighting allowing the façade of the building to display different colors and patterns. We further intend to explore expanding our operation to provide value-added glass products such as our soft-coated low-emissivity window panes that minimize the effect of solar heat.
 
We believe these innovative products will provide us with a competitive edge. The continued development of new products with the corresponding investments in technology, allows us to support our track-record of innovation and allow for continued customer demand by fulfilling ever-changing needs.

Manufacture the highest quality products in the market through a rigorous quality assurance program
 
Our plants are organized internally by processes, each of which is independently and continually supervised by the Quality Assurance department. The Quality Assurance department maintains rigorous oversight over energy, water, recyclable waste and process optimization indicators, in order to produce high quality sustainable products. Our quality assurance control system has established the measures and indicators necessary for the inspections implemented over the reception of materials, production process and final products. Additionally, between 5% and 10% of our production, randomly chosen, is sent to our laboratories to verify compliance with a variety of quality standards, such as water leaks, functionality, manufacturing and accessories, through tests undertaken according to ASTM and AAMA rules. We have implemented these measures in order to reach an effective control in detecting potential issues and to take the specific actions to mitigate their occurrence. By providing the highest quality products and ensuring they meet the highest standards of quality, we seek to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.
 
Continued vertical integration provides margin enhancement
 
We benefit from having our key operating companies and processes operating together at a combined facility, providing advantages in meeting customer and market needs, controlling supply chain issues and managing operating costs. By continuing to operate as a vertically integrated company, we seek to further enhance productivity, create cost efficiencies and increase operating margins. In recent developments, we strive to further vertically integrate the operations of the Company through the acquisition of ESW LLC, an importer and distributor of Company products in the U.S in December 2016. Furthermore, on March 1, 2017, the Company acquired GM&P, a South Florida glazing contracting company to incorporate the design and installation of various building enclosure systems such as curtain window walls and a long-standing commercial relationship with the Company, working alongside it in different projects within the U.S, by providing engineering and installation services to those projects.
 
Leverage strength in Florida market to further penetrate U.S.
 
We believe we have an established and leading presence in the Florida construction market as providers of high value, impact-resistant glass products. ES’s hurricane-proof products are certified in compliance with the stringent requirements of hurricane-proof windows in accordance with applicable U.S. regulations. With a quality of product proven by our success and compliance in the impact-resistant market, we have successfully entered the U.S. remodeling and replacement parts market. In addition, we have grown geographically in the U.S., particularly into other coastal markets on the East Coast which are affected by hurricanes, significant temperature fluctuations and other extreme weather. As we continue to explore opportunities in other markets in the U.S., we intend to leverage the strong reputation we have developed in markets such as Florida to take advantage of a resurgent commercial and residential real estate sector.
 
Continue to leverage strength in Colombia market to further penetrate Latin America
 
With a strong base in Colombia, we have already successfully expanded into nearby geographies. Our glass products are featured in major construction projects in Argentina, Aruba, Costa Rica, Panama and Puerto Rico. As the construction market throughout Latin America grows, we are positioned to capture new growth in the markets we have currently penetrated, as well as in new high growth countries. We will also take advantage of our geographical location to deliver products to South American markets at relatively low shipping and operating cost.
 
Maintain fast and reliable delivery to customers due to strategic location
 
From the Port of Barranquilla, products can be transported to Panama by air in one hour and to Houston and Miami within two hours, within two days by sea to Panama and within four days by sea to Houston and Miami. Our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis complements the relatively low cost of shipping our products from Barranquilla to Florida and supports the value of our strategic location. As a result of this strategic location, we are able to meet the requirements of architectures and developers who seek to obtain building products on a schedule that does not interfere with their construction progress. As we target different projects and markets, we will seek to take advantage of our unique delivery capabilities to satisfy demands of the construction industry.

Brands and Trademarks
 
Our brands include Tecnoglass, ES Windows and Alutions. Our registered trademarks include “Alutions by Tecnoglass” with the accompanying logo and “Alutions”.
 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
 
Sales and marketing
 
Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining customers by consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product quality, and competitive pricing. Our customers also value our shorter lead times, knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise, which collectively generate significant customer loyalty. Our products are marketed using a combination of internal sales representatives, independent sales representatives and directly to distributors. Our internal sales representatives receive a portion of their performance-based compensation based on sales and profitability metrics. We primarily market our products based on product quality, outstanding service, shorter lead times and on-time delivery.
 
We employ a highly efficient number of in-house sales employees. Most of our sales and marketing efforts are handled by area sales representatives who work on a commission basis.
 
We do not rely on significant traditional advertising expenditures to drive net sales. We have established and maintain credibility primarily through the strength of our products, our customer service and quality assurance, the speed at which we deliver finished products and the attractiveness of our pricing. Our advertising expenditures consist primarily of maintaining our subsidiaries’ websites.

Customer Service
 
We believe that our ability to provide customers outstanding service quality serves as a strong competitive differentiator. Our customer relationships are established and maintained through the coordinated efforts of our sales and production teams. We employ a highly responsive and efficient team of professionals devoted to addressing customer support with the goal of resolving any issue in a timely manner. In order to promote customer loyalty and employee development, we developed ES Windows University with the primary objectives of training employees to be aware of client and supplier needs and familiarizing them with our strategic goals in order to improve the competitiveness, productivity and quality of all products offered.
Working Capital Requirements
 
Our principal use of cash is related to trade accounts receivable which amounted to $26.0 million and $29.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such use is directly correlated with the company´s ongoing growth and an industry related longer cash cycle. These receivables are often associated to sophisticated, long-lead projects that typically have longer collection periods as distributors also have to collect from end-users, and for that, certain performance conditions must always be met. Additionally, the Company´s strategy continues to include further geographical diversification into more distant markets within the United States, which also may contribute to longer collection cycles. Albeit these factors, the Company doesn’t foresee a deterioration in its ability to collect from its direct or indirect clients (as evidenced by its relatively stable days sales outstanding relation without accounting for foreign currency translation) and by its very low receivables write-off. The Company continues to focus on ways to improve collection times with some of its most representative clients.
 
Our inventory requirements are not as significant since our products are made-to-order rather than build-to-stock and as such, inventory levels follow customer orders. During 2016, the Company spent a fair amount of time and resources undertaking “lean manufacturing” best practices with and external consultant and as a result, it was able to better manage inventory levels and improve turnover during the year.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include architects, building owners, general contractors and glazing subcontractors in the commercial construction market. We have over 900 customers. Of our 100 most representative customers, which represent over 88% of our sales, about 52% are located in North America, 4% in Central America and the Caribbean, and 44% in South America. Only one customer, GM&P Consulting and Glazing, accounted for more than 10% or more of our net sales during 2016 and 2015 with 26% and 14% of sales during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On March 1, 2017 the Company entered into and consummated a purchase agreement with Giovanni Monti, the owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of GM&P. With the acquisition of GM&P, the Company has reduced its customer risk concentration and dependence on a single client.
Backlog
 
We had combined outstanding orders of $396 million as of December 31, 2016 as compared to $375 million as of December 31, 2015. We do not believe that backlog is indicative of our future results of operations or prospects. Although we seek commitments from customers well in advance of shipment dates, actual confirmed orders are typically not received until close to the required shipment dates.
Materials and Suppliers
 
Our primary manufacturing materials include glass, ionoplast, polyvinyl butyral, and aluminum and vinyl extrusions. Although in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by us or the supplier counterparties on limited notice. Typically, all of our materials are readily available from a number of sources, and no supplier delays or shortages are anticipated.
 
We source raw materials and glass necessary to manufacture our products from a variety of domestic and foreign suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, three suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of total raw material purchases, which in aggregate represent 38% of raw material purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of raw material purchases.
 
Warranties
 
We offer product warranties which we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product. Our standard warranties are generally from five to ten years for architectural glass, curtain wall, laminated and tempered glass, window and door products. Warranties are not priced or sold separately and do not provide the customer with services or coverages in addition to the assurance that the product complies with original agreed-upon specifications. In the event of a claim against a product for which we have received a warranty from the supplier, we transfer the claim back to the supplier. The Company evaluated historical information regarding claims for replacements under warranties and concluded that the costs that the Company has incurred in relation to these warranties have not been material.

Competitors
 
We have local competitors in Colombia as well as competitors in the international markets in each of the glass, aluminum and finished products sectors. Glass Tecnología en Vidrios y Ventanas S.A., Arquicentro S.A., Aluminum Estructural S.A. and Ventanar Ltda, compete with us in the finished products market in Colombia. Apogee Enterprises, Inc., PGT, Inc. and WinDoor Inc. compete with us in the U.S. finished products market. Golden Glass Security, Vid-plex Universal S.A., Aluace Ltda and Laminados y Blindados compete with us locally in the glass and aluminum markets. Oldcastle, Inc., Trulite Inc., and PRL Glass Systems are among others that compete with us in the U.S. glass and aluminum products markets.
 
The key factors on which we and our competitors compete for business include: quality, price and reputation, breadth of products and service offerings, and production speed. We face intense competition from both smaller and larger market players who compete against us in our various markets including glass, window and aluminum manufacturing.
 
The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door distributors and dealers, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality customized products on demand with short turnaround times while offering competitive pricing. The vertical integration of our operations, our geographic scope, low labor costs and economies of scale have helped our subsidiaries consolidate their leading position in Colombia and bolstered their expansion in the U.S. and other foreign markets.

Government Regulations
 
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety and fire codes. Additionally, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate require that installation of doors and windows be approved by competent authorities that grant distribution licenses. Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations.
 
Also, we are subject to a potential revision of the United States-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (“USCOFTA”), which allows Colombian entities to export to USA without any tariffs. Mr. Donald Trump, US President, has made public announcements about the intention to re-negotiate certain terms of free trade agreements, which could potentially implement a tariff. However, the Company can mitigate this risk by transferring the price to its consumers and diversifying its business operations.
 
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we spent approximately $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in research and development. The Company incurs in costs related to the development of new products and pays for external tests that need to be performed on our products in order to comply with strict building codes. The Company is fully permitted to commercialize hurricane windows in the Miami-Dade County, Florida, which has one of the most demanding certifications in the world of window frames.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 5,853 employees, with 3,373 employed by ES, 2,459 employed by Tecnoglass and 21 employed by ESW LLC, none of whom is represented by a union. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 5,399 employees, with 3,250 employed by ES, 2,149 employed by Tecnoglass and 20 employed by ESW LLC. Most of our employees are hired through seven temporary staffing companies and are employed under one-year fixed-term employment contracts. Management believes it has good relations with our employees. We provide ongoing training programs to our employees through the self-established E.S. Windows University.
Company History
 
We were formed under the name “Andina Acquisition Corporation” as an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on September 21, 2011 in order to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
 
In March, 2012, we closed our IPO of 4,200,000 units, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $8.00 per share, at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $42,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated a private placement of 4,800,000 warrants (“private warrants”) at a price of $0.50 per warrant and, to the underwriters, options to purchase an aggregate of 900,000 units at a price of $500,100, generating total proceeds of $2,900,100. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us were $43,163,000 of which $42,740,000 was deposited into a trust account. The remaining proceeds of $423,000 became available to be used as working capital to provide for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses. The IPO was conducted pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (Reg. No. 333-178061), that became effective on March 16, 2012.
 
From the consummation of our IPO until August 17, 2013, we were searching for a suitable target business to acquire. On August 17, 2013, we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization, pursuant to which agreement, as amended, we acquired Tecnoglass Holding, Tecnoglass and ES as direct and indirect subsidiaries. On December 20, 2013, we held an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, at which our shareholders approved the Merger and other related proposals. On the same date, we closed the Merger and Tecnoglass Holding and its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tecnoglass and ES, became our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 
Tecnoglass Holding is a corporation formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands that was founded in 2014 in connection with the Merger. Tecnoglass is a corporation formed under the laws of Colombia that was founded in 1994 by Jose M. Daes, our Chief Executive Officer, and Christian T. Daes, our Chief Operating Officer. ES is a corporation formed under the laws of Colombia that was founded in 1984 by Jose M. Daes and Christian T. Daes.
 
At the closing of the Business Combination, 2,251,853 of the 4,200,000 public shares sold in our IPO were converted to cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.18 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $22.9 million of the approximately $42.7 million held in the trust account. As consideration for the Business Combination, we issued Energy Holding Corp., a holding company and sole shareholder of Tecnoglass Holding, of which former shareholders of TG and ES were the sole shareholders, an aggregate of 20,567,141 ordinary shares, or approximately 87% of the outstanding ordinary shares. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization, we also issued to Energy Holding Corp. an additional 500,000 ordinary shares upon the achievement of the specified EBITDA targets in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, 1,000,000 ordinary shares upon achievement of the specified EBITDA target in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and 1,500,000 ordinary shares upon the achievement of the specified EBITDA target in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

In connection with the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Tecnoglass Inc.” We also changed our fiscal year end from February 28 to December 31 in order to coincide with the fiscal year end of Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries.
 
In 2014, we established two entities in South Florida, Tecno LLC and Tecno RE, to acquire manufacturing and sales-related assets to support sales and customer service in the United States.
 
In September 2016, we completed a warrant exchange whereby each warrant holder was given the opportunity to exchange 2.5 outstanding warrants for one ordinary share. As a result of the warrant exchange, 5,479,049 warrants, or 82% of the outstanding warrants were validly tendered. As of September 30, 2016, 1,275,823 warrants remained outstanding following completion of the warrant exchange referenced above. Of these, 1,265,842 warrants were exercised prior to the December 20, 2016 expiration, resulting in the issuance of 478,218 Tecnoglass common shares. The remaining unexercised warrants expired by their own terms on December 20, 2016.
 
As part of our strategy to vertically integrate our operations, on December 2, 2016 we acquired 100% of the equity of ESW LLC, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million. The acquisition was recorded retroactively starting from the first date of common control. Instead of using fair value, the Company consolidates the financial statements of the entity acquired using the existing carrying values.
 
As a subsequent event, on March 1, 2017 the Company entered into and consummated a purchase agreement with Giovanni Monti, the owner of 100% of the outstanding shares of GM&P. The Company acquired all of the shares of GM&P for a purchase price of $35 million, of which the Company will pay $6 million of the purchase price in cash within the 60 days following the closing date and the remaining $29 million of the purchase price to be payable on or before September 1, 2017 in cash, our ordinary shares or a combination of both, at our sole option.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (or JOBS Act), and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. However, we have irrevocably opted not to take advantage of one such exemption which would have allowed us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are, and will continue to be, subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following March 22, 2017 (the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering). However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year.
