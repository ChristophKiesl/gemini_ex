Item 1. Business
Overview
Sovos Brands is a growth-oriented consumer-packaged food company with a portfolio of brands aimed at bringing today’s consumers great tasting food that fits the way they live. 
In 2017, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Todd R. Lachman, together with our Chairman, William R. Johnson, identified an opportunity within the broader food landscape to acquire and build a portfolio of disruptive growth brands whose high-quality products support premium positioning. With the backing of the globally established private equity firm, Advent International, Sovos Brands was formed and has become a leading and differentiated premium player within the packaged food industry.
Since our inception, we have been focused on building an organization with the capabilities to acquire and grow brands as we continue to scale. Our leadership team has extensive experience managing portfolios of global brands at some of the most respected consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) companies. To unlock our full potential, we combined a distinctive mix of industry veterans, entrepreneurs and food lovers and built an inclusive culture where everyone has a voice. As a result, we believe we have been able to attract leading talent from across the CPG landscape.

In September 2021, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and became actively traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) listed under the trade symbol of “SOVO.”
On December 30, 2022, we completed the divestiture of the Birch Benders brand and certain related assets to Hometown Food Company, a portfolio company controlled by Brynwood Partners VIII L.P.
Our current brands, Rao’s, Michael Angelo’s and noosa, are built with authenticity at their core, providing consumers food experiences that are genuine, delicious and unforgettable. Our products are premium and made with simple, high-quality ingredients. 
Our business model centers around our premium, taste-led, high-quality brands and leveraging a common infrastructure and shared playbook to drive growth. Our brands share multiple attributes, including: being delicious, possessing a leading consumer affinity, acting as potential category disruptors in large categories and utilizing brand strength to extend into new categories. Our brands generally over-index with young and family-oriented consumers who have higher disposable incomes. Our consumers are passionate about taste and high-quality ingredients according to Company-sponsored third-party studies and have higher basket sizes at retail compared to the category averages. We believe we are a strategic and valuable partner to retailers as our brands generally drive incremental sales in our categories, offer better unit economics than key competitors and attract a highly coveted consumer base willing to spend more per trip than category averages, according to IRI, the leading provider of industry data and consumer insights. Our brands share a common playbook for growth, which is focused on increasing household penetration by:

1. | Increasing distribution;
---+-------------------------


2. | Expanding brand awareness;
---+---------------------------


3. | Improving sales and marketing execution; and
---+---------------------------------------------


4. | Innovating into new categories.
---+--------------------------------

Our platform was designed to provide a foundation for future growth and to capture synergies as we scale. We regularly monitor and evaluate potential acquisition opportunities with a focus on brands that have our targeted attributes, significant growth potential, and the opportunity to combine our industry expertise with fresh thinking to bring these brands into more homes.
Our portfolio is diversified across brands and categories, with exposure to all meal occasions, especially breakfast and dinner where we believe consumers have the highest propensity to purchase food for their homes.
Our principal executive offices are located at 168 Centennial Parkway, Suite 200, Louisville, Colorado, 80027. Our telephone number is (720) 316-1225. We maintain a web site at www.sovosbrands.com.
Our Brands and Products 
Our portfolio currently consists of three brands: Rao’s, Michael Angelo’s and noosa. We previously owned the Birch Benders brand, which was sold at the end of fiscal 2022. Our brands offer premium, on-trend and high-quality products in a variety of product categories and appeal to consumers for consumption in a broad range of occasions, including breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner. We completed the acquisitions of Bottom Line Food Processors, Inc. d/b/a Michael Angelo’s Gourmet Foods and Rao’s Specialty Foods (“Rao’s” or “RSF”) in January 2017 and July 2017, respectively, and our single sales and supply chain organization supported the rapid functional integration of the Michael Angelo’s and Rao’s brands. We completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Noosa Holdings, Inc. (the “Noosa Acquisition”) in November 2018, and in October 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Birch Benders business (the “Birch Benders Acquisition”). Rao’s net sales have grown at a five year compounded annual growth rate of 52% since 2017. With noosa,

we leveraged synergies to gain greater scale, and noosa net sales have grown at a three year compounded annual growth rate of 5% since 2019. 
Rao’s
The iconic Rao’s brand was established as a consumer-packaged food brand in 1991 with a storied New York City heritage. The Rao’s brand offers a selection of Rao’s Homemade pasta sauces (including tomato-based sauces, Alfredo sauces and Pesto sauces), pizza sauces and dry pastas; Rao’s Homestyle meat-based pasta sauces; and Rao’s Made for Home frozen entrées, frozen pizza and soups. Rao’s sauces are simmered slowly and made in small batches with only high-quality ingredients, like pure olive oil and hand-selected, naturally ripened tomatoes from southern Italy. Our sauces have no tomato blends, no paste, no water, no fillers and no added sugar. Rao’s was the fastest-growing center store brand of scale from 2018 through 2020. The household penetration of Rao’s sauce products has increased from 1.3% in the 52 weeks ended January 3, 2016 to 11.9% in the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2022.
Michael Angelo’s
Michael Angelo’s was founded in 1983 with original Italian recipes that had been passed down for generations. Michael Angelo’s frozen products include a variety of signature dishes, such as eggplant parmesan, lasagna made with fresh Ricotta cheese, shrimp scampi and other pastas, for a homemade taste. We believe that our Michael Angelo’s brand is a leading producer of premium frozen entrées inspired by Italian traditions. The household penetration of Michael Angelo’s frozen dinners was 4.7% in the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2022. In fiscal 2023, Michael Angelo’s launched into the pasta sauce category.
noosa
An Australian expatriate co-founded Noosa Yoghurt in 2008 with a fourth-generation Colorado dairy farmer. In 2010, Noosa Yoghurt began selling yogurt at Colorado farmers markets and local Whole Foods stores. Our noosa brand offers a suite of delicious yogurt products, including spoonable yogurts and drinkable smoothies. noosa products are creamy and delicious and made with high-quality ingredients, such as whole milk from cows never treated with the growth hormone rBGH, real fruit and wildflower honey. The household penetration of noosa yogurts was 7.5% in the 52 weeks ended December 25, 2022. In fiscal 2022, noosa launched into the ice cream category with noosa frozen yogurt gelato.
Birch Benders
In October 2020, we completed the purchase of 100% ownership interest in Birch Benders. At the end of fiscal 2022, we completed the divestiture of the Birch Benders brand and certain related assets.
Our Customers
We sell our products to customers primarily in the United States and principally to retail outlets and wholesale distributors, including traditional supermarkets, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, specialty food distributors, military commissaries and non-food outlets, such as drug store chains, dollar stores and e-commerce retailers. In fiscal 2022, approximately 1% of our gross sales were to international customers. We believe that the strength of our brands and our premium, on-trend and high-quality product portfolio make us a strategic partner for our customers and that we have opportunities for international growth. We utilize our direct sales force and brokers as well as third-party distributors, some of whom also purchase our products directly for their own accounts for resale, for the sale and distribution of our products.

​
​



In fiscal 2022, our largest customers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”), Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”), accounted for approximately 17%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of our gross sales, and our top five largest customers together accounted for approximately 53% of our gross sales. 
Marketing, Advertising and Consumer Research
We utilize a variety of marketing channels to drive household penetration and brand awareness through paid, earned and owned marketing channels. We focus our marketing efforts on building an authentic connection with our consumers. We primarily use digital marketing and dedicate the majority of our marketing expenditures to paid advertising on digital marketing channels through videos, e-commerce advertisements, paid search, paid social advertisements and branded content. We also engage with consumers through social media “influencers,” public relations outreach to editors, and incentives such as coupons or other advertising placed on or near our products in stores.
Digital Advertising
Our digital marketing efforts include video advertisements that play as viewers stream content like television shows on online video channels and applications, content and paid social advertisements for social media networks, paid advertisements and paid preferable placement of our products on e-commerce sites, paid advertisements for our brands and products in search results, online and mobile coupons and promotions and paid advertisements on third-party and retailer mobile sites, third-party and retailer websites and in-store near our products or at check-outs to drive purchases of our products. In addition, we maintain an active email program, which we leverage to deliver information on new product launches and promotions for our Rao’s and noosa brands, and we maintain registered domains at www.sovosbrands.com, www.raos.com, www.noosayoghurt.com and www.michaelangelos.com, which serve to communicate news about our brands directly to consumers who access our websites and social media sites and to address questions, comments or concerns about our products. From January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the websites for our Rao’s and noosa brands collectively had an average of approximately 228,000 visitors per month according to Google Analytics.
Social Media, Influencers, Earned Media and Branded Content
We have an active presence on social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, to connect with our consumers for each of our brands. For example, we showcase our products and feature recipes on our brands’ Instagram accounts. We also partner with a number of social media “influencers” who generate further awareness of our brands through sponsored content, such as custom posts and “micro-sweeps” or giveaway offerings, on various social media platforms. We focus on selecting social media “influencers” who are real-life, approachable fans with whom our consumers can relate as well as chefs and experts on food or dietary lifestyles. In fiscal 2022, we estimate that our influencers and social channels delivered 13.3 million impressions for our current brands. In addition, we utilize public relations outreach to editors and journalists, partner with companies to create branded content featuring our brand names or products and collaborate from time to time with celebrities or chefs to promote and endorse our products. Our paid marketing efforts are supplemented by earned media when editors, journalists, celebrities and consumers feature our brands and products in their articles, recipes, and posts as well as by word-of-mouth recommendations of our products. In fiscal 2022, we estimate that earned media efforts generated approximately 11.1 billion impressions for our current brands.
Raw Materials, Ingredients and Packaging
We purchase raw materials, including agricultural products, whole milk, animal proteins, tomatoes, cheese, fruit and other ingredients from growers, commodity processors, ingredient suppliers and other food companies located primarily in North America. We also purchase packaging materials, including tubs, caps and lids, trays, labels, corrugated cardboard, cartons and other packaging, from packaging manufacturers located primarily in North America. The principal raw materials we purchase for our products include whole milk, fruit, tubs and lids, cheese, tomatoes, animal proteins, trays and folding cartons. The co-packers we use for production of our Rao’s, Michael Angelo’s and noosa independently

schedule and purchase the raw materials, ingredients and packaging they use in manufacturing our products, although we may provide some packaging (such as labels) for our Rao’s co-packers. We purchase the majority of our packaging materials under contracts that include escalator and de-escalator formulas for the purchase of the raw materials used in our packaging, which include resin, paperboard and aluminum. 
The profitability of our business relies in substantial part on the prices we and our co-packers pay for these and other raw materials, ingredients and packaging materials, which can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including changes in weather, crop size, cattle cycles, crop disease and crop pests, commodity market fluctuations, such as those caused by supply and demand, costs of carrying stock and inventory and government subsidies, natural disasters and crude oil prices. In addition, certain materials required for the manufacture of our products, such as glass and aluminum, have been or may be impacted by tariffs. The availability and cost of certain raw materials, including resin, aluminum, glass, animal protein, agricultural products and other commodities, have increased resulting in supply constraints to meet demand due to reduced production shifts and labor shortages, among other factors, and have also been adversely impacted by ongoing global geopolitical tensions, including relating to Ukraine.
Fluctuations in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intensive price competition, as well as influence consumer and trade buying patterns. We attempt to manage some of the risks of increased costs of raw materials, ingredients, packaging and other costs related to the production of our products by entering into supply contracts that offer price and supply certainty and implementing cost-saving programs.
Production and Manufacturing
Manufacturing
We operate two manufacturing facilities for our products. We produce our Rao’s Made for Home and Michael Angelo’s frozen products in Austin, Texas and we produce all noosa spoonable yogurts in Bellvue, Colorado. See Item 2. “Properties.”
Co-Packing Arrangements
In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a significant portion of our products under “co-packing” arrangements, a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies. Co-packing arrangements generally offer flexibility and improved speed to market by leveraging equipment and technology already in place. Our co-packer La Regina di San Marzano USA, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, “La Regina”) currently produces the substantial majority of our Rao’s Homemade tomato-based sauce products in Italy and has established a manufacturing facility in Alma, Georgia that uses imported ingredients for the production of our tomato-based sauces. We have entered into an agreement that provides La Regina the exclusive rights to be the third-party supplier of certain of our tomato-based sauce products in the United States. We have the right to purchase the La Regina U.S. facility under certain circumstances. Our U.S. agreement with La Regina has a base term ending December 31, 2031, with five-year extensions (unless three years’ notice of non-renewal is provided), and limits La Regina’s ability to produce products for other brands. Our Italy agreement with La Regina has a base term ending December 31, 2027, with a seven-year extension (unless three years’ notice of non-renewal is provided), and limits La Regina’s ability to produce products for other brands. We also use co-packers located in the United States and Italy to supplement our supply of Rao’s Homemade tomato-based sauce products and for the production of our Rao’s Homestyle tomato-based sauces with meat as well as our Rao’s Homemade Alfredo sauces and Pesto sauces. We use co-packers located in the United States and Canada for our Rao’s Made for Home soups. For our Rao’s Homemade dry pastas, we use a co-packer in Italy. The remainder of our noosa products, including fruit smoothies and gelato, are each produced by different co-packers located in the United States. We may leverage a co-packer located in the United States from time to time to supplement our in-house production of select Michael Angelo’s products.

​
​



All of the companies with which we have co-packing arrangements produce products for other companies as well as for us, except for La Regina, which produces sauce products exclusively for us and their own branded products. Most of our co-packers may periodically pass production cost adjustments as well as ingredients and packaging adjustments based on market pricing on to us. We believe that there are alternative sources of co-packing production available for the majority of our products, although we may experience disturbances in our operations and delays in delivery or production or higher costs if we are required to change our co-packing arrangements unexpectedly. We monitor capacity and performance of our co-packers and seek to qualify alternate suppliers as needed.
Distribution and Logistics
We distribute our products to our customers’ distribution centers directly from our production facilities, our co-packers’ production facilities or from warehouses operated by third-party logistics (“3PL”) providers. Certain of our customers are also distributors. With respect to the noosa spoonable yogurts that we produce at our Bellvue, Colorado production facility, we distributed approximately 65% by weight directly to our customers in fiscal 2022. With respect to the Rao’s Made for Home and Michael Angelo’s frozen products that we produce at our Austin, Texas production facility, we distributed approximately 25% by weight directly to our customers in fiscal 2022. The remainder of the products we produce in Bellvue, Colorado and Austin, Texas, as well as our noosa drinkable smoothies and certain Rao’s and Michael Angelo’s products are distributed through 3PL warehouses. In addition, some of our customers, including some that are distributors, pick up certain of our products from our 3PL providers’ warehouses or from our co-packers’ production facilities. Customers, including those that are distributors, picked up approximately 85% of our Rao’s shelf-stable products in fiscal 2022. To the extent we do not deliver products directly to customers or customers do not pick up our products, our products are delivered from 3PL warehouses to our customers via common carrier.
Due in part to the different demands of distribution for frozen, refrigerated and shelf-stable products, each of our brands currently utilizes a different 3PL network. We partner with two 3PL providers located in Southern California and one 3PL provider in New Jersey for distribution of our Rao’s products, one 3PL provider located in Fort Morgan, Colorado for distribution of our noosa products and one 3PL provider located in Dallas, Texas for distribution of our Rao’s Made for Home and Michael Angelo’s products. We have warehouse agreements with our 3PL providers that we believe provide us with adequate flexibility and capacity to accommodate incremental product volume.
We also sell and distribute Rao’s shelf-stable products directly to consumers through our website and Amazon.
Research and Development
Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy, which includes extending our product offerings into other categories. A team of food and culinary scientists, food engineers and microbiologists work to develop products to meet identified opportunities. In addition to developing new products, our research and development team regularly reformulates existing products based on advances in ingredients, equipment, materials and technology as well as to facilitate cost reduction initiatives, improve our products and support ownership of recipes. In addition to our Company-sponsored research and development activities, in order to quickly and economically introduce our new products to market or supplement our internal expertise, we may partner with contract manufacturers that make our products according to our formulas or other specifications. We also supplement our internal expertise from time to time with innovation consultants and our ingredient and material suppliers. Our research and development team also provides technical services, providing input on production line design, initial production runs on new equipment and start-up runs for new products at our facilities and some of our co-packers. We completed the improvements to our research and development facility in Austin, Texas in the third quarter of 2022, investing a total of approximately $1.2 million of capital, and we expect that we will continue to build our research and development capabilities in order to support our current brands, any future acquired brands and entrance into new categories.

Intellectual Property
We believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer’s decision to purchase one product over another in the highly competitive consumer products industry. We believe the protection and enforcement of our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other proprietary rights are important to our success. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade dress, domain names, confidentiality procedures, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other intellectual property laws and contractual rights.
We own or have the rights to use a number of trademarks, brand names and other proprietary rights that are important to our business and consumer awareness of our brands. We own registered trademarks for our principal product brand names in the United States, including “Rao’s,” “Rao’s Homemade,” “Rao’s Homemade Since 1896,” “noosa,” “noosa finest yoghurt” and “Michael Angelo’s,” and various logos used in association with these terms. We have also applied for or obtained trademark registrations for many of our principal product brand names internationally, including in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and select countries in Asia. We own domain names which correspond to our primary brand names, including www.raos.com, www.noosayoghurt.com and www.michaelangelos.com. In addition, we rely on copyrights and proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, as well as continuing innovation, to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our subsidiary, RSF, is party to a worldwide co-existence agreement (the “Co-Existence Agreement”) with an unaffiliated third party, Rao’s Bar & Grill, Inc. (“RBG”), that governs each party’s rights to use and register trademarks consisting of or compromising Rao’s and associated logos (collectively, the “Rao’s Marks”). Pursuant to the Co-Existence Agreement, RSF owns the right to use and register the Rao’s Marks in connection with foods, food products, beverages, sauces and related goods and services (including, without limitation, cookbooks and online and retail store services), while RBG owns the right to use and register the Rao’s Marks in connection with restaurant and bar services, including the Rao’s restaurant in New York City which is not affiliated with us. RSF and RBG have agreed to reimburse one another for reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with actions relating to any unauthorized or improper use of a Rao’s Mark. Further, each of RSF and RBG’s obligations under the Co-Existence Agreement last until the other party abandons all rights in each of its Rao’s Marks, and the Co-Existence Agreement may not otherwise be terminated by RSF or RBG.
In March 2018, Noosa Yoghurt acquired from Queensland Yoghurt International Pty Ltd. (“Queensland”) the intellectual property rights for the “Added Fat Vat Set” yoghurt formula and process, together with all improvements (the “IP”), which Queensland had previously licensed to Noosa Yoghurt on an exclusive basis in the United States, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Islands. As a result of this purchase, Noosa Yoghurt has worldwide ownership of the IP for “Added Fat Vat Set” yoghurt (i.e., yoghurt product that has a milk fat content of 4.5% or more manufactured using a vat set fermentation process), subject to (i) certain pre-existing rights with respect to such IP granted to (a) a Queensland affiliate for exclusive use in Australia and (b) Hauraki Dairy Limited for exclusive use in Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and certain Pacific Islands and (ii) a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully-paid license to Queensland to use the IP to manufacture and sell products other than “Added Fat Vat Set” yoghurt (e.g., frozen yoghurt, low-fat yoghurt or other dairy products).
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
Food safety and product quality are essential to the successful distribution of our products. Food safety and product quality begin in the design phase of new products and continue as we establish the supply chain and commercialization of the products. We employ FDA Compliant Food Safety Plans or USDA Compliant Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) for our products at each of our manufacturing facilities. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We use a combination of internal and external quality control laboratories to test certain raw ingredients and materials for qualities, such as the presence of antibiotics in milk and packaging structures, and test finished products for microbiological, nutrient and analytical 

10
​
​



composition, and packaging performance such as pH value, viscosity and seal integrity. We also conduct on-site assessments of our co-packers to address topics, such as food safety plans, allergen control, ingredients, packaging and product specifications and sanitation.
In addition, both of our facilities have achieved a Safe Quality Food, or SQF, certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”). GFSI standards are integrated food safety and quality management protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality. Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with applicable regulations and standards.
Competition
The packaged food industry is highly competitive. We compete with large multi-brand consumer packaged food companies, smaller product-focused companies, emerging companies and dairy products- and dairy alternative-focused companies. Numerous brands and products, including private label products and insurgent brands, compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily on product quality and taste, convenience, price, trade promotion, brand recognition and loyalty, customer service, effective consumer advertising and promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences.
Competing large, multi-brand consumer packaged food companies include B&G Foods, Inc., Barilla Holding S.p.A., Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., General Mills, Inc., The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., the J.M. Smucker Company, the Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Mizkan Holdings, Nestle S.A. and PepsiCo, Inc. These competitors are large, multinational corporations with substantial financial, marketing, research and development and other resources. Smaller product-focused companies that we compete with include Amy’s Kitchen, G.L. Mezzetta, Inc. and Newman’s Own, Inc. Smaller and more product-focused competitors may be more innovative and able to bring new products to market faster and more quickly exploit and serve niche markets or new or burgeoning consumer preferences, and smaller insurgent brands may develop a customer base and consumer loyalty quickly. In addition, we compete against companies focused on dairy and dairy-alternative products, such as Chobani, LLC, Danone S.A., Fage International S.A. and The Lactalis Group.
Given limited retailer shelf space, competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing, advertising and promotional spending. In addition, most retailers offer private label products that also compete for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. We believe that consumers are increasingly willing to pay a premium for quality, great-tasting products and that we are well-positioned to compete with a wide range of packaged food brands and other companies.
Seasonality
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Consumer purchasing patterns are impacted by seasonal factors, including weather and holidays. Seasonality could cause our results of operations for an interim financial period to fluctuate and not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative net sales and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis.
Environmental, Social and Governance 
We recognize the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") issues for all of our stakeholders and we are working towards incorporating ESG principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. As a newly public company, we are in the early stages of building our ESG strategy and are using leading ESG and sustainability frameworks and guiding principles, such as the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, as well as stakeholder engagement to inform our ESG program. 

11
​
​



In 2022, we formed an ESG Steering committee comprised of senior leaders within our organization, which provides guidance on goals and strategies. To ensure that ESG is prioritized throughout our business, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our strategy, initiatives, policies, practices and reporting relating to ESG matters. 
In 2022, we conducted an ESG materiality report and internal assessment to identify the ESG issues that are most impactful to our business and most important to our stakeholders. The process is helping us to identify key risks and opportunities while maintaining our stakeholder-driven approach. The identification of these risks and opportunities will help to guide our approach to aligning our business and our ESG priorities.
In fiscal year 2023, we plan to release a summary of our preliminary ESG efforts aligned to industry-recognized ESG standards including the key risks and opportunities for us that we identified in our assessment. 
Human Capital, Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2022, we had 690 full-time employees, with 264 salaried employees and 426 hourly employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 
Our Culture, Vision, Mission and Values
At Sovos we are dedicated to bringing today’s consumers simple, great-tasting food that fits the way they live.
We have established six guiding principles to be the pillars at the core of how we work, including Lead with Courage and Tenacity, Focus on Quality, Obsess with the Front Line, Communicate with Candor and Respect, Be Nimble, and Enjoy the Ride. 
These guiding principles were identified specifically to separate us from the pack, inspire excellence and remind us to have some fun along the way. We value our employees and believe that employee loyalty and engagement are key elements of our operating performance.
We monitor our progress toward achieving our human capital resources objectives by regularly measuring human capital metrics, such as turn-over and retention of our employees.
Training and Development
We are focused on building a training and development program that will enable employees to further develop their success and careers at Sovos. 
Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 41% of our employees identified as women and approximately 52% of our employees identified as racially diverse.
Further, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 33% of the members of our board of directors (the “Board”) identified as women, and approximately 22% identified as racially diverse.
To improve diversity, equity and inclusion, we interview qualified diverse candidates for open corporate leadership positions and require every employee to attend training on preventing discrimination and harassment. 
Total Rewards

12
​
​



Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purpose of our cash incentive plan is to attract, retain and reward personnel across our company through the granting of cash-based compensation awards, which are intended to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. Our equity-based incentive plan has a similar purpose, and equity awards have historically been given to executives, senior management and directors. 
Benefits
Our employee benefits vary by region and generally include:
•medical, dental and vision benefits;
•401(k) with Company match;
•commuter benefits;
•wellness initiatives;
•flex time off; 
•tuition reimbursement; and
•paid parental leave, including for births, adoptions or placements of foster children.
Employee Safety and Wellbeing
Employee safety at our two manufacturing facilities is a top priority. We develop and administer policies designed to ensure the safety of our manufacturing personnel and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards. This includes regular safety training and assessments, annual safety audits and regularly informing our executives and Board of OSHA-reportable incidents.
Segments
Our operations are organized into two operating segments, (1) Dinner and Sauces and (2) Breakfast and Snacks. Our Dinner and Sauces operating segment includes Rao’s and Michael Angelo’s and our Breakfast and Snacks operating segment includes noosa and, through the end of fiscal 2022, Birch Benders. Due to similar economic characteristics between the two operating segments, Dinner and Sauces and Breakfast and Snacks are aggregated into one reporting segment. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products, (b) the nature of the production processes, (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers, (d) the type of customer for the products and (e) the nature of the regulatory environment.
Regulation and Compliance
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the USDA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities where our products are sold. We are also subject to laws regulating labor and employment; advertising and privacy; health and safety; and laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws, such as the FCPA.
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA for seafood products, as well as the Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the USDA for meat and poultry products. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. Both the FDA and the USDA 

13
​
​



regulate manufacturing practices for foods through food safety regulations, specify the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribe the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. Our manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas is subject to regular inspection by the USDA, and our products containing meat and poultry are subject to USDA regulation. The USDA has jurisdiction over our Rao’s Homemade, Rao’s Made for Home, Rao’s Homestyle and Michael Angelo’s sauces, soups and frozen entrées containing at least 3% raw or 2% cooked meat or poultry, and our and our U.S. co-packers’ facilities producing these products are subject to inspection by the USDA, with an inspector regularly present in our establishment when it is producing meat or poultry products. The FDA has jurisdiction over all of our other products with less than 3% raw or 2% cooked meat or poultry content and conducts inspections on a more intermittent basis.
We are also subject to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which, among other things, amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require FDA-regulated food facilities to develop and implement a written food safety plan including a hazard analysis and preventive controls program to minimize or prevent food safety hazards. The FDA also enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. In addition, the USDA requires that establishments under its jurisdiction develop and implement HACCP plans, which require establishments to conduct a hazard analysis and implement critical control points to reduce or eliminate reasonably foreseeable food safety hazards, and Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, which detail procedures to ensure sanitary conditions in the establishment. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of our manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
Labeling and Packaging Regulations
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labels, labeling and, increasingly, website and social media content, the FTC has the primary authority to regulate advertising materials, including online and television advertisements, to determine if advertising materials are misleading, while the USDA requires producers of USDA-regulated products to obtain premarket approval of labels. In addition, we are subject to various state and local consumer protection laws, including laws that allow for private class action litigation challenges to the labeling, marketing and advertising of foods. Labeling for our products must also comply with the Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. We are also subject to the disclosure requirements of California’s Proposition 65, which requires businesses to provide warnings prior to any exposures to a chemical listed by California as a carcinogen or as having reproductive or developmental effects, including food products. 
Milk Regulations
The FDA publishes the Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (the “PMO”), which includes administrative and technical requirements for production, transportation, processing, handling, sampling, examination, labeling and sale of all Grade “A” milk. Some of our products containing milk, including our yogurt products, are subject to compliance with the PMO, in addition to the above-described general regulatory requirements for manufacturing foods. Our products are also subject to manufacturing and labeling requirements for dairy products under state laws, including California state law, which do not always mirror federal requirements.
In addition, the federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat and other milk components, and we pay our suppliers for the raw milk based on the results of these tests. The federal government’s minimum prices for Class II milk vary depending on the processor’s geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into Class II products, such as yogurt) for each month are

announced by the federal government during the immediately preceding month. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also may pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and supplier.
Employee Safety Regulations
We are subject to certain occupational health and safety laws, regulations and directives, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and injuries. Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local standards and requirements, which may change rapidly and with little notice. 
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various local, state and federal environmental laws, regulations and directives that regulate, among other things, environmental protection and the use, generation, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous substances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and analogous state laws. As a food manufacturer, our primary environmental compliance obligations relate to wastewater and solid waste generated by our manufacturing operations and ammonia and Freon used in our refrigerant systems, all of which are subject to special handling requirements. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations and directives or fail to obtain and comply with any requisite permits, we could face substantial fines and penalties, possible revocation of our permits or the imposition of limitations or prohibitions on our operations.
We believe that we are in material compliance with the material environmental laws, regulations and directives applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all environmental laws, regulations and directives or that we will be able to comply with any future requirements or changes in such laws, regulations and directives without significant costs. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future; however, new environmental laws or regulations may be enacted or environmental laws may change or become more stringent over time. If that happens, we do not know whether such changes would require us to make significant, but currently unexpected expenditures.
