Paper Excellence acquired Resolute Forest Products through Domtar Corporation
 On March 1, 2023, the Paper Excellence Group completed the acquisition of Resolute Forest Products Inc. ("Resolute") through Domtar (the “Acquisition”). Under the agreement, Domtar completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Resolute common stock for $20.50 per share and one contingent value right tied to potential refunds on duty deposits made on or prior to June 30, 2022, of up to $500 million. Any proceeds attributable to the contingent value right will be distributed proportionally to contingent value right holders, and the value will ultimately be determined by the terms and timing of the resolution of the softwood lumber dispute between Canada and the United States.
Domtar is financing the transaction with (i) $500 million in equity from Domtar shareholder, and (ii) additional debt financing. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 24 “Subsequent Events” for additional information on this acquisition as well as its financing.
 The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred is approximately $1.6 billion, excluding the contingent value right on softwood lumber duty deposit refunds.
 As a condition to obtain the approval of the Acquisition from the Canadian Competition Bureau, we were required to commit to the divestiture of our Dryden, Ontario pulp mill, within a short period of time following the Acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, the sale of the pulp mill did not meet all the criteria for held for sale. On February 26, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell the mill and related assets for a purchase price of $240 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments and to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023.
 Paper Excellence Acquired Domtar Corporation
 On November 30, 2021, Paper Excellence completed the acquisition of all the outstanding common shares of Domtar Corporation by means of a merger of Pearl Merger Sub (a wholly-owned subsidiary) with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a subsidiary of Paper Excellence (the “Merger”). Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 4 “Acquisition of Business” for additional information on the Merger.
As a condition to obtain the approval of the Merger from the Canadian Competition Bureau, we were required to commit to the divestiture of our Kamloops, British Columbia pulp mill, within a short period of time following the Merger. On June 1, 2022, the mill and related assets, were sold to an independent acquirer approved by the Commissioner. The assets and liabilities related to the pulp mill for periods prior to the sales, were presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the time of the Merger, the sale of the pulp mill met the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings were included within Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 3 “Discontinued Operations” for additional information on the Discontinued Operations.
 
Execution of our asset conversion roadmap
 On August 7, 2020, we announced our decision to repurpose assets at our Kingsport, Tennessee facility, following a review of our manufacturing footprint. This conversion is consistent with the roadmap that we made public in 2018. The previously announced multi-mill conversion roadmap is designed to adjust our paper capacity to align with our customer demand. Through this process, we have identified up to four large scale paper mill repurposing projects that can produce 2.5 million tons of containerboard and/or 570,000 ADMT of additional market softwood and fluff pulp. We have entered the linerboard market with the recent conversion of our Kingsport paper machine. Once in full operation, after the current ramp-up period and customers certification process, the mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market.

PULP AND PAPER
 
Our Manufacturing Operations
 We produce approximately 3.4 million metric tons of softwood and fluff pulp at 11 pulp and paper mills. Approximately 60% of our pulp is consumed internally to manufacture paper, with the balance being sold as market pulp. We also purchase limited amount of papergrade pulp from third parties for specific grades and to optimize the logistics of our pulp capacity while reducing transportation costs.
 We are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. We have eight integrated pulp and paper mills (six in the United States and two in Canada), with an annual paper production capacity of approximately 2.4 million tons of uncoated freesheet paper. Our paper manufacturing operations are supported by eleven converting and forms manufacturing operations (including a network of eight plants located offsite from our paper making operations). Approximately 70% of our paper production capacity is in the United States and 30% is in Canada.
 We have started the operation at our newly converted packaging mill in Kingsport and once in full operation, the mill will manufacture packaging materials made from 100% recycled content. The mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and corrugated medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing market.
We produce papergrade, fluff and specialty pulps at our two stand-alone pulp mills in Dryden and Plymouth. We also produce market pulp in excess of our internal requirements at our pulp and paper mills mainly in Ashdown, Espanola and Marlboro. We can sell approximately 1.4 million metric tons of pulp per year depending on market conditions. Approximately 69% of our pulp production capacity is in the U.S. and 31% is in Canada.

Our Raw Materials
 The manufacturing of pulp and paper requires fiber, chemicals and energy. We discuss these three major raw materials used in our manufacturing operations below.
 Fiber
 United States mills
 The fiber used by our operations in the U.S. is mainly wood fiber (softwood and hardwood) as well as old corrugated containers (”OCC”), all readily available in the market from multiple third-party sources. The mills obtain fiber from a variety of sources, depending on their location. These sources include a combination of supply contracts, wood lot management arrangements, advance stumpage purchases and spot market purchases.
Canadian mills
 The fiber used at our Windsor pulp and paper mill is hardwood originating from a variety of sources, including purchases on the open market in Canada and the U.S., contracts with Quebec wood producers’ marketing boards, public land where we have wood supply allocations and from Domtar’s private lands. The softwood and hardwood fiber for our Espanola pulp and paper mill and the softwood fiber for our Dryden pulp mill are obtained from third parties, directly or indirectly from public lands and through designated wood supply allocations. Access to harvesting fiber on public lands in Ontario and Quebec is subject to licenses and review by the respective governmental authorities.
 Chemicals
 We use various chemical compounds in our manufacturing operations that we purchase, primarily on a centralized basis, through contracts varying between one and ten years in length to ensure product availability. Most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions. For pulp manufacturing, we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, lime and peroxide. For paper manufacturing, we also use several chemical products including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, optical brighteners, dyes and aluminum sulfate.
Energy
 Our operations produce and consume substantial amounts of energy. Our primary energy sources include: biomass, natural gas and electricity. Approximately 70% of the total energy required to manufacture our products comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent pulping liquor, generated as byproducts from our manufacturing processes. The remainder of the energy comes mainly from natural gas and from smaller amounts of other fossil fuels and purchased steam procured under supply contracts. Under most of these contracts, suppliers are committed to provide quantities within predetermined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing that fluctuate based on prevailing market conditions. Biomass and fossil fuels are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and, to a lesser extent, to provide direct heat used in the chemical recovery process.
 We have cogenerating assets at all of our integrated pulp and paper mills, as well as hydro assets at three locations: Espanola, Nekoosa and Rothschild. These generating assets produce approximately 65% of the electricity requirements of our manufacturing operations, with the balance supplied from local utilities. Electricity is primarily used to drive motors, pumps and other equipment, as well as provide lighting.
Our Transportation
 Transportation of fiber, chemicals and pulp into our mills is mostly done by rail and trucks, although barges are used in certain circumstances. We rely on third parties for the transportation of our pulp and paper products between our mills, converting operations, distribution centers and customers. Our paper products are shipped mostly by truck, with logistics operations and procurement being managed centrally in collaboration with each location. Our pulp is either shipped by vessel, rail or truck depending on destination and customer preference. We work with major railroads, ocean carriers, and approximately 390 trucking and third-party transportation companies in the U.S. and Canada. Service agreements are typically negotiated on an annual basis. We pay diesel fuel surcharges, which vary depending on the cost of diesel fuel and mode of transportation used.
 Our Product Offering
Paper
Our paper products are categorized into both communication papers and specialty and packaging papers. Communication papers are further categorized into business papers and commercial printing and publishing papers.


Our business papers include copy and electronic imaging papers, which are used with inkjet and laser printers, photocopiers and plain-paper fax machines, as well as computer papers, preprinted forms and digital papers. These products are primarily for office and home use. Business papers accounted for approximately 47% of our shipments of paper products in 2022.
 Our commercial printing and publishing papers include uncoated freesheet papers, such as offset papers and opaques. These uncoated freesheet grades are used in sheet and roll fed offset presses across the spectrum of commercial printing end-uses, including digital printing. Our publishing papers include tradebook and lightweight uncoated papers used primarily in book publishing applications such as textbooks, dictionaries, catalogs, magazines, hard cover novels and financial documents. These products also include converting papers, such as envelopes, tablets, business forms and data processing/computer forms. Commercial printing and publishing papers accounted for approximately 36% of our shipments of paper products in 2022.
 Our specialty and packaging papers include papers used for thermal printing, flexible packaging, food packaging, medical packaging, medical gowns and drapes, sandpaper backing, carbonless printing, labels and other papers used for coating and laminating applications. We also manufacture papers for industrial and specialty applications including carrier papers, treated papers, security papers and specialized printing and converting applications. These specialty and packaging papers accounted for approximately 17% of our shipments of paper products in 2022. These grades of papers require a certain amount of innovation and agility in the manufacturing system. Once our ramp-up period and client certification processes are completed in 2023 at our newly converted packaging mill, we will be able to offer our customers a full range of 100% recycled linerboard and medium, including: linerboard, corrugated medium, sack kraft and other packaging grades.
 We sell business papers primarily to paper stationers, merchants, office equipment manufacturers and retail outlets. We distribute uncoated commercial printing and publishing papers to end-users and commercial printers, mainly through paper merchants, as well as selling directly to some end-users. We sell our specialty and packaging papers mainly to converters, who apply a further production process such as coating, rewinding, folding or waxing to our papers before selling them to a variety of specialized end-users.
 Pulp
 Our pulp products are comprised of softwood and fluff as well as high quality airlaid and ultrathin laminated absorbent cores. Our pulp grades are sold to customers in approximately 50 countries worldwide and are used in a variety of end-products, such as diapers and personal hygiene products, bathroom and facial tissue, specialty and packaging papers, customers who make printing and writing grades, building products and electrical insulating papers. Our laminated cores are used in the manufacturing of baby diapers, adult incontinence and feminine hygiene products.
 We sell market pulp to customers in North America mainly through a North American sales force, while sales to most overseas customers are made directly or through commission agents. We maintain pulp supplies at strategically located warehouses, which allow us to respond to customer orders on short notice.
Our Customers
 Our ten largest customers represented approximately 48% of our sales in 2022. In 2022, Staples represented approximately 13% of our sales. The majority of our customers purchase products through individual purchase orders. In 2022, approximately 77% of our sales were in the United States, 10% were in Canada, and 13% were in other countries.
 OUR COMPETITION
 The markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers.
 In the paper business, our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas, except in highly specialized papers or customized products. In uncoated freesheet, we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering, service solutions and competitively priced paper products, which include an extensive offering of high-quality Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”)-certified paper products. While we have a leading position in the North American uncoated freesheet market, we also compete with other paper grades, including coated freesheet, and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As the use of these alternative products continues to grow, we continue to see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products. All of our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S. or in Canada where we sell approximately 87% of our products. The five largest manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in North America (including Domtar) represent approximately 82% of total production capacity. On a global basis, there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet paper. The level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the North American market is highly dependent upon exchange rates, particularly the rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro as well as the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.
 The pulp we sell is mainly fluff or softwood pulp. The pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of product quality and competitively priced pulp products. We sell softwood and fluff pulp that is used in absorbent products, incontinence products, diapers and feminine hygiene products. We sell both northern and southern bleached softwood pulp. We also produce specialty engineered pulp grades with a predetermined mix of wood species. Our northern and southern softwood pulp is sold to customers that make a variety of products for specialty paper, packaging, tissue and industrial applications, and

customers who make printing and writing grades. Airlaid and ultrathin laminated absorbent cores are highly customized and specialized for customer needs and have a relatively long and technical development, qualification and sales process. We also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the FSC chain-of-custody standard and the procurement of FSC-certified virgin fiber. All of our pulp production capacity is located in the U.S. or in Canada, and we sell approximately 46% of our pulp to other countries.
 OUR HUMAN CAPITAL
We have approximately 6,300 employees, 65% are employed in the United States and 35% in Canada. 56% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, generally on a facility-by-facility basis.
We are committed to fostering a workplace that attracts and retains talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety, employee well-being and community engagement, we aim to directly influence positive work behavior and on-the-job performance.
Diversity and Inclusion
 Although we have a strict non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, we view diversity and inclusion as more than just policies and practices. It is part of who we are, how we operate, and essential to our long-term sustainability. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work and feel valued and included.
 Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse senior leadership. We are committed to increasing representation of women and underrepresented minorities at Domtar overall, but particularly in leadership roles. The Domtar Diversity and Inclusion Council provides guidance to leadership to help make Domtar more inclusive and diverse.
To ensure leadership maintains a commitment to diversity and inclusion, each leader is responsible for focusing on how they can develop and support diversity within the workplace and within their scope of responsibilities.
Compensation and Pay Equity
 Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark, and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role, experience and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.
Learning and Development
 Hiring, developing and retaining employees is important to our operations and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth, performance and retention. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and on-site learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development.
Health and Safety
The physical health, life balance and mental health of our employees is part of our core value of caring and thus is of vital importance to Domtar. That is why we work relentlessly to physically eliminate the potential for life-altering hazards and minimize risk of injury as part of a proactive, preventive safety culture while investing in well-being programs to help our employees establish and maintain healthy lifestyles.
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers. Shortly after the outset of COVID-19, we adopted enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensured a reliable supply of essential products to our customers. We monitor the impact of the pandemic on our employees and within our operations, and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety.
 Community Involvement
 We make donations to charitable organizations in the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We also offer employees the opportunity to volunteer in their communities through our Domtar EarthChoice Ambassadors program. We focus our philanthropic efforts on three areas that align with our business: literacy, sustainability, and health and wellness.
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
 Domtar aims to deliver value to our customers, employees and communities by viewing our business decisions within the larger context of sustainability. We take a long-term view on managing natural resources for the future. We strive to minimize waste and encourage recycling. We aim to have the highest standards for ethical conduct, for caring about the health and safety of each other, and for maintaining the environmental quality in the communities where we live and work. We value the partnerships we have formed with non-governmental organizations and believe they make us a better Company. We focus on agility to respond to new opportunities, and we are committed to turning innovation into value creation. By embracing sustainability as our operating philosophy, we seek to internalize the fact that the choices we have and the impact of the decisions we make on our stakeholders are all interconnected. We believe that our business and the people and communities who depend on us are better served as we weave this focus on sustainability into the things we do.
 Domtar executes this commitment to sustainability at every level and every location across the Company. Our Management Committee empowers senior managers from manufacturing, technology, finance, sales and marketing and corporate staff functions to regularly come together and establish key sustainability performance metrics, and to routinely assess and report on progress. Our sustainability goals, challenges and progress are reported annually on the Company’s website and other published reports.
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 Our business is subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada, relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing wood harvesting, air emissions, climate change, waste water discharges, storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, contaminated sites, landfill operation and closure obligations and health and safety matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business. We may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements, possibly leading to civil or criminal fines, penalties or enforcement actions, including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs, such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions.
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. Additional information regarding environmental matters is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 20 “Commitments and Contingencies” and in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the section of Critical accounting estimates and policies, under the caption “Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations.”
