Our portfolio of products targets every type of fitness enthusiast and professional, from combat sport, weight training, bodybuilding, running, and all team and individual sports, as well as individuals who lead an active lifestyle.
  
  We place considerable emphasis on transparency, high-quality ingredients, innovation and science.

Tests performed on products include banned substance testing and protein verification, among others.

This line of award-winning, independently-tested products helps to fuel athletes safely by increasing strength, energy, endurance, recovery and overall athletic performance.

  On-the-Go – As more and more consumers are seeking healthier and convenient snacking options, retailers across multiple channels are capitalizing on this emerging trend by aggressively expanding their assortments to accommodate this demand. The On-the-Go portfolio of ready to eat products includes the award winning Combat Crunch, Protein Crisp, Organic Protein and Protein Cookie.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 Our goal is to position MusclePharm as the “must have” brand for elite athletes and fitness enthusiasts, alike, who are on a journey to holistically better themselves and achieve their maximum potential. Our marketing is focused on our most prominent products and includes brand partnerships, focusing on grass-roots marketing and advertising efforts with athletes and retail outlets close to our core audience. Our marketing includes digital marketing, sampling, public relations, athlete/influencer marketing, event marketing, trade activity, paid media, advertising, SEO/SEM, and affiliate marketing. Our roster of elite athletes, influencers and brand ambassadors play a role in our marketing. New product innovation is also a key component of driving incremental sales.
 Distribution Channels
  
  MusclePharm brands are marketed across major global retail distribution channels – Specialty, International and Food, Drug, and Mass (“FDM”). Our largest customers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”), Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), and iHerb, LLC (“iHerb”) accounted for approximately 33%, 13% and 17% of our 2019 net revenue, respectively. Costco, Amazon and iHerb accounted for approximately 29%, 13% and 13% of our 2018 net revenue, respectively. For further information concerning our customer concentration, see Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
  
  Specialty: This channel is comprised of brick-and-mortar sales and e-commerce. Due to high competition within this market, we continually seek to respond to customer trends and shifts by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new innovative products and influencing preferences through our marketing. We experienced significant growth in online sales in 2019, primarily through our Amazon and iHerb distribution channels.

  International: Our international reach touches every relevant market in the world. We seek to further grow our international sales by continuing to offer new products in key markets as well as opening new distribution channels in select regions of the world. We also are evaluating the benefits of developing expanded manufacturing partnerships outside of North America to take advantage of local opportunities.
 
  FDM: This channel is primarily served by our direct sales force, as well as our network of brokers. We believe direct relationships with retail partners provide us an opportunity to expand our distribution into additional discount warehouses and national retailers.
  
  Below is a table of net revenue by our major distribution channel:

 Product Research, Development and Quality Control
  
  Customers’ belief in the safety and efficacy of our products is critical. Continued innovation in delivery techniques and ingredients, new product line extensions, and new product offerings are important in order to sustain existing and create new market opportunities, meet consumer demand, and strengthen consumer relationships. To support our research and development efforts, we invest in formulation, processing and packaging development, perform product quality and stability studies, and conduct consumer market research to sample consumer opinions on product concepts, design, packaging, advertising, and marketing campaigns.
 
  We are committed to science and sport being equal in our product development. We believe real-world applications are essential. Our state-of-the-art, 20,000 square-foot professional training and performance facility in Burbank, California is dedicated to optimizing the performance of our products for all ranges of athletes. Collecting feedback from athletes in our facility helps our team strive to improve our products and to continue to be innovative. Our product lines have been developed through a stringent protocol to ensure that all formulations promote quality and safety for our customers. Our quality control team follows detailed supplier selection and certification processes, validation of raw material verification processes, analytical testing, process audits, and other quality control procedures. Our products are also subject to extensive shelf life stability testing. We also engage third-party laboratories to routinely evaluate and validate our internal testing processes on every MusclePharm product.
 
  We qualify ingredients, suppliers, and facilities by performing site assessments and conducting on-going performance and process reviews. Dedicated quality teams regularly audit and assess manufacturing facilities for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”), as regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), to ensure our compliance with all MusclePharm, regulatory, and certification standards and requirements. To ensure overall consistency, our quality assurance team adheres to strict written procedures. From the raw ingredient stage to the finished product stage, we monitor and perform quality control checks. Before distributing our products, we place our products under quarantine to test for environmental contaminants and verify that the finished product meets label claims. Once a product has successfully passed quality assurance testing and conforms to specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, we then conduct testing with third-party laboratories for added label claim verification. Multi-level practices are part of our product development process to ensure athletes and our consumers receive what we believe to be the most scientifically innovative and safest products on the market. Post-distribution, we have standard operating procedures in place for investigating and documenting any adverse events or product quality complaints. We are committed to the process of having all of our products certified to be banned-substance-free before they are available to consumers. Informed Choice, a globally recognized leader in sports testing, conducts all of our third-party banned substance testing, ensuring that all MusclePharm products are free of banned substances.
  
  Manufacturing and Distribution
  
  We have relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers. Certain of our vendors supply in excess of 10% of our products. Once a product is manufactured, it is sent to our distribution center in Spring Hill, Tennessee, or shipped directly to the customer. All of the third-party manufacturing facilities that we source from and distribution facilities are designed and operated to meet current GMP standards as promulgated by the FDA.
   The manufacturing process performed by our third-party manufacturers generally consists of the following operations: (i) qualifying ingredients for products; (ii) testing of all raw ingredients; (iii) measuring ingredients for inclusion in production; (iv) granulating, blending and grinding ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency; (v) encapsulating or filling the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment; and (vi) testing finished products prior to distribution.

  We maintain and operate a system that integrates distribution, warehousing, and quality control. This provides real-time lot and quality tracking of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. We employ a supply chain staff that works with sales, marketing, product development, and quality control personnel to ensure that only products that meet all specifications are produced and released to customers.
  
  Our Competitors
  
  The sports nutrition market is very competitive, and the range of products is diverse and subject to rapid and frequent changes in consumer demand. Competitors use price, shelf space and store placement, brand and product recognition, new product introductions, and raw materials to capture market share. We believe that retailers look to partner with suppliers who demonstrate brand development, market intelligence, customer service, and produce high quality products with proven science. We believe we are competitive in all of these areas.
  
  Our competitors include numerous nutritional companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, we compete with large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial and distribution resources available to them than us and some compete through vertical integration. Private label entities have gained a foothold in many nutrition categories and also are direct competitors. Our principal competitors are: Glanbia Performance Nutrition (Optimum Nutrition), Nutrabolt, (Cellucor C4), Dymatize Enterprises LLC, and Iovate Health Sciences International Inc. As many of our competitors are either privately held or divisions within larger organizations, it is difficult to fully gauge their size and relative ranking.
  
  Government Regulation
  
  The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, storage, and sale of each of our product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies. The most active of these is the FDA, which regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDCA defines the terms “food” and “dietary supplement” and sets forth various requirements that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most recently by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the “NLEA”) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.
  
  FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA regulations require us and our third-party manufacturers to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations for the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements.
   Our business practices and products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency. Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold.
  
  In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and initiating or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local consultants and authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our intellectual property is crucial to the continued successful implementation of our business strategy. Since we regard our intellectual property as a crucial element of our business with significant value in the marketing of our products, our policy is to rigorously pursue registrations for all trademarks associated with our products.
  
  We have over 55 trademark applications in the United States, 53 of which are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Our registered trademarks include registrations of our house marks, as well as marks associated with our core product lines.
  
  We also have filed for protection of various marks throughout the world and are committed to a significant long-term strategy to build and protect the MusclePharm brand globally. We have applied for the “MusclePharm” mark effective in 37 countries, including the United States. The mark has been granted final trademark registration effective in all 37 of those countries.
