Item 1. Business.



Nukkleus Inc. (formerly known as, Compliance & Risk Management Solutions Inc.) (the “Company” or “Nukkleus”) was formed on July 29, 2013 in the State of Delaware as a for-profit Company and established a fiscal year end of September 30.



Overview



We are a financial technology company with the aim of providing blockchain-enabled technology solutions.



Nukkleus Technology



Our Nukkleus Technology business unit offers a full-service transactions technology and advisory business providing end-to-end transactions technology solutions. We offer an advanced transactions platform for dealing and risk management with global liquidity and customizable leverage, where users have control over quote and liquidity strategies. Such technology and advisory services are currently offered through our General Services Agreement (“GSA”) with FXDD (for more information see the section captioned “FXDD Agreements” below).



Digital RFQ



Through our Digital RFQ subsidiary, we aim to provide cross-border payment and transactions solutions to institutional investors, and offer blockchain-enabled financial services solutions to institutional investors in a secure, compliant and globally accessible manner. The blockchain-enabled payment gateway we have developed has the capability to deliver global cross-border transfers of fiat currencies using blockchain rails. Digital RFQ currently offers payment and settlement services, including those utilizing blockchain networks, but does not provide custody or wallet services with respect to digital assets, and does not hold digital assets, reducing the risks and regulatory burden on its business. In future, Digital RFQ plans to offer a white-labelled digital bank with end-to-end digital banking solutions for international business. We expect to offer these products in the second or third calendar quarter of 2023. Our competitors in this product category are banks and other financial institutions, and we intend to compete by offering faster and more reliable products using more advanced technology. Products and services offered by Digital RFQ are distributed through our website.



Digital RFQ is regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority and is in good standing and is and has been in the past in material compliance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations promulgated thereby. Digital RFQ is subject to Anti Money Laundering (“AML”) and Counter Terrorist Finance (“CTF”) regulations consistent with our authorization by the Financial Conduct Authority as an Electronic Money Directive Agent, among others. For a discussion of the various laws and regulations Digital RFQ is subject.



The “blockchain technology” used by Digital RFQ in its payment processing business includes only advanced-stage and fully tested, well-established and fully collateralized stablecoins operated on the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tron networks. However, in future, we will be free to use other blockchain networks if we determine that they offer more sophisticated or secure technology. Based on our risk assessments, we determine the appropriate network to use for a particular transaction or customer. We do not use stablecoins of an algorithmic nature, and in the event that we determine any particular stablecoin presents a threat or risk to the security of our business, customers or the transactions we process, we promptly move to another stablecoin network. We do not accept payment in digital assets and do not hold digital assets for investment or offer digital wallet services. For a description of the risks associated with the use of blockchain technology in financial services generally, and payment processing specifically.



DigiClear



Through DigiClear, we plan to develop technology that offers a custody and settlement utility operating system aiming to deliver value and a high-functioning automated post-trade solution. DigiClear aims to provide clients with the means to transfer underlying assets to alternative custodians at any time. We intend for DigiClear to use hardware security modules to offer technology that can secure client assets to block any unwanted modification of client settlement instructions or transfers. We expect that the transfer process that DigiClear’s technology will offer will be fully automated, monitored and can be processed within milliseconds. We expect to offer these products in the second or third calendar quarter of 2023. Our competitors in this product category are banks and other financial institutions and smaller financial technology companies, and we intend to compete by offering faster and more reliable products using more advanced technology. Products and services offered by DigiClear are distributed through our website.

Pursuant to terms of the White Lion Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Nukkleus is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares to be acquired by White Lion within sixty days following the closing of the previously announced business combination with Brilliant Acquisition Corporation described in Nukkleus’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022 (the “Business Combination”).



The term of the White Lion Agreement commences on the effective date of the registration statement and shall end on December 31, 2024, or, if earlier, the date on which White Lion has purchased the maximum number of shares of Nukkleus Common Stock provided under the White Lion Agreement, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the White Lion Agreement. White Lion’s purchase price will be 96% of the dollar- volume weighted average price of Nukkleus common stock over the two consecutive trading days immediately following receipt of Nukkleus’s notice of its intent to make a draw.



During the term of the White Lion Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Nukkleus may draw up to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Nukkleus common stock which would result in beneficial ownership by White Lion of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Nukkleus common stock, (ii) the number of shares of Nukkleus common stock equal to 30% of the average daily trading volume of Nukkleus common stock over the five consecutive trading days immediately following the notice date, or (iii) the number of Nukkleus common stock obtained by dividing $1,500,000 by the closing sale price of Nukkleus common stock on the notice date.

FXDD Agreements



On May 24, 2016, Nukkleus Limited entered into a General Service Agreement to provide its software, technology, customer sales and marketing and risk management technology hardware and software solutions package to FML Malta Ltd. In December 2017, Nukkleus Limited, FML Malta Ltd. and Triton Capital Markets Ltd. (“TCM”) entered into a letter agreement providing that there was an error in drafting the General Service Agreement and acknowledging that the correct counter-party to Nukkleus Limited in the General Service Agreement is TCM. Accordingly, all references to FML Malta Ltd. have been replaced with TCM. TCM is a private limited liability company formed under the laws of Malta. The General Service Agreement entered with TCM provides that TCM will pay Nukkleus Limited at minimum $2,000,000 per month. On October 17, 2017, Nukkleus Limited entered into an amendment of the General Service Agreement with TCM. In accordance with the amendment, which was effective as of October 1, 2017, the minimum amount payable by TCM to Nukkleus Limited for services was reduced from $2,000,000 per month to $1,600,000 per month. Emil Assentato is also the majority member of Max Q Investments LLC (“Max Q”), which is managed by Derivative Marketing Associates Inc. (“DMA”). Mr. Assentato is the sole owner and manager of DMA. Max Q owns 79% of Currency Mountain Malta LLC, which in turn is the sole shareholder of TCM.



In addition, on May 24, 2016, in order to appropriately service TCM, Nukkleus Limited entered into a General Service Agreement with FXDIRECT, which provides that Nukkleus Limited will pay FXDIRECT a minimum of $1,975,000 per month in consideration of providing personnel engaged in operational and technical support, marketing, sales support, accounting, risk monitoring, documentation processing and customer care and support. FXDIRECT may terminate this agreement upon providing 90 days’ written notice. On October 17, 2017, Nukkleus Limited entered into an amendment of the General Service Agreement with FXDIRECT. Pursuant to the amendment, which was effective as of October 1, 2017, the minimum amount payable by Nukkleus Limited to FXDIRECT for services was reduced from $1,975,000 per month to $1,575,000 per month. Currency Mountain Holdings LLC is the sole shareholder of FXDIRECT. Max Q is the majority shareholder of Currency Mountain Holdings LLC.



The foregoing descriptions of the terms and conditions of the General Services Agreement with FML Malta Ltd, the amendment to such General Services Agreement, and the General Services Agreement with FXDIRECT are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the applicable agreement, which are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.5, Exhibit 10.6 and Exhibit 10.7, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.



The Market Opportunity



The FX market is a global, decentralized market for the trading of currencies. Nukkleus’s management believes that FX trading involves the simultaneous buying and selling of a currency pair for the purposes of hedging currency risk or to generate a profit. Nukkleus’s management believes that the FX market, once limited to large financial institutions, has expanded and matured over the past decade, and now captures a wide range of participants, including central banks, commercial banks, non-bank corporations, hedge funds, brokers and individual investors and traders. The market’s expansion has helped lead to a significant increase in trading activity. In addition to the increase in the breadth of market participants, management believes the key factors driving higher transaction volumes include the adoption of electronic and high frequency trading, tighter trading spreads, rising volatility among currencies and enhanced access to FX trading markets — primarily through online brokers, such as FXDD — for retail investors.

Management believes that FX trading, initially utilized primarily for hedging purposes, has evolved as investor sophistication levels have risen, trading costs have fallen, and as currencies have become increasingly viewed as a viable investment asset class. FX’s low, (or even negative) correlation among certain other portfolio assets, namely equities and fixed income, may help investors reduce overall portfolio volatility. As such, we believe that currencies are often viewed as an important portfolio diversification tool.



Fueled by the growing adoption of the internet, the retail segment of the FX market began to emerge in the late 1990s. Developing online brokerage firms provided individual investors with direct access to the global FX markets. Prior to the development of these trading platforms, we believe that individual retail investors were effectively locked out of the FX market as minimum trade sizes were typically too high for individual retail investors. Online FX brokers lowered the minimum volume barriers and transactions costs for retail trading, allowing individuals to establish trading accounts with much lower initial deposits. We believe the retail FX segment now represents the fastest growing portion of the overall FX market. We believe this growth will be driven by a handful of key market trends, including:




● | Increased investor demand for exposure to currencies; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing internet adoption across the globe; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing engagement of the “offline” market; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development of emerging markets and the emergence of an affluent middle class; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing regulation resulting in greater confidence. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Participants in the retail FX market are geographically dispersed. Retail FX brokers, such as FXDD are seeking to expand their presence in projected high growth regional areas, such as Asia and the Middle East.

Category One: Introducing Broker Dealer Network



Nukkleus, by arrangement pursuant to our services agreement with TCM and FXDIRECT, provides to TCM clients an introducing broker (IB) network spread across China, Japan and the Middle East. Our approach to the retail FX market is to focus on the development of relationships with independent local referring brokers who provide a recurring source of new customers. These referring brokers do not have an exclusive relationship with us, but are offered a competitive commission structure to deliver new customers to us. Our account managers primarily focus on building relationships with referring brokers, and master referring brokers (who refer other referring brokers to us), as well as with customers referred to us by referring brokers and acquired by us directly. We believe this approach, in contrast to retail FX brokers that focus solely or primarily on acquiring accounts through online marketing campaigns, has allowed us to provide services to TCM, which allows entities to achieve strong levels of net trading income, and accounts, as well as lower up front customer acquisition costs and greater customer satisfaction. Referring brokers are typically either individuals who are current or former FX traders or individuals or companies active in the area of FX trading and education and investment services advisory business.



The Introducing Broker Interface: The Introducing Broker (“IB”) interface empowers our partners to view real time account data such as payouts, customer activity and reports.

We obtained the services of account managers by virtue of our services agreement with FXDIRECT. Account managers are compensated to a significant degree based on their performance, measured by net deposits inflows, new accounts funded and transaction volume generated by customers. We believe that this compensation structure motivates our account managers and leads to more active communication with our referring brokers and customers, an improved customer trading experience, improved referring broker and customer retention and increased deposits.
