Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Capstone Companies, Inc. (“Company” or “CAPC”) is a public holding company organized under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer inspired products that simplify daily living through technology.  Over the past decade, the Company’s various product lines have been distributed globally including consumer markets in Australia, Japan, Korea, North America, South America, and the United Kingdom. The primary operating subsidiary is Capstone Industries, Inc. (“CAPI”), a Florida corporation located at the principal executive offices of the Company.  To oversee and manage business activities in the Pacific Rim, the Company established Capstone International Hong Kong, Ltd., or "CIHK", allowing it to expand the Company's product development, engineering, and factory resource capabilities.  The Company has a history of exploiting technologies in areas of induction charging, power failure control, security and home LED lighting products and most recently has entered the electronics market with its introduction of Capstone’s Connected Surfaces Smart Mirrors – Internet connected and interactive mirror.
 
The Company's focus through 2017 has been in the integration of LEDs into most commonly used consumer lighting products in today's home.  Over the last few years there has been significant LED price erosion, which has commoditized LED consumer products.  The LED category has matured and is no longer the innovative “must have” consumer product as in previous years. The Connected Surfaces is the Company’s effort to establish a new product line.
 
Capstone’s success has been in its ability to identify emerging product categories where Capstone’s management experience can be fully leveraged.  Over the past decade, the Company’s consistent low-cost manufacturing and operations have provided an advantage in delivering quality products at very competitive prices.
 
In late 2017, as management recognized that the LED category was maturing, it sought a business opportunity that would transition the Company’s revenue streams to emerging new product category.  While we currently continue to supply LED products on a limited basis, our strategic plan to develop and launch new innovative product lines, like Connected Surfaces’ Smart Mirrors, is believed to be essential for sustaining or growing revenues.
 
Our expectation is that the new portfolio of Connected Surfaces appeals to a much larger audience than our traditional LED lighting product line.  The new Connected Surfaces portfolio is designed to tap into consumer’s ever-expanding connected lifestyles prevalent today. The products have both touch screen and voice interfacing, internet access and an operating system capable of running downloadable applications. The average selling prices will be comparable to that of tablets and smartphones, expected retails to start at $699.00 per unit, with the goal to deliver consumer value to mainstream America.  Whereas, during the day your smartphone/tablet keeps you connected, whether it is work or personal, now when entering your home, Capstone’s new Connected Surfaces products will enable users the same level of connectivity in a more relaxed manner that does not require being tethered to these devices.
 
The Company's financial initiatives are driven by its entry to new distribution channels and calls for an increased emphasis on an e-commerce business model.  As a result of the pandemic, retail foot traffic has been diminished substantially and e-commerce platforms have advanced with consumers across all product lines.  The Connected Surfaces category is intended to find its way to retail shelves after it has been established through its direct-to-consumer effort.  The Company’s marketing strategy will shift its historic reliance on ‘Big Box’ retailers while delivering more profitable business.  If Connected Surfaces is successful, the gross margins generated by the e-commerce model should be substantially greater than in the past and should provide strong cash flows.  The Company will require additional funding to build its marketing effort, inventory levels and service levels once the initial marketing phase validates the Company’s strategic initiatives.  The future growth will be directly impacted by the level of exposure, messaging and distribution capabilities.  For the short-term, certain members of Company management (“Corporate Insiders and Directors”) have stated an intent to continue supporting the Company’s basic operational funding needs.

 The Company has historically competed in highly competitive consumer market channels that can be affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors such as, consumer confidence, employment levels, credit availability, commodity costs and the recovery from the global pandemic.  As stated earlier, the markets for LED home products have matured and growth within the category will continue to decline as markets are saturated.  While we will continue to maintain supply for the short-term, our focus is directed to the expansion and advancement of the Company’s Connected Surfaces initiative.
 
By working diligently overseas with alternate manufacturers located outside China, particularly in Thailand, we anticipate minimal impact to our selling prices and related margins of profit that could otherwise be impacted by an ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. Political unrest in Thailand in late 2020 and early 2021 has not affected our OEM activities as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K report.
 
COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial disruption to travel, business activities, and global supply chains, significant volatility in global financial markets, and resulted in a dramatic increase in unemployment, particularly in the U.S.


As the products we have shipped on our direct import business model typically requires 3 to 4 months lead time, our revenue in 2020 was significantly impacted by the uncertainty of reduced consumer foot traffic in the stores during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This uncertainty caused retail buyers to delay or postpone promotional events.  During recent months as consumer confidence has increased and the public has become more accustomed and feel safer about visiting stores, in store foot traffic has increased, particularly in the discount warehouse retailers (“Warehouse Clubs”) that we sell in.  The promotional activities both domestically and internationally in the Warehouse Club channel have gradually increased as compared to previous quarters. Subject to the mass vaccination commenced in January 2021 ending or substantially curbing the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe retail buying confidence will continue to improve and expect that promotional opportunities will begin to normalize for the 3rd and 4th quarters 2021.
 
One factor that may impact improvement in store foot traffic in 2021 is the emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, which variants appear to be more contagious and, by virtue of being more highly contagious, may cause a spike in COVID-19 infections and a resulting imposition of renewed restrictions on store foot traffic in certain regions.  Further, it has not been determined if the current COVID-19 vaccines are effective against all new variants of the COVID-19 virus.  Full vaccination of a large percentage of the American population to develop ‘herd’ immunity prior to emergence of a new variant of COVID-19 virus that is not controlled by available vaccines is widely viewed by public health officials as critical to return to normality in activities - like pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels of store foot traffic.  While the Company has commenced in March 2021 a new e-commerce initiative on its product website, that efforts has just commenced, and it is unclear as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K report if our e-commerce initiative will compensate for loss of extensive store foot traffic.
 
 During the year, the Company has experienced some limitations in employee resources resulting from travel restrictions and “stay at home” orders.  Despite these restrictions, the Company continues to efficiently manage the overseas supply chain requirements of our customers.
 
Since early 2020, the Company has been building its infrastructure to transition into the online retail business by developing an e-commerce website.  E-commerce increasingly is the means by which consumer purchase products, and it has experienced substantial increases during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Company saw a change in consumer buying trend before the COVID-19 pandemic impact and has been investing in developing a social media presence over the last year and is now ready to officially launch shipping product by its online Smart Mirror business in April 2021.  Prior to 2021, the Company relied on brick and mortar retail for sale of its products to consumers and sought to piggyback off retailers’ e-commerce websites as well as dedicated online retailers like Amazon.

 We believe the COVID-19 virus will continue to impact retail store markets through the first half of 2021, perhaps longer if mass vaccination does not reduce the national economic impact on and severity of COVID-19 pandemic by the summer of 2021,  but as we focus our channel strategy toward e-commerce, disruption to our business in 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail store market should be moderated if our e-commerce efforts create sufficient revenues.  Consumer confidence should rise commensurately with increased job opportunities and income recovery upon a decrease of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The extent to which COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Company’s results will depend primarily on future developments, including the severity and duration of the crisis, the speed and effectiveness of the national vaccine inoculation program, potential mutations of COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of future actions that will be taken to contain COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact.  These future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, especially if mutations of the COVID-19 virus become widespread and prove resistant to vaccines.


We continue to make investments to ensure that we provide quality, useful products. Additionally, the Company continues to enhance its customer service support. In 2020 and 2019, the Company substantially expanded its investment and commitment to social media marketing. With the growing importance of on-line commerce and social media to consumers, this marketing will play a vital role in expanding our lifestyle brands and will also serve to establish credibility with the Company’s growing consumer base. The effort will focus on creating a more extensive and aggressive social media presence through use of third-party social media like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.  Continued analytics will govern and refine our investments in these social media campaigns.
 
As the Company focuses on e-commerce as an important distribution channel for its new product line, it faces intense competition from established, competing e-commerce websites as well as the daunting challenge of attracting consumer attention through social media and online marketing.  Consumers have many options in e-commerce.  The Company is not using online sponsors or promoters, known as ‘influencers,’ but rather is relying on a traditional promotion on social media websites like Facebook. There has not been sufficient operating experience with the Company e-commerce effort to opine on its effectiveness.
 
The Company oversees and controls the manufacturing of its products, which are currently made in China and Thailand by OEM contract manufacturers, through three wholly owned operating subsidiaries: CAPI, CIHK and CLTL. To support the current e-commerce model that will drive our business in 2021, we will be putting inventories into warehouse facilities stateside for direct-to-consumer fulfillment.  When introducing the Connected Surfaces program to Big Box retailers in the back half of 2021, the Company will resume its direct import model. At that time, the Company's products will be built to order for specific promotional periods and does not require replenishment domestically.  While the Company is stressing establishing an e-commerce presence, sales of products through brick and mortar retail stores of retailers will remain part of distribution of product and sale to consumers. The effectiveness of the national vaccination program to allow a return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic economy and revival of consumer store front traffic will be key to our brick and mortar retail efforts for the Connected Surface products.
 
CIHK continually evaluates its contract manufacturers' ability to meet the Company's growing needs. Additionally, all manufacturers must meet rigorous compliance, security and equipment evaluation audits to ensure competitive pricing for the highest quality products. Capstone’s business practices have allowed development of excellent relationships with its OEM contract manufacturers and has resulted in commercially favorable payment terms, which over the years has greatly contributed to the Company's growth.
 
To date all of the Company's retail sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the Company's business did not provide visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.
 
With the launch of the Connected Surfaces online business and to ensure adequate inventory supply for the new product category in order to support immediate e-commerce shipments, the Company will be forecasting its initial inventory needs and adjust accordingly as sales volumes are established.

LED Business and Transition to Connected Surfaces. Capstone was an early innovator in the introduction of low-cost LED lighting products that have distinctive features creating strong consumer appeal.  The Company's product lines consisted of decorative lighting, outdoor fixtures, lighting with built-in power failure technology and safety and security.  Since the beginning of fiscal year 2007, the Company has been primarily engaged in the business of developing, marketing, and selling home LED products (“Lighting Products”) through national and regional retailers in North America and in certain overseas markets.  The Company’s lighting products are targeted for applications such as home indoor and outdoor lighting and have different functionalities to meet consumer’s needs.
 
The Company has now developed and is marketing a smart mirror which is the first introduction within the Capstone Connected Surfaces program.  The initial launch was at the Consumer Electronics Show in early 2020 but its release to the retail market has been delayed due to product development delays at our suppliers, resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The Company is planning production immediately following the varying certification processes and testing required for North American products, which are currently underway. These are not unfamiliar steps to management, as all our products are subject to most of the same approval processes; however, we do not control the speed at which the testing companies advance. There is a backlog at the testing laboratories as so many companies were dormant for the past 12 months but are now resuming normal business activities. As of the filing of this Form 10-K report, we are planning production to commence in April.  As necessary, we will air-freight initial inventories to the U.S.so that we may activate our Amazon program, which requires that inventory be available for immediate delivery in their facilities. Depending on availability of containers, which are now facing shortages in the region, we may have to compromise our margins on the early shipments and ship more product by air than planned. Our primary goal  is to deliver mirrors to our customers that have been patiently waiting for the mirrors to be available.
 
The development of the smart interactive mirror or “Smart Mirrors”  is part of the Company’s strategic effort to find new product lines to replace or supplement existing products that are nearing or at the end of their product life cycle.
 
In 2020, the Company's operations consist of one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Lighting Products.  Connected Surfaces products were recently introduced, and segment results will be reported in future interim reporting for 2021.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
The Company's focus in recent years has been in the integration of LEDs into most commonly used lighting products for today's home. The LED lighting market is now mainstream and opportunities for growth have been minimized.  Further impacting the category were the tariff penalties resulting from the trade dispute between U.S. and China making products less competitive.
 
The Company’s looking forward strategy requires continued expansion of its product development and engineering, manufacturing base marketing and distribution of a broadened portfolio of consumer electronic products. The Company will pursue new revenue opportunities through the introduction and expansion of its “Connected Surfaces” portfolio into alternate distribution channels including e-commerce and others that the Company has not previously focused on.  The Company also intends to leverage its existing valuable customer base and strong relationships to achieve organic growth initiatives within this new category.
 
Capstone’s success has been in its ability to identify emerging product categories where Capstone’s management experience can be fully leveraged. We demonstrated this when the Company entered the LED lighting category.  Our branding and product strategies delivered the Company to a well-respected market position.  The Company’s low-cost manufacturing and operations have provided an advantage in delivering great products affordably.
 
Our expectation is that the new portfolio advancing in 2021 appeals to a much larger audience than our traditional LED lighting product line.  The new Connected Surfaces portfolio is designed to tap into consumer’s ever-expanding connected lifestyles prevalent today. The products have both touch screen and voice interfacing, internet access and an operating system capable of running downloadable applications. The average selling prices will be comparable to that of tablets and smartphones, expected retails to start at $699.00, with the goal to deliver exceptional consumer value to mainstream America.  Whereas, during the day your smartphone/tablet keeps you connected, whether it is work or personal, now when entering your home, Capstone’s new Connected Surfaces products will enable users the same level of connectivity in a more relaxed manner that does not require being tethered to these devices.

The Company competes in competitive consumer market channels that can be affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors such as, consumer confidence, employment levels, credit availability and commodity costs. Demand for the Company’s products is highly dependent on economic drivers such as consumer spending and discretionary income.
 
By working diligently overseas with alternate manufacturers located in Thailand, we anticipate minimal impact to our selling prices and related margins of profit that could otherwise be impacted by ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China. Although the overseas factories are fully functioning at this time, a resurgence of the global COVID-19 pandemic could impact the overseas factories again and could delay shipments of products from Thailand and China, which produces all of our products. The Company’s new factory in Thailand has produced and shipped orders in 2020. This facility will provide the Company with more flexibility in determining which location should produce goods for future orders. With the United States now being impacted by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic we believe the impact of the virus in the U.S. will continue until the mid-half of 2021, but this disruption has not impacted our long-term strategy and initiatives as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K report.
 
During 2020, the Company has expanded its investment and commitment in Social Media marketing.  With our Company’s plan to shift its focus to on-line commerce in the first half of 2021, its Social Media presence will be key to the Company’s growth initiatives.  The analytics derived from testing various messaging on social media platforms (i.e., Facebook Ads, Google Ads) has validated consumer interest in the Smart Mirror program.
 
Organic Growth Strategy
 
The Company intends to pursue various initiatives to execute its organic growth strategy, which is designed to enhance its market presence, expand its customer base and maintain its recognition as an industry leader in new product development.  Key elements of our organic growth strategy include:
 
Connected Surfaces.  Historically LED lighting products have been our core business. The Capstone Lighting and Hoover® Home LED brands combined, have sold millions of LED lighting products over the recent years and consequently the Company holds a well-respected position in the retail lighting category. While consistently launching successful lighting programs, the Company has determined that it needs to diversify and expand its core focus in order to continue to meet revenue growth initiatives.  The Company has refocused its development and marketing initiatives and is determined to build on its success with a broader product portfolio beyond lighting products only.  The new category “Connected Surfaces” was officially launched in January 2020 at CES. The Company intends to expand the new line of “Connected Products” for the next several years.  The Company’s product roadmap outlines plans for product introductions through 2022 and this will continue to expand as consumer product acceptance validates its innovations.  The Company believes this program will leverage existing relationships with its current retail partners, deliver on its e-commerce initiatives and collectively contribute organic growth for the Company.
 
The Company acknowledges that smart homes will become more mainstream over the next several years and will present significant growth opportunities for the Company and its Connected Surfaces portfolio.
 
While our focus of Connected Surface products is the smart home market, smart mirrors are being employed by retailers like Ralph Lauren and Neiman Marcus to allow customers to compare outfits on fitting room smart mirrors.  Further, single application smart mirrors are emerging in the fitness industry for interactive workouts at home as a result of the global pandemic.
 
The automobile segment leads the Smart Mirror industry as technology has imbedded into automobile mirrors.  As of the date of this Form 10-K Annual Report, the Company’s Connected Surfaces products target the smart home segment.
 
Perceived or Essential Strengths
 
Capstone believes that the following competitive strengths serve to support its business strategies.
 
  10
 

 

In North America, the Company has been recognized for more than a decade as an innovator and highly efficient, low-cost manufacturer in several product niches.  Capstone believes that its insight into the needs of retail programming and its proven execution track record with noted retailers globally positions it well for future growth.
 
Capstone's core executive team has been working together for over three decades and has successfully built and managed other consumer product companies.
 
Operating Management's experience in hardline product manufacturing has prepared the Company for successful entries into various consumer product markets.
 
Capstone's branding strategy was focused on establishing multiple trusted brands through licensing allowing for a broader reach into various channels. Capstone Lighting® (2008), Hoover® Home LED (2015) and Duracell® (2017) have contributed to expanding the Company's retail position.  Moreover, the knowledge of negotiating and managing such programs may prove beneficial for the Connected Surfaces portfolio.
 
Product Quality:  Through a combination of sourcing quality components, stringent manufacturing quality control and conducting rigorous third-party testing, product experiences by consumers are of the highest ranking. To deliver cost-competitive products without compromising quality standards, we leverage purchasing volume and capitalize on strategic vendor relationships.
Perceived Weaknesses
 
Capstone believes that its competitive weaknesses are:
 
It does not possess the business, marketing, and financial resources of larger competitors or the brand recognition or international markets of some of the larger competitors.
 
The Company’s current products lines are focused on consumer LED lighting and long-term revenue prospects of the recent diversification into Connected Surfaces products is uncertain as of the date of this Form 10-K report.  As a mature product line, LED business is a declining business line and revenue source.
 
The Company does not have the large internal research and development capability of its larger competitors.
 
Capstone operates with a limited number of employees whose functions are dedicated to executive management, sales and marketing or administrative support.  The limited number of employees may hinder or delay the ability of the Company to identify or respond to consumer preferences or new technology developments in a product line. Hiring may be required with any growth and qualified personnel may not be readily available.  We cannot match the compensation packages to prospective employees that many larger competitors may offer.
 
The Company relies on OEM's located in Thailand and China, which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of the continuing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain as of the date of this Form 10-K report.
 
Capstone’s international purchases can become more expensive if the U.S. Dollar weakens against the foreign currencies.
 
Should the increased U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese manufactured goods remain it may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products at retail.
 
While we have established new production capacity in Thailand, there is no final resolution of the U.S. / China trade dispute from which specific components are sourced.  Developing a new, efficient  OEM relationship in a new country takes time and effort to reach acceptable production efficiencies. We have only a short operational experience with Thai OEM’s and cannot predict long term effectiveness of the relationship.
 
  11
 

 

If the COVID-19 pandemic were to continue, it could have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain operations by depressing consumer purchase of our products – whether online or in retail stores.  Withstanding continued losses could cause the Company to consider significant corporate transaction, including, without limitation, a possible merger and acquisition transaction or reorganization to protect the core operations from the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like many companies, the Company conducts periodic strategic reviews where the feasibility of significant corporate transactions are considered, including mergers, asset purchases or sales and diversification or change in business lines. The Company lacks the financial resources of larger companies to withstand adverse, significant and sustained changes in business and financial condition.  This vulnerability necessitates an ongoing consideration of alternatives to current operations.
 
Products and Customers
 
While the Company is expanding its product portfolio through the introduction of the Capstone Connected Surfaces program, it still maintains a select number of LED lighting products under the "Capstone Lighting®” brand at both Costco and Sam’s Wholesale Clubs and available through Amazon.
 
The product lines available as of the date of this 10-K report are as follows:
 
Connected Surfaces – Smart Mirrors
 Standard Rectangular
 Wardrobe/Fitness Mirror
 LED Puck Lights
 LED Undercabinet Light Bars
 LED Motion Sensor Lights
 Eco-i-Lites
 Wireless Remote-Control Outlets
 Wireless Remote-Controlled LED Accent Lights
 
The plan to expand the Company’s product portfolio through Connected Surfaces involves the inherent risk of increased operating and marketing costs without a corresponding increase in operational revenues and profits.  While the Company makes significant investments into the Connected Surfaces portfolio, it is reasonable to expect to post losses while building the market for a new category of products which were formally launched at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show but faced delays to the market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Expense categories including molds, prototyping, engineering, advertising, public relations, tradeshows and social media platforms will continue to be incurred for six to nine months before shipments and related revenues occur.
 
Over the past ten years, the Company has established product distribution relationships with numerous leading international, national and regional retailers, including but not limited to: Amazon, Costco Wholesale, Sam's Club-Walmart, the Container Store and Firefly Buys. These distribution channels may sell the Company's products through the internet as well as through retail storefronts and catalogs/mail order. The Company believes it has developed the scale, manufacturing efficiencies, and design expertise that serves as the foundation for aggressive pursuit of niche product opportunities in our largest consumer domestic and international markets. While Capstone has traditionally generated the majority of its sales in the U.S. market, urbanization, rising family incomes and increased living standards abroad have spurred a perceived demand for small consumer appliances internationally. To capture this market opportunity, the Company has continued its international sales by leveraging relationships with our existing global retailers and by strengthening our international product offerings. CIHK assists the Company in placing more products into foreign market channels as well. The Company sold Capstone brand products to markets outside the U.S., including Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. International sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $704 thousand or 25% of net revenue as compared to $1.2 million or 10% in fiscal 2019. The Company's performance depends on a number of assumptions and factors.  Critical to growth are the economic conditions in the markets that we serve, as well as success in the Company's initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features.  Efforts to expand into new international markets may be adversely impacted in the near term by COVID-19 pandemic.

The Company's products are subject to general economic conditions that impact discretionary consumer spending on non-essential items.  Such continued progress depends on a number of assumptions and factors, including ones mentioned in "Risk Factors" below.  Critical to growth are economic conditions in the markets that foster greater consumer spending as well as success in the Company's initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features.  The Company's ability to fund the pursuit of our goals remains a constant, significant factor.
 
The Company believes that it will provide retailers with a broader and more diversified portfolio of consumer products across product categories, which should add diversity to the Company's revenues and cash flows sources.  Within the selection of products offered, Capstone seeks to service the needs of a wide range of consumers by providing products to satisfy their different interests, preferences and budgets.  The Company believes in its ability to serve retailers with an array of branded products and quickly introduce new products to continue to allow Capstone to further penetrate its existing customer bases, while also attracting new customers. The Company's primary, perceived challenge is creating sustained consumer demand for its products in a growing number of markets and attaining sustained profitability, which challenge is complicated by the cost of new product development and costs of penetrating new markets. An extensive product line, especially new product line, increases the investment in product development and, as such, increases operating overhead.
 
With the Company's “Connected Surfaces” category, Capstone has developed a comprehensive product offering. Within the selection of products offered, Capstone seeks to service the needs of a wide range of consumers by providing products to satisfy their different interests, preferences and budgets.  The Company believes in its ability to sell direct to consumers with an array of innovative connected products and quickly introduce additional products to continue to allow Capstone to further penetrate this developing market.
 
Tariffs. The previous U.S. administration implemented certain tariffs that directly affected the Company's competitiveness.  While all companies in certain industries are affected equally, the appeal for these products to consumers was negatively impacted when retail prices increased due to higher duty rates.  The Company has seen promotional schedules cut back and retailers have requested pricing adjustments that would not be known to them in advance to products being shipped.  Capstone's business model insulates the Company from paying duties as its retail partners are the importers of record.  The obvious unknown is the final impact of tariffs to the landed costs.  Accordingly, retailers have demonstrated caution in their promotional planning schedules and will continue to do so until the administration has clarified its position enabling importers to calculate estimated landed costs.
 
Tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by the previous U.S. administration provoked trade and tariff retaliation by other countries. A "trade dispute" of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.  As of the date of this Report, the new U.S. administration is currently reviewing its future position on this issue and there has not been a resolution of the Chinese-American trade dispute.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our products are sold nationally and internationally through a direct sales force.  The sales force markets the Company's products through numerous retail locations worldwide, including larger retail warehouse clubs, hardware centers and e-commerce websites.  Our business model has been designed to support “direct import sales” made directly to the retail customer.  However, we also offer “domestic sales” programs which will be expanded in the future as a result of the Capstone Connected program becomes available.
Direct Import Sales. We currently ship finished products directly to our retail customer from Thailand and China.  The sales transaction and title of goods are completed by delivering products to the customers overseas shipping point.  The customer takes title of the goods at that point and is responsible for inbound ocean freight and import duties.  Direct import sales are made in larger quantities (generally container sized lots) to customers worldwide.
 
  13
 

 

Domestic Sales. The strategy of selling products from a U.S. domestic warehouse enables the Company to provide timely delivery and serve as a domestic supplier of imported goods. With this model the Company imports goods from overseas and is responsible for all related costs including ocean freight, insurance, customs clearance, duties, storage and distribution charges related to such products and therefore such sales command higher sales prices than direct sales. Domestic orders are for a much smaller size and could be as low as a single unit directly to the end consumer if ordered through an online website. To support an effective e-commerce business model, we will be required to warehouse adequate inventory levels enabling the Company to ship orders directly to the end consumer expediently.
 
We continue to make investments to expand our sales, marketing, technical applications support and distribution capabilities to sell our product portfolio.  We also continue to make investments to promote and build market awareness of the products and brands we offer. Our sales within the U.S. are primarily made by our in-house sales team and our independent sales agencies.  Our independent sales agencies are paid a commission based upon sales made in their respective territories.  Our sales agencies are recruited, trained and monitored by us directly. We will utilize an agency as needed to help us provide service to our retail customers as required.  The sales agency agreements are generally one (1) year agreements, which automatically renew on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party on 30 days’ prior notice. Our international sales to divisions of U.S. based retailers are made by our in-house sales team. Other international sales are made by our Hong-Kong based CIHK office staff.
 
The Company actively promotes its products to retailers and distributors at North American trade shows, such as the Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”) or the International Hardware Show, but also relies on the retail sales channels to advertise its products directly to the end user consumers through various promotional activities.
 
In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had two customers who comprised  approximately 89% of net revenue and two customers who comprised 98% of net revenues in 2019.  Although we have long established relationships with our customers, we do not have contractual arrangements to purchase a fixed quantity of product annually.  A decrease of business or a loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
For  sales growth in the retail market to continue, the Company is focused on expanding the product portfolio currently offered into new innovative electronic categories that will also allow the Company to expand into different retail departments and channels of distribution.
 
The Company has been focused on establishing an on-line e-commerce presence to support the introduction of the “Connected Surfaces” program and deliver direct to consumer.
 
During 2020, we have utilized social media platforms and online advertising campaigns to further grow the Company’s online presence. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn, Capstone has launched a You Tube channel to host Smart Mirror videos and established a Twitter account. The Company has a Social Media presence on the following Social Media platforms:

Competitive Conditions
 
 The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. The Company competes with large multinationals with global operations as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular categories.
 
Competition is influenced by technological innovation, brand perceptions, product quality, value perception, customer service and price. Over the past several years while the Company's focus has been on LED lighting, principal competitors include Energizer, Feit Electric and Jasco (GE). The Company believes private-label sales by large retailers has some impact on the market in some parts of the world as many national retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Target and Sam’s/Wal-Mart offer lighting as part of their private branded product lines.  Many of the Company's competitors have greater resources and capabilities, including greater brand recognition, research and development budgets and broader geographical market reach. Competitors with greater resources could undermine Capstone's expansion efforts by marketing campaigns targeting its expansion efforts or price competition.
  
Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.
  The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the decrease in consumer reliance on traditional brick-and-mortar retailing and heightened the importance of e-commerce and online marketing and sales. We have just started our Social Media marketing. Many competitors have more established, widespread and effective e-commerce and Social Media campaigns than we do. We may not be able to effectively compete in e-commerce and Social Media marketing and sales. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted marketing and sales of many products and the long-term impact of the pandemic remains uncertain as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K report.


With trends and technology continually evolving, Capstone will continue to invest and develop new products that are competitively priced with consumer centric features and benefits easily articulated to influence point of sale decision making. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, pricing, retailer support, responsiveness, and cost management. The Company continues to invest in developing the technologies and design critical to competing in our markets. Our ability to invest is limited by operational cash flow and funding from third parties, including members of management and the Board of Directors, and by ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance.
  
Subject to adequate and affordable funding, absence of unexpected competition or technological developments in connected surface devices, and a curbing of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company believes that it is equipped to compete effectively with its competition in all of these areas due to its proven track record in delivering innovation to the market and cost-effective and timely manner.
 
Research, Product Development, and Manufacturing Activities
 
The Company's research and development department based in Hong Kong designs and engineers many of the Company's products, with collaboration from its third-party manufacturing partners and software developers. The Company outsources the manufacture and assembly of our products to a number of contract manufacturers overseas. Our research and development focus includes efforts to:

• | develop product with increasing technology and functionality with enhanced quality and performance, and at a very competitive cost.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | solidify new manufacturing relationships with contract manufacturers in Thailand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CIHK establishes strict engineering specifications and product testing protocols with the Company's contract manufacturers and ensure that their factories adhere to all Regional Labor and Social Compliance Laws. These contract manufacturers purchase components that we specify and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture our products. We leverage the strength of the contract manufacturers and allocate the manufacturing of specific products to the contract manufacturer best suited to the task. Quality control and product testing is conducted at the contract manufacturers facility and at 3rd party testing laboratories overseas.

Capstone's research and development team enforces its proprietary manufacturing expertise by maintaining control over all outsourced production and critical production molds. To ensure the quality and consistency of the Company's products manufactured overseas, Capstone uses globally recognized certified testing laboratories such as United Laboratories (UL) or Intertek (ETL) to ensure all products are designed and tested to adhere to each country's individual regulatory standards. The Company also uses quality control inspectors who examine and test products to Capstone's specification(s) before shipments are released. CIHK office capabilities include product development, project management, sourcing management, supply chain logistics, factory compliance auditing, and quality enforcement for all supplier factories located in Hong Kong, China and Thailand.
 
To successfully implement Capstone's business strategy, the Company must continually improve its current products and develop new product segments with innovative imbedded technologies to meet consumer's growing expectations. The Connected Surfaces product development is our current effort to achieve those expectations.
 
Capstone will continue to invest in more technical and innovative product categories. These costs are expensed when incurred and are included in the operating expenses.
 
Raw Materials
 
The principal raw materials currently used by Capstone are sourced in Thailand and China, as the Company orders product exclusively through contract manufacturers in the region. These contract manufacturers purchase components based on the Company's specifications and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture the Company's products. Capstone allocates the production of specific products to the contract manufacturer the Company believes is more experienced to produce the specific product and whose facility is located in the country that most benefits from the U.S. Tariff regulations. To ensure the consistent quality of Capstone's products, quality control procedures have been incorporated at each stage of the manufacturing process, ranging from the inspection of raw materials through production and delivery to the customer. These procedures are additional to the manufacturers' internal quality control procedures and performed by Quality Assurance personnel.

• | Raw Materials – Components and supplies are subject to sample inspections upon arrival at the contract manufacturer, to ensure the correct specified components are being used in production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work in Process – Our quality control team conducts quality control tests at different points during the product stages of our manufacturing process to ensure that quality integrity is maintained.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finished Goods – Our team performs tests on finished and packaged products to assess product safety, integrity and package compliance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Raw materials used in manufacturing include plastic resin, copper, led bulbs, batteries, and corrugated paper. Prices of materials have remained competitive in the last year. CAPC believes that adequate supplies of raw materials required for its operations are available at the present time. CAPC, cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials. These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, CAPC has not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials. We believe we have extensive experience in manufacturing and have taken positions to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume. CIHK is responsible for developing and sourcing finished products from Asia in order to grow and diversify our product portfolio. Quality testing for these products is performed both by CIHK and by our globally recognized third party quality testing laboratories.
 
Section 1502 of Title XV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires SEC-reporting companies to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product. Based on our inquiries to our manufacturers, we do not believe as of the date of such inquiries that any conflict minerals are used in making our products.

Distribution and Fulfillment
 
Since January 2015, the Company has transferred its U.S. domestic warehousing and distribution needs to a third-party warehousing facility situated in Anaheim, California.  The warehouse operator provides full inventory storage, packaging and logistics services including direct to store and direct to consumer shipping capabilities that electronically interface to our existing operations software.  The warehouse operator provides full ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), Inventory Control and Warehouse Management Systems.  These fulfillment services can be expanded to the east coast in Charleston, South Carolina, if the Company needed to establish an east coast distribution point.  This relationship, if required, will allow us to fully expand our U.S. distribution capabilities and services.
 
As the Company transitions into the e-commerce and direct to consumer marketplace, the Company has developed a new website with full shopping cart capabilities.  To complete this project the Company has negotiated contracts for secured credit card processing capability, state sales tax compliance services and order fulfillment and logistics services, at a very competitive rate.  The Company is also planning to warehouse and supply its Smart Mirror program through Amazon fulfilment.
 
Royalties
 
We have, from time to time, entered into agreements whereby we have agreed to pay royalties for the use of nationally recognized licensed brands on Company product offerings. Royalty expense incurred under such agreements is expensed at the time of shipment.
 
In 2019 the Company’s marketing objective was to transition existing licensed lighting product lines into the Capstone Lighting brand, which was successfully achieved.
 
On February 3, 2020, the remaining Royalty license expired as the Company did not achieve the stated net sales volumes for the renewal period.
 
Seasonality
 
In general, sales for household products and electronics are seasonally influenced. Certain gift products cause consumers to increase purchases during key holiday winter season of the fourth quarter, which requires increases in retailer inventories during the third quarter. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes can create conditions that drive increased needs for portable power and power failure light sales. Climate change may increase the number and severity of hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding. Historically, the lighting products had lower sales during the first quarter due to the Chinese New Year holiday as factories are closed and shipments are halted during this period. Our transition to Thailand manufacturers may reduce the impact of Chinese New Year holiday.
 
We do not have sufficient operational experience with Connected Surfaces to predict the seasonality of connected surfaces.

Intellectual Property
 
CAPC subsidiary, CAPI, has filed a number of U.S. trademarks and patents over the past decade. These include the following trademarks: Exclusive license and sub-license to Power Failure Technology; Capstone Power Control, Timely Reader, Pathway Lights, and 10 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 5 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED - Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, 3 LED Slim Line Eco-i-Lite Power Failure Light, LED Induction Charged Headlight. We also have a number of patents pending; Puck Light (cookie), Puck Light Base, Multi-Color Puck Lights, LED Dual Mode Solar Light, Integrated Light Bulb (Coach Light), LED Gooseneck Lantern, Spotlights, Security Motion Activated Lights, Under Cabinet Lighting and Bathroom Vanity Light. CAPC periodically prepares patent and trademark applications for filing in the United States and China. CAPC will also pursue foreign patent protection in foreign countries if deemed necessary to protect a patent and to the extent that we have the available cash to do so. CAPC's ability to compete effectively in the Home Lighting categories depends in part, on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing agreements. CAPC owns a number of patents, trademarks, trademark and patent applications and other technology which CAPC believes are significant to its business. These intellectual property rights relate primarily to lighting device improvements and manufacturing processes.
 
While the Company may license third party technologies for its products, or may rely on other companies, especially OEM’s, for design, engineering and testing, the Company believes that its oversight of design and function of its products and its marketing capabilities are significant factors in the ability of the Company to sell its products.
 
Value of Patents
 
The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. The validity and breadth of claims in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.
 
Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure shareholders that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us.  We will assess any loss of these rights and determine whether to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights on a case by case basis.
 
We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted.  There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others to support new product introductions.  There can be no assurance that we
 can acquire licenses under patents belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us and there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available to us, if at all, on terms acceptable to us.  Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent issued to or licensed by us will not be infringed or circumvented by others or will not be successfully challenged by others in lawsuits.  We do not have a reserve for litigation costs associated with intellectual property matters.  The cost of litigating intellectual property rights claims may be beyond our financial ability to fund.
 
As is customary in the retail industry, many of our customer agreements requires us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims. Such claims could harm our relationships with customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages and expend significant Company resources to defend against the claim and or seek a license.

Information Technology
 
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems to manage our daily operations, communicate with our customers and maintain our financial and accounting records. In the normal course of business, we receive information regarding customers, associates, and vendors.  Since we do not collect significant amounts of valuable personal data or sensitive business data from others, our internal computer systems are under a light to moderate level of risk from hackers or other individuals with malicious intent to gain unauthorized access to our computer systems. Cyberattacks are growing in number and sophistication and are an ongoing threat to business computer systems, which are used to operate the business on a day to day basis. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, or other events. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain our information or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our systems or an event resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or degradation of services provided by critical business systems, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors, results of operations, product development and make us unable or limit our ability to respond to customers' demands.
 
As shown by hacking of major commercial and government computer systems and networks, no system that is connected is completely safe from hacking or malware. We have incorporated into our data network various on and off site data backup processes which should allow us to mitigate any data loss events, however our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
 

• | hurricanes, fire, flood and other natural disasters
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | power outage
--+-------------


• | internet, telecommunications or data network failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Regulations
 
We believe that the Company is in compliance with environmental protection regulations and will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
Employees
 
 Response to COVID-19
 
 The Company’s top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have adjusted standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure the continued safety of our employees and we continually monitor evolving health guidelines to ensure ongoing compliance and protection of our employees. These procedures include expanded and more frequent cleaning within facilities, implementation of appropriate social distancing programs, requiring use of certain personal protective equipment, screening protocols and work from home programs.
 
The Company will continue to evolve these programs to protect the health and safety of our employees.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 8 employees in our U.S. office and 3 employees in our Hong Kong operation.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We have no part-time workers.  We believe that our staff is adequate to handle the current operations, but we recognize that the new product line and social media marketing will probably require additional personnel – either employees or contractors in 2021-2022.  Our ability to hire additional personnel is subject to adequate revenue flow and funding.

Corporate Information
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 431 Fairway Drive, Suite #200, Deerfield Beach, Florida, USA 33441. Our telephone number is (954)570-8889 and our website is at URL: www.capstonecompaniesinc.com. Our U.S. subsidiaries operate out of our principal executive offices. The Company believes that its current facilities are adequate for conduct of its business.
 
We file our financial information and other materials required under the Exchange Act electronically with the SEC.  These materials can be accessed electronically via the Internet at www.sec.gov.  Such materials and other information about the Company are also available through our corporate website : https://www.capstonecompanies.com.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to regulation by federal and state securities authorities as well as various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations governing a consumer products company and a for-profit business.  We are not subject to any U.S. federal, state or local regulation that poses, in our opinion, any special or unusual burden or obstacle to conducting our business and financial affairs.  Our main concern, although greatly diminished in terms of government regulation is the changing regulatory environment in China and its impact on our ability to access our LED lighting product manufacturing sources and obtain our specific consumer products.  While the general trend in China has to be conducive to trade and commerce, China is a still a single-party nation-state in which the central government has the power to dramatically and immediately change its trade and commercial policies and laws.  Political or military conflict between the United States and China, who are rivals for power and influence in Asia and to an increasing extent all along the Pacific Rim as well as being diametrically opposed to one another over the status of Taiwan, could provoke a change in Chinese trade or commercial law that makes it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain consumer products.  Such a development would have a serious impact on our ability to compete in the United States in the niche LED consumer product market.
 
CIHK is subject to the laws of Hong Kong SAR, which is a part of and subject to governance by China.  In light of the specific operational role of CIHK in our company, we do not believe that such regulation poses a significant risk factor in terms of the business and financial condition of the Company.
 
Working Capital Requirements and Financing
 
In order to successfully launch the online Smart Mirror business, the Company will be required to maintain sufficient on hand available inventory levels, to allow for immediate fulfilment of an online order. This will require additional investment in on hand domestic  inventory and require an efficient logistics system that will provide for inventory staged throughout the supply chain to provide for efficient inventory replenishment to support forecasted sales. The Company, as needed, will strategically increase its inventory levels held at its designated fulfilment centers. Combined with investment in new product expansion, new product molds, product testing and outside certifications, package design work, and further expansion of its capabilities in Thailand, the Company may require additional working capital to fund these strategic projects.

On July 31, 2020, the Company terminated its factoring agreement with Sterling National Bank. The Company has been in discussions with alternate funding sources that offer extensive programs that are more in line with the Company’s future business model, particularly a facility that provides funding options that are suitable for the e-commerce business that the Company is transitioning into. The borrowing costs associated with such financing are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating. We cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate competitive rates, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future.
 
On January 4, 2021, the Company entered a $750,000 working capital loan agreement with Directors, Stewart Wallach and Jeffrey Postal. The term of the loan started January 4, 2021 and ends June 30, 2021 (“Initial Period’). The Company may extend the Initial Period for an additional six consecutive months, ending December 31, 2021, under the same terms and conditions as the Initial Period, by providing written notice of the election to extend to the lenders prior to the expiration of the Initial Period. The Company may borrow and reborrow under the agreement up to $750,000 and prepay wholly or partially the unpaid principal amount at any time and do so without pre-pay penalty or charge. The unpaid principal amount and all accrued interest is due and payable in full at the end of the Initial Period or expiration of the extended date, being December 31, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”), in a single lump sum balloon payment.
 
The Company's ability to maintain sufficient working capital is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results.  Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's working capital, ability to obtain financing, and its operations in the future.  However, achieving expected results as accomplished in 2017 and 2016, increased working capital and provided the Company with liquidity to transition into a new innovative category without creating debt.
 
In addition, we intend to seek alternative sources of liquidity, including but not limited to accessing the capital markets, or other alternative financing measures. However, instability in, or tightening of the capital markets, could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. An economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and financial performance may also affect the Company’s ability to obtain funding.
 
As of  December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $0 debt outstanding.
 
The Company's liquidity and cash requirements are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
