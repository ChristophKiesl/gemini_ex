Item 1. Business
GENERAL
 DESC, a public utility headquartered in Cayce, South Carolina, is a South Carolina corporation organized in 1924. DESC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCANA, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy. DESC conducts business under the name “Dominion Energy South Carolina.” At December 31, 2021, DESC had approximately 2,400 employees, of which approximately 720 were subject to collective bargaining agreements.
 DESC is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to approximately 772,000 customers in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. Additionally, DESC distributes natural gas to approximately 419,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina. DESC’s business experiences seasonal fluctuations, with generally higher sales of electricity during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and generally higher sales of natural gas during the winter months due to heating requirements. 
 GENCO owns a coal-fired electric generating station with a 605 MW net generating capacity (summer rating). GENCO’s electricity is sold exclusively to DESC, pursuant to a FERC-approved power purchase agreement and related operating agreement. The effects of these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for DESC's nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels and emission and other environmental allowances.
 COMPETITION
 There is no competition for electric distribution or generation service within DESC's retail electric service territory in South Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. However, competition from third-party owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in DESC’s service territory is permitted pursuant to Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission infrastructure in DESC’s service area in the future.
 Competition in DESC’s natural gas distribution operations is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and the ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers.
 REGULATION
 DESC’s electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission. DESC’s electric generation operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission, FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE and various other federal, state and local authorities. DESC’s electric transmission service is primarily regulated by FERC and the DOE. DESC’s gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission, as well as PHMSA, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the ORS for enforcement of federal and state pipeline safety requirements in its service territories.
Electric Regulation in South Carolina
 DESC’s retail electric base rates in South Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to South Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the South Carolina Commission. South Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows DESC to recover its operating costs and a return on invested capital. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the South Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease DESC’s future earnings. Additionally, if the South Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, DESC’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel costs are reviewed annually by the South Carolina Commission, as required by statute, and fuel rates are subject to revision in these annual fuel proceedings. DESC also submits annual filings to the South Carolina Commission for rider recovery related to its DSM program and pension costs. The DSM rider includes recovery of any net lost revenues and for a shared savings incentive.
 
Pursuant to the SCANA Merger Approval Order, DESC is recovering capital costs and a return on capital cost rate base related to the NND Project over a 20-year period through a capital cost rider. The capital cost rider also provides for the return to retail electric customers of certain amounts associated with the NND Project. Revenue from the capital cost rider component of retail electric rates will continue to decline over the 20-year period as capital cost rate base is reduced.
 
Gas Regulation in South Carolina
 DESC is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its natural gas distribution service by the South Carolina Commission. DESC provides retail natural gas service to customers in areas in which it has received authorization from the South Carolina Commission and in municipalities in which it holds a franchise. DESC’s base rates can be adjusted annually, pursuant to the RSA, for recovery of costs related to natural gas infrastructure. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class approved by the 
 5

South Carolina Commission in the latest general rate case. Base rates for DESC are based primarily on a rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. DESC also utilizes a weather normalization adjustment to adjust its base rates during the winter billing months for residential and commercial customers to mitigate the effects of unusually cold or warm weather.
 
DESC’s natural gas tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment that provides for the recovery of prudently incurred gas costs, including transportation costs. DESC is authorized to adjust its purchased gas rates monthly and makes routine filings with the South Carolina Commission to provide notification of changes in these rates. Costs that are under or over recovered are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, and considered in subsequent purchased gas adjustments. The purchased gas adjustment filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Increases or decreases in purchased gas costs can result in corresponding changes in purchased gas adjustment rates and the revenue generated by those rates. The South Carolina Commission reviews DESC’s gas purchasing policies and practices, including its administration of the purchased gas adjustment, annually.
 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 Under the Federal Power Act, FERC regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. DESC may make wholesale sales at market-based rates outside its balancing authority pursuant to its market-based sales tariff authorized by FERC.  In addition, DESC has FERC approved tariffs to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its respective embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be used to sell to loads within or outside DESC’s service territory. Any such sales are voluntary. 
 DESC is subject to FERC’s Standards of Conduct that govern conduct between transmission function employees of interstate gas and electric transmission providers and the marketing function employees of its affiliates. The rule defines the scope of transmission and marketing-related functions that are covered by the standards and is designed to prevent transmission providers from giving affiliates undue preferences. 
 DESC is also subject to FERC’s affiliate restrictions that (1) prohibit power sales between nonregulated plants and utility plants without first receiving FERC authorization, (2) require the nonregulated and utility plants to conduct their wholesale power sales operations separately, and (3) prohibit utilities from sharing market information with nonregulated plant operating personnel. The rules are designed to prohibit utilities from giving the nonregulated plants a competitive advantage. 
 EPACT included provisions to create an Electric Reliability Organization, which is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC has certified NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards will be subject to fines of up to $1.4 million per day, per violation and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation. 
 In October 2011, FERC issued an order approving the settlement of DESC’s formula rate that updates transmission rates on an annual basis, including its ROE. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for the calendar year and is updated annually based on actual costs.  This FERC accepted formula rate enables DESC to earn a return on its investment in electric transmission infrastructure.
 In February 2021, DESC and the other members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market submitted the Southeast Energy Exchange Market Agreement to FERC for authorization. This agreement sets forth the framework and rules for establishing and maintaining a new electronic trading platform designed to enhance the existing bilateral market in the Southeast utilizing zero-charge transmission service. That transmission service, in turn, will be voluntarily provided by participating transmission service providers, including DESC. In October 2021, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market Agreement became effective by operation of law as a result of a split FERC vote. The members expect the Southeast Energy Exchange Market platform to be operational in the third quarter of 2022.
