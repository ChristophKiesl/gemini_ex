Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to transform the lives of patients with rare hematologic diseases and cancers. Our drug discovery expertise has generated a pipeline of product candidates focused on indications with significant unmet patient need. Our pipeline consists of six product candidates, two of which we are pursuing as product candidates for development, FT-4202 for the treatment of sickle cell disease, or SCD, and other hemoglobinopathies, and FT-7051 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. 
 Our lead product candidate, FT-4202, is a novel, oral, once-daily, potentially disease-modifying therapy initially being studied for the treatment of SCD. SCD, one of the most common single-gene disorders in the world, is a chronic hemolytic anemia that affects hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in red blood cells, or RBCs, that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. SCD is often characterized by low hemoglobin levels, painful vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs, progressive multi-organ damage and early death. FT-4202 is a potent activator of pyruvate kinase-R, or PKR, designed to improve RBC metabolism, function and survival, and potentially resulting in both increased hemoglobin levels and reduced VOCs. We are evaluating FT-4202 in a multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase I trial in SCD patients ages 12 years and older. We completed the healthy volunteer portion of the trial in May 2019 and presented data at the 2019 American Society of Hematology meeting demonstrating the tolerability and proof of mechanism of FT-4202 in healthy volunteers. We reported data from a single dose cohort in seven SCD patients in June 2020. In the single dose cohort in SCD patients, we observed a favorable tolerability profile and favorable biologic effects with evidence of pharmacodynamic activity translating into increased oxygen affinity, a shift in the Point of Sickling to lower oxygen tensions, improved membrane deformability of sickle RBCs and an increased hemoglobin and RBC level at 24 hours post dose. We reported data from the first multiple daily dose, or MAD 1, cohort of nine SCD patients in December 2020. Data from the second multiple ascending dose, or MAD 2 cohort was reported in the first quarter of 2021, and initial results from a 12-week open label extension in SCD patients are expected to be reported in the second quarter of 2021. Based on the results from the ongoing Phase I trial, we opened a global pivotal Phase II/III trial in SCD in late 2020 and began enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2021. We have received Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for FT-4202 in SCD patients. The European Medicines Agency has granted Orphan Drug designation to FT-4202 for the treatment of SCD. 
 Our product candidate, FT-7051, is a potent and selective inhibitor of CREB-binding protein/E1A binding protein p300, or CBP/p300, in clinical development for the treatment of mCRPC. Prostate cancer is reported as the second and third leading cause of cancer death for men in the U.S. and in Europe, respectively, and mCRPC is the most advanced form of the disease. Prostate cancer cell growth is driven by activity of the androgen receptor, or AR, and primary treatments of mCRPC currently include therapies, such as Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) and Xtandi (enzalutamide), that reduce androgen synthesis or inhibit androgen binding and activation of the AR.  Virtually all patients who demonstrate initial clinical responses eventually acquire resistance to these agents. Studies have shown that approximately 20% to 40% of mCRPC patients who develop resistance express an AR splice variant called AR-v7, that is associated with substantially shorter overall survival. There are currently no approved therapies specifically aimed at mCRPC having AR resistance variants, including AR-v7 splice variant. Multiple third-party studies have demonstrated that CBP/p300 is a co-activator of the AR, and, therefore, we believe that inhibiting CBP/p300 may play an important role in the suppression of mCRPC that is driven by AR-resistant molecular alterations. The FDA cleared our investigational new drug application, or IND, for FT-7051 in April 2020, and we dosed the first patient in our Phase I trial in mCRPC patients in January 2021. Initial results from this Phase I trial are expected in the second half of 2021, which may include safety/tolerability, PK/PD, and preliminary biomarker data, and clinical activity results are anticipated in 2022. 
 We are pursuing partnerships for our other compounds, olutasidenib, a selective inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, or mIDH1, and FT-8225, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, or FASN. IDH1 mutations have been shown to be oncogenic for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and glioma. We have successfully completed a registrational Phase II trial for relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or R/R AML, that reported positive interim results in October 2020, and are preparing a new drug application, or NDA for submission to the FDA. We are also completing an exploratory Phase I clinical trial for glioma, from which 
 1


we reported results at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in 2020 demonstrating disease control in a significant proportion of patients. 
 
FASN is an enzyme responsible for fatty acid production in the liver and other organs. Excessive liver fat is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We have developed FT-8225, a liver-targeted FASN inhibitor for possible treatment of NASH, for which preclinical studies have been completed that we believe will support an IND filing. Additionally, we have licensed exclusively two programs each to Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, and Celgene Corporation, now Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, based on molecules that we discovered. Under these out-licensed programs we are eligible to receive, subject to the achievement of certain clinical and commercial milestones, aggregate payments in excess of $500 million plus royalties over time. Pursuant to our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we have recently achieved the initial Phase I clinical milestone for BI1701963, the first pan-KRAS:SOS1 inhibitor to be tested clinically. 
 Sickle Cell Disease 
 SCD is one of the most common single-gene disorders, affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and approximately 30,000 individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, or collectively the EU 5. Reporting limitations complicate stating an exact number, but the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, reports that prevalence is estimated at over 20 million individuals globally. Despite available treatment options, most patients with SCD still suffer from lifelong disability, significant morbidity, reduced quality of life and an average reduction of life expectancy by 25 to 30 years. Due to its chronic nature, the economic burden of SCD is high, both in terms of direct costs for lifelong management, hospitalizations and treatment of associated morbidities, and indirect costs of lost lifetime earnings and reduced productivity of both patients and caregivers. Longitudinal estimates suggest that on a per patient basis, cumulative lifetime healthcare costs for this population in the U.S. could exceed approximately $9 million, assuming the patient lives until approximately age 50, excluding costs associated with productivity loss and reduced quality of life. 
 SCD is the most common type of hemoglobinopathy, a diverse range of rare inherited genetic disorders that affect hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in RBCs responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. In SCD, a structural abnormality in hemoglobin results in RBCs with a sickle-shaped deformation after off-loading oxygen to tissues. These sickle RBCs can aggregate in tissue blood vessels and block blood flow and oxygen delivery to organs, which can lead to acute and painful VOC events that result in tissue ischemia, infarction, and long-term tissue damage. In addition, sickle RBCs tend to be fragile due to sickling and can have a life span of 10 to 20 days versus normal RBCs, which have a life span of 90 to approximately 120 days. This fragility leads to hemolysis, or the destruction of sickle RBCs, and chronic anemia, or reduced levels of RBCs and total hemoglobin. Additionally, lysed RBCs release factors that are detrimental to the vascular endothelium and can induce an inflammatory response that contributes to vaso-occlusion and underlies large-vessel stroke and pulmonary arterial hypertension. On average, adult SCD patients are hospitalized 1.5 times per year and have significant morbidity and increased mortality. 
 We believe that the current therapeutic treatment of SCD is inadequate. Despite available treatment options, most patients with SCD still suffer from lifelong disability, significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and an average reduction of life expectancy by 25 to 30 years. Acute painful VOC events are common, occurring on approximately 55% of days, as self-reported in SCD patients. Supportive care for the management of painful VOCs entails the use of opioids, which are effective at managing pain but are highly addictive. For most patients treatment involves the chronic use of hydroxyurea, or HU, an oral chemotherapy, which stimulates production of fetal hemoglobin, or HbF, and reduces sickle hemoglobin, or HbS, polymerization and consequent RBC sickling. While inducing HbF can be effective therapeutically, HU can suppress bone marrow function and cause birth defects. Although HU is considered to have an acceptable therapeutic index given the consequences of SCD, HU is underutilized due to safety concerns and side effects. 
 In November 2019, the FDA approved Oxbryta (voxelotor) and Adakveo (crizanlizumab) for the treatment of SCD. Voxelotor is an oral small molecule therapy, which demonstrated improvement in total hemoglobin levels but failed to significantly decrease VOCs. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody therapy that has shown benefit in reducing the number of VOCs. However, crizanlizumab does not treat the underlying cause of SCD and is only administered through intravenous administration. 
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, is also an option for SCD patients, but this therapy is limited by toxic preconditioning regimens involving chemotherapy ablation, donor availability, and the need for post-
 2


transplant immunosuppression. Gene-based therapy is an innovative and potentially curative approach to SCD; however, it is an invasive, high-risk procedure that also requires toxic preconditioning of the bone marrow. We believe that these factors, in addition to the expected relatively high cost for treatment, may limit the use of gene therapy. 
 Our Solution: FT-4202 
 Our lead product candidate, FT-4202, is a novel, oral, once-daily, potentially disease-modifying therapy initially being studied for the treatment of SCD. Unlike other emerging SCD therapies, we have designed FT-4202 to modulate RBC metabolism by impacting two critical metabolites through PKR activation: a decrease in 2,3 diphosphoglycerate, or 2,3-DPG, which increases oxygen affinity and may reduce sickling, and an increase in adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which may improve RBC and membrane health. We believe that this multi-modal approach may improve hemoglobin levels through increased RBC survival and decrease VOCs . If successful, we believe that FT-4202 has the potential to become the foundational standard of care for SCD patients by modifying the disease at an early stage and potentially preventing end-organ damage, reducing hospitalizations, and improving the patients’ overall health and quality of life. 
 Early studies and trials with FT-4202 show several potential points of differentiation from other drugs on the market or in development for SCD, in that FT-4202: 
  
• | Modulates RBC metabolism via a multi-modal approach by decreasing 2,3-DPG and increasing ATP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Will be administered orally once daily;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Is well-tolerated in clinical trials and has not shown evidence of inhibition of aromatase, an enzyme involved in converting testosterone to estrogen, which may permit dosing in a broad range of patients, including both pediatric and adult populations, as it does not lead to alterations in the hormones that affect pediatric growth and development; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shows a lack of cytochrome P450, or CYP, inhibition or induction, thereby reducing risk for inducing its own metabolism or creating undesirable drug-drug interactions due to CYP metabolism of other drugs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are currently evaluating FT-4202 in a multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase I trial in SCD patients ages 12 years and older. We completed the healthy volunteer portion of the trial and presented data at the 2019 ASH meeting demonstrating the tolerability and proof of mechanism of FT-4202 in healthy volunteers. In RBCs of the healthy volunteers, FT-4202 demonstrated a reduction in 2,3-DPG and an increase in ATP, which we believe provides confirmatory evidence of PKR activation in healthy RBCs. In addition, the reduction of 2,3-DPG correlated with increased oxygen affinity with single and multiple doses of FT-4202. We reported data from a single dose cohort in seven SCD patients in June 2020. The early single dose studies in SCD patients show that FT-4202 was well-tolerated and has favorable biologic effects with evidence of pharmacodynamic activity translating into increased oxygen affinity, a shift in the Point of Sickling to lower oxygen tensions, improved membrane deformability of sickle RBCs and an increased hemoglobin and RBC level at 24 hours post dose. We reported data from the first nine patients from the MAD 1 cohort at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting in December 2020. In the cohort of SCD patients receiving a 300 mg dose of FT-4202 for 14 days, six of seven patients (86%) on FT-4202 achieved a hemoglobin increase greater than 1 g/dL from baseline with once-daily dosing for 14 days. An observed median reduction of 60% in reticulocyte count as well as median reductions of 36% and 35% in hemolytic markers such as LDH and bilirubin, respectively, which is consistent with the hypothesis that FT-4202 improves RBC survival and reduces RBC turnover. Data was also presented utilizing Oxygen scan and Osmoscan showing that red blood cell flexibility (deformability) was increased and that cells were better able to normalize the hydration stress of high extracellular salt concentrations. A favorable tolerability profile was also observed after dosing FT-4202 for 14 days in patients with SCD. Based on the results of the ongoing Phase I trial, we opened a global pivotal Phase II/III trial in SCD in late 2020 and began enrolling patients in the first quarter of 2020. We have received Fast Track, Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA for FT-4202 in SCD patients. The European Medicines Agency also granted Orphan Drug designation to FT-4202 for the treatment of SCD. 
 We also plan to develop FT-4202 to treat thalassemia, which is a hemoglobinopathy that results from decreased or absent production of the alpha or beta-subunit of hemoglobin, thereby producing RBCs that have less oxygen carrying capacity than normal RBCs. We expect to initiate a trial of FT-4202 in patients with alpha or beta thalassemia in the second half of 2021. A planned trial in pediatric patients with SCD is expected to be 
 3


initiated in 2022. We are also exploring the potential for broader utility of the PKR mechanism in additional hemoglobinopathies and other potential diseases.  
 Prostate Cancer 
 In the United States, prostate cancer is projected to claim approximately 33,000 lives in 2020 and is the second leading cause of cancer death for men. The incidence of prostate cancer has been estimated to reach approximately 192,000 and 365,000 patients in the United States and Europe, respectively. Such deaths are typically the result of the most advanced form of prostate cancer, mCRPC. 
 Androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, activate AR-dependent gene transcription, which drives growth of prostate cancer cells. Accordingly, therapies designed to abrogate testicular androgen production, akin to castration, have become a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment. However, prostate cancer cells can become castration-resistant by several mechanisms, including: (i) mutation of the AR to allow for activation by non-androgen steroids, such as corticosteroids, estrogen and progesterone, (ii) amplification of the AR that enables cancer cells to thrive on the low levels of androgens made by the adrenal gland, (iii) overexpression of co-activator proteins, including CBP/p300, that enhance AR induced transcriptional activity, (iv) intra-tumoral androgen synthesis, (v) upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor, and (vi) an increase in splice variants, such as AR-v7, that are always active even in the absence of androgen binding. Abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of adrenal steroid hormone biosynthesis, and enzalutamide and Erleada (apalutamide), AR inhibitors, are all approved therapies for mCRPC that address some but not all these resistance mechanisms. 
 Although current cancer therapies may improve overall survival, or OS, prostate cancer cells can develop resistance to these therapies through mutation of the AR. Patients whose prostate cancer cells express the AR-v7 resistance variant, which enables the AR to be active even in the absence of androgen binding, generally have a poor prognosis. Data suggest that treatment with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or apalutamide may induce prostate cancer cells to express the AR-v7 variant. According to a Journal of Clinical Oncology publication, AR-v7 positive mCRPC patients have a median OS rate of 10.8 months whereas AR-v7 negative patients in the same trial had an OS rate of 27.2 months. There are currently no approved therapies specifically aimed at mCRPC having AR resistance variants, including AR-v7 splice variant. Studies have shown that approximately 20% to 40% of mCRPC patients demonstrate primary resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide and virtually all patients who demonstrate initial clinical responses eventually acquire resistance. As a result, there is a significant need for the identification and development of therapies that can both treat mCRPC and limit inducement of resistance mechanisms. 
 Our Solution: FT-7051 
 Our other product candidate, FT-7051, is a potent and selective inhibitor of CBP/p300, initially being studied for the treatment of mCRPC. Multiple third-party studies have demonstrated that the CBP/p300 protein complex is an upstream co-activator of AR and upregulation of this AR co-activator is one of the mechanisms that can lead to mCRPC. Inhibition of CBP/p300 has demonstrated the ability to suppress wild type, or WT, AR and mutated AR driven transcription of genes that drive the growth of prostate cancer cells. Thus, we believe that CBP/p300 inhibitors have the potential to address prostate cancer cell resistance related to molecular alteration of AR, including AR-v7. 
 FT-7051 and FT-6876 (a research compound) are inhibitors of the bromodomain of CBP/p300 that we have developed with the goal of generating novel treatments for mCRPC. Our preclinical experiments with both FT-7051 and FT-6876 have demonstrated antitumor activity against enzalutamide-sensitive and enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived prostate cancer cell xenografts. In vitro, both FT-7051 and FT-6876 are antiproliferative in AR positive prostate cancer cell lines, including AR-v7 positive models, and are inactive in AR negative cell lines. FT-7051 was ultimately selected for clinical development due to its more favorable metabolic property and lower predicted efficacious human dose (100-200 mg). The data generated for FT-6876 was accepted for publication at the American Association for Cancer Research 2020 meeting and was available at a virtual presentation in June 2020. 
 FT-7051 has been observed to be highly potent (IC50, or the concentration of drug required to inhibit CBP binding to an acetylated histone peptide by 50%, less than one nanomolar) and selective (more than 500-fold more selective than other bromodomain-containing proteins) in preclinical studies. No significant findings were observed during in vitro safety pharmacology studies of FT-7051. Good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies have been completed and show an acceptable tolerability margin for the predicted efficacious human 
 4


dose of 100-200 mg daily. In addition, the current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, is complete and the drug product manufacturing is ongoing. The FDA cleared our IND for FT-7051 in April 2020. We believe that FT-7051 has a preclinical tolerability profile and physicochemical properties supportive of proceeding with clinical development. Accordingly, we have initiated a Phase I trial in mCRPC patients and announced first patient enrolled in January 2021. Initial results from this Phase I trial are expected in the second half of 2021, which may include safety/tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary biomarker data, and clinical activity results are anticipated to be available in 2022.  We believe that demonstration of activity in mCRPC could create opportunities for development of FT-7051 in earlier lines of prostate cancer therapy as well as in other tumors where AR-driven transcription may be important, such as AR positive breast cancer.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to transform the lives of patients with rare hematologic diseases and cancers. To achieve this strategy, we are focused on the following key objectives: 

• | Advance FT-4202 through clinical development for the treatment of SCD. While existing therapies treat symptoms, there remains a significant unmet need for disease-modifying therapies for SCD patients. We are currently evaluating FT-4202 in a multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase I trial in SCD patients ages 12 years and older, as well as a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial. We reported data from a single dose cohort of seven SCD patients in June 2020 and the MAD 1 300mg dose cohort of nine SCD patients in December 2020. We reported data from the MAD 2 600mg dose cohort in the first quarter of 2021, and expect to report initial results from a three-month open label extension in SCD patients in the second quarter of 2021. We expect additional data from this open label extension trial throughout the course of the year. In parallel with our ongoing Phase I trial, a global pivotal Phase II/III trial in SCD is currently enrolling patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance FT-7051 through clinical development for the treatment of mCRPC. mCRPC patients with resistant mutations, including AR splice variants, generally have a poor prognosis. The FDA cleared our IND for FT-7051 in April 2020, and we initiated a Phase I trial in mCRPC patients in January 2021. Pending favorable safety and initial activity data from the Phase I trial in mCRPC patients resistant to standard of care, we may evaluate FT-7051 in earlier lines of mCRPC as well as other AR-dependent cancers, since FT-7051’s mechanism of action could apply to any AR-driven cancer. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand clinical development of FT-4202 into thalassemia. Hemoglobinopathies are a diverse range of rare inherited genetic disorders in which there is abnormal production or absence of hemoglobin. Unlike SCD, thalassemia results from decreased or absent production of the one of the subunits of hemoglobin, thereby producing RBCs that have less oxygen carrying capacity than normal RBCs. Further, the reduced levels of beta hemoglobin subunits result in an excess of alpha hemoglobin subunits, which form aggregates that can increase membrane damage and cause hemolysis. We believe that FT-4202 can enhance ATP levels, the energy for cellular function, in beta thalassemia affected RBCs and enable the patients to tolerate the increased membrane damage and reduce hemolysis. The reduction in hemolysis can result in an increase in total hemoglobin that can improve symptoms. We expect to initiate a trial of FT-4202 in patients with alpha and beta thalassemia in the second half of 2021.

• | Maximize the commercial opportunity of our pipeline. We have retained worldwide development and commercial rights to our product candidates, FT-4202 and FT-7051. We are pursuing a development strategy for FT-4202 and FT-7051 in the United States, Europe, and other geographies. As we advance FT-4202 and FT-7051 through development, we intend to establish a focused marketing and sales infrastructure to improve patient access and to maximize commercial success, if approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to build our pipeline with a focus on rare hematologic diseases and cancers. We believe that we can leverage the learnings from the development of our product candidates to expand and build our pipeline internally. We also intend to leverage this knowledge to opportunistically identify and acquire or in-license novel product candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategically evaluate and execute on business development opportunities for olutasidenib and other compounds. We are actively seeking strategic partners to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates, olutasidenib for the treatment of R/R AML and glioma and FT-8225 for the treatment of NASH. In addition, we will selectively evaluate the merits of other business development opportunities if they become available.

Our Product Candidates 
 FT-4202 and Sickle Cell Disease and Hemoglobinopathy Overview 
 SCD is the most common type of hemoglobinopathy, a diverse range of rare inherited genetic disorders that affect hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein in RBCs responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. Normal hemoglobin is a tetramer of two beta-globin and two alpha-globin protein subunits. Mutations in either the beta- or alpha-globin genes may cause abnormalities in the production or structure of these subunits that can lead to toxicity to or reduced oxygen carrying capacity of RBCs. Collectively, disorders that arise from these mutations 
 6


are referred to as hemoglobinopathies. SCD arises from abnormalities in the beta subunit, specifically when a genetic mutation creates the variant form of the beta subunit, called ßs. 
 

SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene that results in a single amino acid substitution that predisposes polymerization of hemoglobin after an RBC has delivered oxygen into peripheral tissues. This polymerization results in deformation of RBCs into a less-pliable, sickle shape. As illustrated in the figure below, sickle-shaped RBCs are prone to aggregation in small blood vessels in peripheral tissues that can block blood flow to organs and cause acute and painful VOC events. As a result of this obstruction, there is destruction of some RBCs, or hemolysis. This destruction of RBCs leads to the intravascular release of hemoglobin which itself can generate highly damaging oxidative chemicals. The release of hemoglobin and other cytoplasmic molecules from RBCs also trigger signaling cascades that lead to platelet activation, increased endothelial adhesion, inflammation in the vasculature and further obstruction of blood vessels. Acute complications of VOC cause tissue damage due to the lack of oxygen delivery to tissues, resulting in severe pain and symptoms, such as acute chest syndrome. Tissues that are deprived of oxygen are subject to ischemia and reperfusion injuries that can cause damage and long-term organ failure. 
 Pathogenesis of SCD 
 

7


The VOC events generally begin early in childhood and may lead to heart and lung complications, renal dysfunction, priapism, spleen enlargement and failure, stroke, retinopathy and mental and physical disabilities. Sickle cell related pain events are common, occurring on approximately 55% of days, as self-reported by SCD patients. Acute chest syndrome occurs in approximately half of all patients with SCD and is a leading cause of hospitalization and death among patients with SCD. Stroke occurs in 11% of patients with SCD by the age of 20 and in 24% of patients by the age of 45. Approximately 10% of patients with SCD suffer from pulmonary hypertension. Some patients with SCD experience end-stage renal failure that requires dialysis and portends a one-year mortality of 26%. Adult patients with SCD are hospitalized 1.5 times per year on average, and one-third of patients with SCD are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of initial hospitalization. 
 
Addressable SCD Patient Population 
 SCD is one of the most common single-gene disorders, affecting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States and approximately 30,000 individuals in the EU 5. Reporting limitations complicate stating an exact number, but the NIH reports prevalence is estimated at over 20 million individuals worldwide. Despite available treatment options, most patients with SCD still suffer from lifelong disability, significant morbidity, reduced quality of life and average reduction of life expectancy by 25 to 30 years. Due to its chronic nature, the economic burden of SCD is high, both in terms of direct costs for lifelong management, hospitalizations and associated morbidities, and indirect costs of lost lifetime earnings and reduced productivity of both patients and caregivers. Longitudinal estimates suggest that on a per patient basis, cumulative lifetime healthcare costs for this population in the U.S. could exceed approximately $9 million, assuming the patient lives until approximately age 50, excluding costs associated with productivity loss and reduced quality of life. 
 Due to the progressive nature of SCD, we believe that early interventions that modify the disease but do not affect pediatric growth and development are needed. Emerging treatments for SCD target the mechanism of disease (HbS polymerization) or the underlying cause of disease (mutations in hemoglobin); however, we believe these treatment strategies are limited in their outcomes or applicability, and disease-modifying therapies that are safe, effective and accessible for the majority of SCD patients are needed. 
 Current Treatment Paradigm and Unmet Patient Need 
 There are several SCD therapeutic strategies based on addressing disease pathophysiology’s: curative therapies, disease modifying agents, symptomatic therapies administered as chronic prophylaxis or supportive care for acute crises. The only curative treatment option for SCD is HSCT; however, its use is severely limited by toxic preconditioning regimens, donor availability and the need for post-transplant immunosuppression. HU and opioids are the standard non-curative treatments for chronic and acute care, respectively. Recent approval of voxelotor and crizanlizumab will evolve the treatment paradigm but are in early stages of adoption. The figure below illustrates the current therapeutic strategies and approved modalities for the treatment of SCD. 
Overview of Therapeutic Strategies 
 
8



For most patients, treatment involves supportive care for management of VOCs and the use of HU to stimulate production of HbF and reduce HbS polymerization and consequent RBC sickling. Supportive care for the management of painful VOCs entails the use of opioids, which are effective at managing pain but are highly addictive. While inducing HbF can be effective therapeutically, HU can suppress bone marrow function and cause birth defects. Although HU is considered to have an acceptable therapeutic index given the consequences of SCD, HU is underutilized due to safety concerns and side effects.
 An alternative approach to HbF induction is exemplified by the small molecule voxelotor, which is designed to reduce HbS polymerization by binding to the HbS molecule and stabilizing its binding to oxygen. Thus, the mechanism of voxelotor is specific for increasing HbS oxygenation to reduce HbS polymerization. While it achieved a1 g/dL increase in Hb content in about 50% of patients, it did not alter the rate of VOCs requiring hospitalization. Another approach to treatment is exemplified by crizanlizumab, a P-selectin blocking monoclonal antibody, which reduces VOCs but does not impact hemoglobin levels. 
 A potentially curative therapy, allogeneic HSCT, is an invasive, potentially toxic, high-risk procedure limited by matched donor availability and significant procedure-associated morbidities. Similarly, gene therapy and gene editing approaches in development provide promise for cures but are invasive, high-risk procedures that require toxic preconditioning regimens to ablate the bone marrow and make room for engineered cells that express either normal beta-globin or elevated levels of HbF. Furthermore, the long-term therapeutic durability of these approaches is unknown. 
 While there has been an increase in novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of SCD, we believe that drugs with effects on both hemoglobin and VOCs with good safety and tolerability profiles are still needed to manage patients with this disease. Despite currently available treatment options, significant unmet needs remain as most patients with SCD suffer from significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, lifelong disability and average life expectancy that is 25 to 30 years lower than that of unaffected adults. 
 Role of 2,3-DPG and ATP in SCD 
 As illustrated in the figure below, RBC metabolism utilizes glycolysis in order to generate ATP. 2,3-DPG is an intermediate in the glycolytic pathway and accumulates in RBCs under certain physiologic conditions. 2,3-DPG plays an important role in the ability of hemoglobin to bind oxygen. 2,3-DPG selectively binds to deoxyhemoglobin, making it harder for oxygen to bind hemoglobin and more likely to be released to adjacent tissues. 2,3-DPG is part of a feedback loop that can help prevent tissue hypoxia in conditions where it is most likely to occur. Under conditions of low tissue oxygen concentration such as high altitude, airway obstruction, or congestive heart failure, RBCs and the surrounding tissues increase the rate of glycolysis in RBCs to produce ATP, thus generating more 2,3-DPG. The accumulation of 2,3-DPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen eventually releasing it into the tissues that need it most. 
 PKR activation has potential to reduce both hemoglobin sickling and hemolysis via a reduction in 2,3-DPG and an increase in ATP. PKR activation depletes 2,3-DPG and increases ATP levels, thus increasing the energy supply of cells. We believe that increasing cellular ATP may enhance the RBCs’ ability to repair membrane damage and tolerate deformation in capillaries. Combining these two activities, we believe that a PKR activator has the potential to reduce the likelihood of sickling and increase the ability of RBCs to transit through small blood vessels without hemolysis. As illustrated in the figure below, we are evaluating FT-4202, a PKR activator, for its ability to increase hemoglobin levels and reduce VOCs in SCD patients.

Potential of PKR to Reduce Hemoglobin Sickling and Hemolysis 
 

PKR plays a major role as a regulator of metabolic flux through the glycolytic pathway. We believe that activation of PKR offers the potential to decrease 2,3-DPG and increase ATP, which we believe would reduce RBC sickling and cell membrane damage from HbS polymerization. As illustrated in the figure below, 2,3-DPG levels are significantly higher and ATP levels significantly lower in SCD RBCs compared with normal healthy RBCs. We believe that through a reduction in 2,3-DPG and an increase in ATP, a PKR activator has the potential to positively impact physiological changes that lead to the clinical pathologies of SCD and yield a broader and more significant impact on SCD disease than other agents directly modifying HbS, which we believe may not directly improve RBC health and membrane integrity.

Preclinical Studies of FT-4202 
 Our preclinical studies to date support the FT-4202 mechanism of action. These preclinical studies include the following:
  
• | Increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity: We have observed, as illustrated in the figure below, that incubating FT-4202 with RBCs from healthy donors and SCD donors increases RBC oxygen affinity, as reflected by the leftward shift in the curves, which can be characterized by the oxygen level at which 50% of hemoglobin is oxygenated, or P50. The black and blue curves represent the oxygen binding of a healthy donor and an SCD patient, respectively. Note that the SCD patient curve is right-shifted demonstrating the early release of oxygen by HbS. The green and dashed-red curves represent the healthy donor and SCD patient samples, respectively, after treatment with FT-4202. After FT-4202 treatment, the curves shift to the left, indicative of tighter binding of oxygen. As illustrated in the figure below, FT-4202 normalizes the SCD oxygen affinity, resulting in overlap of the dashed-red FT-4202-treated SCD donor curve with the black, untreated healthy donor curve.

Increases in Hemoglobin Oxygen Affinity (P50) in Mixing FT-4202 in In Vitro Studies with RBCs From Healthy and SCD Donors 
 
 
• | Reduction in RBC sickling: The biologic consequences of increased PKR activation by FT-4202 in sickle RBCs is demonstrated in the figure below. We observed an effect of FT-4202 on SCD RBC sickling as measured by the deformability (or elongation index, EI), of the sickle RBC under decreasing (and then increasing) levels of oxygen and the Point of Sickling, or POS, defined as the pO2 concentration where an initial decrease in EI is observed. As shown in the figure below, comparison of the red and blue curves measuring pO2 concentration in the presence and absence of FT-4202, respectively, demonstrates that FT-4202 treatment delays the onset of RBC sickling and improves RBC deformability at low oxygen tensions suggesting that the FT-4202 treated sickle RBC can maintain a higher level of deformability as the RBCs transverse the microvasculature at lower oxygen levels.

Reduction of the Point of Sickling in SCD RBCs 
 
Potential Differentiating Features of FT-4202 
 FT-4202 is a potent activator of PKR and is designed to be a multi-modal metabolic modulator of RBCs. Activation of PKR simultaneously reduces 2,3-DPG concentrations, which increases hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and decreases sickling, while also increasing intracellular ATP, which we believe improves RBC health and reduces hemolysis.
 Based on our previous studies, we believe that FT-4202 potentially represents an important advancement for patients living with SCD and other hemoglobinopathies. The differentiating features of FT-4202 may include the following: 
  
• | Modulates RBC metabolism via a multi-modal approach by decreasing 2,3-DPG and increasing ATP. Decreasing the concentration of 2,3-DPG has been observed to normalize hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and decrease RBC sickling in vitro. Reduced RBC sickling has the potential to improve patients’ hemoglobin levels and reduce their VOCs. FT-4202 may also improve RBC membrane health and integrity by increasing ATP, resulting in a more flexible RBC membrane for improved blood flow and potentially lessening the occurrences of VOCs. A rapid onset of activity has been observed within hours in vitro and within one (1) day in healthy volunteers and SCD patients, including improved RBC deformability across an oxygen gradient (oxygen scan) and across an osmolality gradient (osmoscan), indicating an effect on RBC sickling and RBC membrane health, respectively. The relatively rapid onset of FT-4202’s impact contrasts with current treatment regimens that we believe may take longer to demonstrate anti-sickling effects.

• | Is well-tolerated in clinical trials to date and has not shown evidence of inhibition of aromatase, an enzyme involved in converting testosterone to estrogen, which may permit dosing in a broad range of patients, including both pediatric and adult populations, as it does not lead to alterations in the hormones that affect pediatric growth and development. FT-4202 has not demonstrated any preclinical evidence of arrhythmia risk, mutagenicity, or nonspecific binding activity for panels of receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and kinases in vitro, suggesting a potentially positive safety profile. Given this profile, we believe that FT-4202 has the potential to be a foundational treatment for patients early in life. Patients may benefit from being treated early to potentially lessen the impact of the disease.

• | Will be administered orally once daily. A dose-exposure-response analysis utilizing the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, or PK/PD, of results obtained from the healthy volunteers and SCD patients supports once-daily dosing, without the need for extensive monitoring or dose adjustments, potentially improving compliance issues historically seen with SCD patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrates a lack of CYP inhibition or induction preclinically, and does not auto induce metabolism. This may reduce risk for drug-drug interactions and also lead to predictable dose-response with chronic dosing. CYP effects pharmacokinetics of other drugs through changes in plasma concentration. SCD patients typically take numerous concurrent medications to address their disease. The body will naturally break down these medications through CYP. When the expression of these enzymes is inhibited or induced by another medication, it can impact the efficacy of concurrent medications. Limiting the potential for drug-drug interactions is imperative to effectively treat this patient population. FT-4202 has been observed preclinically to have no significant impact on CYP enzyme inhibition or induction.

Ongoing Phase I Trial for FT-4202 
 As illustrated in the figure below, our ongoing Phase I trial for FT-4202 to assess the safety and PK/PD of FT-4202 is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, single dose and MAD trial in healthy adult volunteers and a single dose and MAD trial in adolescent or adult patients with SCD. The trial also includes a 12-week dosing cohort in which up to 20 SCD patients will each receive up to 84 consecutive daily doses of FT-4202. 
 As of March 15, 2021, FT-4202 or placebo has been evaluated in 90 healthy volunteers,  (FT-4202 n=70; placebo n=20), in 7 SCD patients as a single dose cohort (FT-4202 n=5; placebo n=2), in 10 SCD patients in the MAD 1 cohort (1st 9 patients randomized to 300 mg FT-4202 n=7 or placebo n=2) and in 9 SCD patients in the MAD 2 cohort (randomized to 600 mg FT-4202 n=7 or placebo n=2). SCD patients completing the MAD 2 cohort are eligible to enroll in the 12-week open label extension cohort, receiving 400 mg FT-4202 daily. We reported data from the second multiple ascending dose, or MAD 2 cohort, in the first quarter of 2021, and expect to report initial results from a 12-week open label extension in SCD patients in the second quarter of 2021.
 Phase I Trial Design for FT-4202 
 

To date in our Phase I trial, we believe that FT-4202 has demonstrated a promising tolerability profile and time-independent PK profile. As illustrated in the figure below, in RBCs of healthy volunteers, FT-4202 has demonstrated a reduction in 2,3-DPG (left) and an increase in ATP (right), thus providing support for PKR activation in healthy RBCs. Notably, these effects were maintained for more than one day (2,3-DPG reduction) and for more than three days (ATP increase) after FT-4202 dosing was stopped at day 14.

FT-4202 Decreases 2,3-DPG and Increases ATP in RBCs in Healthy Volunteers 
 

We have also observed in our Phase I trial that all doses of FT-4202 increase oxygen affinity, as illustrated in the left side of the figure below. As illustrated in the right side of the figure below, this increase in oxygen affinity correlated with the reduction of 2,3-DPG, demonstrating preliminary proof of mechanism in healthy RBCs and supporting further clinical development of FT-4202 in patients with SCD. 
 Changes in Oxygen Affinity in Healthy Volunteers Receiving Single or Multiple Doses of FT-4202 Correlate with Observed Decrease in 2,3-DPG 
 
 
In the figure below, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from the healthy volunteer studies were modelled to predict the FT-4202 exposure to a maximum 2,3-DPG and ATP response. Based on this analysis an exposure achieved with 150 mg daily of FT-4202 or greater would provide a maximum increase in ATP. Maximum 2,3-DPG responses would require FT-4202 doses of 400 mg daily or greater.

Predicted Exposure/PD response in HV RBCs: Defined an 
 Exposure to Max PD Response Dose Range to Test in SCD 
 

Based upon PK/PD modelling and to directly compare with healthy volunteer findings, 700 mg was selected as a dose level for the single-dose cohort of patients with SCD. In healthy volunteers, FT-4202 was well-tolerated with headache as the most common adverse event reported in patients receiving a single dose (4%) or 14 days (28%) of FT-4202. In SCD patients, six adverse events were observed with three adverse events occurring in two of five patients (40%) receiving 700 mg of FT-4202 and two of two patients (100%) receiving placebo. All adverse events were mild (Grade 1) and transient. Based on this acceptable tolerability profile of a single 700 mg dose of FT-4202, the MAD1 cohort (300 mg daily) was opened for enrollment.
 FT-4202-Single Ascending Dose in SCD Patients 
 
As illustrated in the figure below, the PK profile of FT-4202 was similar in healthy volunteers and SCD patients. FT-4202 was rapidly absorbed with a median time of maximum concentration observed (Tmax) of one-hour post-dose and a half-life of approximately 10-13 hours. Maximum PD activity (decrease in 2,3-DPG and increase in ATP) was observed in the RBCs of SCD patients 24 hours after a single dose of FT-4202. 
 

Single Dose FT-4202 PK/PD Studies in Patients With SCD 
 
 
The biologic consequence of a decrease in 2,3-DPG was found to be the same in healthy and SCD RBCs. As illustrated in the figure below, similar to what was previously observed in RBCs of healthy volunteers, an increase in oxygen affinity (decreased P50) was observed in SCD RBCs within 24 hours of FT-4202 dosing. The increase in oxygen affinity correlated with a reduction in 2,3-DPG in both healthy volunteers and SCD patients. 
 15


Biologic Consequence of Decreased 2,3-DPG is the Same in Healthy and SCD RBCs: Increased Oxygen Affinity 
 
 
As illustrated in the figures below, similar to previous in vitro mixing studies, the decrease in 2,3-DPG levels resulted in an increase in oxygen affinity of SCD RBCs across an oxygen gradient (Figure A), and no changes in oxygen affinity were observed in placebo treated SCD RBCs (Figure B). The biologic consequence of the left-shift in oxygen affinity across the oxygen gradient is a decrease in POS to lower oxygen tension. The POS represents the oxygen tension where HbS polymerization becomes symptomatic by a reduction in the RBC deformability. By shifting the POS to lower oxygen tensions, FT-4202 showed improvements to the deformability of SCD RBCs at very low oxygen tensions (Figure C). SCD RBCs from patients receiving placebo showed no change in deformability (Figure D).

The ability to maintain cellular hydration is a critical function of the RBC membrane. In order to measure the impact of FT-4202 on this critical function, the effect of FT-4202 compared to placebo on the deformability of SCD RBCs across an osmolality gradient was evaluated. As illustrated in the figure below, FT-4202 (Figure A) improved the deformability of SCD RBCs under conditions of both low osmolality (Omin) and high osmolality (Ohyper), shifting the response towards normal. SCD RBCs from placebo treated patients showed no change (Figure B). 
 A single dose of FT-4202 improves SCD RBC membrane response to an osmolality gradient 
 

The effects of a single dose of FT-4202 compared to placebo on hematologic parameters was also evaluated. In patients who received FT-4202 an increase in hemoglobin, an increase in RBC counts and a decrease in absolute reticulocyte counts were observed 24 hours after dosing, returning to baseline levels by 72 hours after dosing. Patients who received placebo were observed to have a decrease in hemoglobin and RBCs, with an increase in reticulocyte counts at 24 hours. The improvement in hematologic indices coincided with the maximum PD effects (decreased 2,3-DPG and increased ATP), returning to baseline by 72 hours despite persistent increase in ATP levels. These observations suggest that maximum clinical benefit (e.g. improved hemoglobin) is more likely to be observed with sustained PD activity of both 2,3 DPG reduction and ATP increase.

Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Cohorts in SCD Patients
 
The MAD 1 and MAD 2 cohorts are designed to enroll 9 to 12 randomly assigned patients per cohort, with each patient receiving 14 consecutive daily doses of FT-4202 (n = 7 to 9) or placebo (n = 2 to 3). The MAD 1 cohort has an initial daily dose of FT-4202 of 300 mg for 14 days to be evaluated in SCD patients, which was selected from the daily dose range of FT-4202 evaluated in the healthy adult volunteers that was found to be tolerable and pharmacodynamically active. As of March 15, 2021, 300 mg of FT-4202 or placebo daily for 14 days has been evaluated in nine SCD patients in the MAD 1 cohort (the 1st 9 patients randomized FT-4202 n=7; placebo n=2). ).  Nine SCD patients in the MAD 2 cohort have received 600 mg of FT-4202 or placebo daily for 14 days (randomized FT-4202 n=7; placebo n=2). Data from the second multiple ascending dose, or MAD 2 cohort was reported in the first quarter of 2021, and initial results from a 12-week open label extension in SCD patients are expected to be reported in the second quarter of 2021.
 Data were reported at American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting on December 7, 2020. Results were based on blinded data from the first nine patients with SCD (FT-4202 n=7; placebo n=2) randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 300 mg daily of FT-4202 or placebo for 14 days. The data show that, from baseline, in patients receiving FT-4202: 
  
• | six of seven patients achieved a greater than 1 g/dL increase in Hb; median 1.2 g/dL increase (range 0, 2.3 g/dL);

 Results from the MAD 2 cohort with a single oral dose of 600 mg of FT-4202 daily for 14 days were reported in the first quarter of 2021. We also intend to enroll up to 20 SCD patients in a 12-week open label dosing cohort. Patients will receive a 400 mg daily doses of FT-4202 for up to 84 consecutive days. The three-month open label extension is presently enrolling and expected to yield initial results in the second quarter of 2021.
 
Regulatory Plans 
 Based upon preclinical and clinical findings to date, we have commenced a registration-enabling global adaptive randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel group, multi-center Phase II/III trial of FT-4202 in patients with SCD, ages 12 to 65 years. This trial is currently enrolling patients.  Based on feedback from the FDA, we plan to pursue accelerated approval utilizing hemoglobin response as a primary endpoint while collecting additional blinded endpoints around rates of VOC to verify clinical benefit and further support approval. We are also currently engaging with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to determine the appropriate regulatory approach for the European Union.

Indication Expansion 
 We believe that FT-4202’s target supports clinical development across a number of adjacent indications. Initially, we intend to expand the development of FT-4202 into thalassemia. Thalassemia is a rare genetic disease with an estimated prevalence of approximately 20,000 – 25,000 patients (predominantly beta thalassemia) across the United States and Europe and approximately 300,000 patients globally. 
 In beta thalassemia, mutations in the beta-globin gene cause a reduction in the production of the beta-globin subunit, which results both in a reduction in the total amount of oxygen carrying tetrameric hemoglobin within a RBC as well as an excess of alpha hemoglobin subunits that aggregate and cause RBC toxicity and destruction, or hemolysis. 
 Patients with beta thalassemia are often classified into one of two groups; (i) transfusion dependent patients, and (ii) non-transfusion dependent patients. Transfusion dependent patients can require frequent blood transfusions, which may result in an overload of iron in tissues that can damage organs such as the liver, heart, and endocrine organs. As a consequence, iron depleting agents are used to minimize the consequences of iron overload. HSCT can be curative for beta thalassemia patients, but procedure related toxicity and donor availability limit this as a therapeutic option. In November 2019, Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) was approved for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients who are transfusion dependent. While studies suggest that luspatercept-aamt can reduce the number of transfusions these patients still remain transfusion dependent and significant unmet needs remain for these patients. 
 RBCs in beta thalassemia patients have increased alpha-globin protein aggregates, free heme, and free iron that all cause an increase in the levels of toxic reactive oxygen species, which damage RBC membranes. Consequently, ATP is consumed more avidly in the RBCs of beta thalassemia patients, and this depletion of ATP stores is believed to be key to the reduced life span of RBCs and increased hemolysis in these patients. By increasing ATP levels in the RBCs of beta thalassemia patients, we believe that FT-4202 should be able to reduce hemolysis and increase total body hemoglobin levels. In both preclinical models of beta thalassemia and early clinical studies, mitapivat, another PKR activator in clinical development by a third party, has demonstrated the ability to increase RBC life span and increase total hemoglobin. Therefore, we believe that FT-4202 could deliver similar benefits in beta thalassemia patients. However, we also believe that the potential for once per day dosing for FT-4202 versus twice per day for mitapivat and FT-4202’s potentially differentiated pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic profile may enable FT-4202 to be developed as a leading therapeutic option for these patients. Gene therapy approaches to increasing either beta-globin or HbF expression in autologous hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation are also in development but are limited by the need for marrow preconditioning and anticipated high cost. 
 FT-7051 and mCRPC Overview 
 Addressable mCRPC Patient Population 
 Prostate cancer is reported as the second and third leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States and in Europe, respectively, and mCRPC is the most advanced form of the disease. Approximately one in 41 men will die of prostate cancer, and approximately one in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. The average age at diagnosis of prostate cancer is 66. The incidence of prostate cancer has been estimated to reach approximately 192,000 and 365,000 patients in the United States and Europe, respectively, and approximately 30,000 prostate cancer deaths were estimated in the United States in 2018. Such deaths are typically the result of the most advanced form of prostate cancer, mCRPC. 
Current Treatment Paradigm and Unmet Patient Need 
 The selection of prostate cancer treatments depends upon the burden of disease, Gleason score, and age of the patient. These options vary based on low risk or more advanced disease. Options for low risk disease may include active surveillance, prostatectomy, or radiation therapy, whereas aggressive surgical interventions and androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, may be used for more advanced disease. Androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, activate AR-dependent gene transcription which drives the growth of prostate cancer cells. ADT, which blocks testicular production of testosterone and is otherwise known as chemical castration, is administered for those patients who present initially with regional or advanced disease at diagnosis or develop advanced disease at recurrence. ADT, such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, or LHRH, receptor agonists and antagonists (flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide) are known to provide 
 20


remission of the disease, best evidenced by a decline of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, in about 90% of patients. After a mean time of two to three years, however, the disease progresses despite continuous hormonal manipulation and is then referred to as CRPC. 
 Subsequent to development of CRPC, ADT, in combination with the adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitor, abiraterone acetate, or AR antagonists that bind to the ligand binding domain, such as enzalutamide and apalutamide, have demonstrated improved overall, progression-free, and metastastis-free survival, increased time to progression, reductions in PSA, and radiographic responses. However, studies have shown that approximately 20% to 40% of mCRPC patients demonstrate primary resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate and virtually all patients who demonstrate initial clinical responses eventually acquire resistance. Other palliative treatments for mCRPC include taxane chemotherapy, Sipuleucel-T and Xofigo for treatment of bone metastases. Unfortunately, the five-year survival rate for patients with mCRPC progressing on or after first line chemotherapy is estimated at only 1.6%. As a result, there is significant need for new treatments of mCRPC. 
 Prostate cancer cells can become castration-resistant by several mechanisms, including: (i) mutation of the AR to allow for activation by non-androgen steroids, such as corticosteroids, estrogen, and progesterone, (ii) amplification of the AR that enables cancer cells to thrive on the low levels of androgens made by the adrenal gland, (iii) overexpression of co-activator proteins, including CBP/p300, that enhance AR induced transcriptional activity, (iv) intra-tumoral androgen synthesis, (v) upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor and (vi) an increase in splice variants, such as AR-v7, that are always active even in the absence of androgen binding. While abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or apalutamide address some but not all of these resistance mechanisms, they may induce prostate cancer cells to express the AR-v7 variant that confers resistance to all three of these agents. Patients whose prostate cancer cells express the AR-v7 variant, which enables the AR to be active even in the absence of androgen binding, generally have a poor prognosis. According to a recent publication, and as seen in the figure below, AR-v7 positive mCRPC patients have a median OS rate of 10.8 months whereas AR-v7 negative patients in the same trial had an OS rate of 27.2 months. 
 Kaplan-Meier Plot of OS for mCRPC Patients Whose Tumors are Positive or Negative for AR-v7 Alteration 
 

Among these resistance mechanisms, particularly challenging are AR structural variations in the ligand binding domain, which render the receptor ligand-independent and insensitive to approved AR antagonists. Approximately 20 AR mRNA splice variants have been identified, and a subset are constitutively active, meaning they do not require steroid binding to AR to drive activation of this transcription factor. Of the AR 
 21


variants, only AR-v7 and ARv567 have been detected at the protein level, and AR-v7 has been the most studied. Notably, in cases of mCRPC where patients were initially treated with an AR antagonist, those with AR-v7 positive circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, showed poorer PSA response, and shorter progression-free survival and OS compared to those negative for AR-v7 CTCs. Furthermore, in blood samples from mCRPC patients, the frequency of AR-v7 protein detection in CTC nuclei increased from 3% of samples from patients following first line of therapy to 31% of samples for the third or more lines of therapy. We believe that findings such as these point to the potential for using AR-v7 as a patient selection biomarker, and its potential utility for determining which patients with mCRPC may benefit from new therapeutics active against AR-v7. 
 All biologically active forms of the AR retain the N-terminal domain, or NTD, and drugs in development that target the NTD have the potential to impact all AR forms, including those that may drive resistance to AR 
 antagonists such as enzalutamide and apalutamide, which bind to the ligand binding domain. CBP/p300 are well-studied and essential co-activators of AR-mediated gene expression in prostate cancer. Upregulation of the CBP/p300 co-activator is one of the mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells become castration resistant. As shown in the figure below, the catalytic core of CBP/p300 contains domains that “write,” or modify, and “read,” or interpret, the chemical signals on histones, which are proteins that package DNA and can determine whether and when a gene is expressed. The reader domain on CBP/p300 binds these acetylated histones when interacting with AR. The writer domain on CBP/p300 modifies histones by adding acetyl groups enabling transcription factors that drive gene expression. When active, CBP/p300 results in a permissive configuration of histone-wrapped DNA, or chromatin, that promotes transcription by AR in prostate cancer. Importantly, CBP/p300 binds AR-v7 variants that do not require testosterone to bring it into proximity with its target DNA. Consequently, since CBP/p300 is a necessary co-activator of AR, we believe an inhibitor to CBP/p300 could address the many AR-dependent mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells become castration-resistant. 
 Overview of CBP/p300 Impact on AR Positive Prostate Cancer 
 
Our Approach: FT-7051 
 FT-7051 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CBP/p300 in clinical development for the treatment of mCRPC. Inhibition of CBP/p300 can suppress AR and AR-v7 driven transcription of genes that drive the growth of prostate cancer cells. Thus, we believe that CBP/p300 inhibitors have the potential to address prostate cancer cell resistance related to molecular alterations in AR, including AR-v7. FT-7051 and FT-6876 (a research compound) are inhibitors of the bromodomain of CBP/p300 that we have developed with the goal of generating novel treatments for mCRPC. Our preclinical experiments with both FT-7051 and FT-6876 have demonstrated antitumor activity against enzalutamide-sensitive and enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived prostate cancer cell xenografts. In vitro, both FT-7051 and FT-6876 are antiproliferative in AR positive prostate cancer cell lines, including AR-v7 positive models, and are inactive in AR-negative cell lines. FT-7051 was ultimately selected for clinical development because it exhibited more favorable metabolic properties in our preclinical 
 22


studies and is predicted to have a lower efficacious human dose (100-200 mg). The data generated for FT-6876 was accepted for publication at the American Association for Cancer Research 2020 meeting and was presented virtually in June 2020. 
 FT-7051 has been observed to be highly potent (IC50 for CBP binding to acetylated histone peptide less than one nanomolar) and selective (more than 500-fold more selective than other bromodomain-containing proteins) in preclinical studies. No significant findings were observed during in vitro safety pharmacology studies of FT-7051. GLP toxicology studies have been completed and show an acceptable tolerability margin for the predicted efficacious human dose of 100-200 mg daily. In addition, the cGMP manufacturing of API and drug product is complete. The FDA cleared our IND for FT-7051 in April 2020, and the compound’s preclinical tolerability profile and physicochemical properties have supported proceeding with clinical development.  We believe that demonstration of activity in mCRPC could create opportunities for development of FT-7051 in earlier lines of prostate cancer therapy as well as in other tumors where AR driven transcription may be important, such as AR positive breast cancer. 
 CBP/p300 Target 
 Inhibition of CBP/p300 could antagonize AR signaling and demonstrate clinical benefit in CRPC and other AR positive cancers. By reducing histone acetylation specifically in AR driven transcription, we believe the downstream effects of AR signaling should be reduced. 
 Suppression of AR-driven transcriptional programs through inhibition of CBP/p300 offers an approach that differs from direct receptor antagonists and is unaffected by structural variations in the AR ligand binding domain. As CBP/p300 are upstream of AR activation, we believe that inhibition has the potential to address not only the observed resistance mechanisms but to also be effective in earlier lines of therapy and other AR-dependent cancers. The therapeutic benefits of AR inhibition have been observed clinically in these cancers, albeit with limitations that highlight the need for alternative approaches with long-term benefit and mechanisms of resistance non-overlapping with anti-androgen therapy. 
 Preclinical Studies of FT-7051 
 We believe that our preclinical studies to date support the ability of our inhibitors, including FT-7051, to selectively target CBP/p300 in order to decrease AR signaling and tumor growth in prostate cancer. These preclinical studies include the following: 

• | Inhibition of AR transcriptional activity: We observed reduced expression of AR target genes in a concentration-dependent manner in both the androgen-independent and androgen-dependent cell lines exposed to a range of FT-7051 concentrations for 24 hours. Androgen-independent and androgen-dependent cell lines mimic castration resistance and hormone sensitive tumors, respectively. As illustrated in the figure below, AR target gene expression decreased as analyzed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction with results expressed as percentages relative to DMSO control. We selected AR target genes from the AR gene set defined by the Broad Institute, including KLK3, TMPRSS2, FKBP5, SORD, SPDEF and MYC.

AR Target Gene Expression in Androgen-independent or dependent Cells After 24 Hour Exposure to Increasing Concentrations of FT-7051 
 

 
• | Reduction in AR and AR-v7 expression: Transfer of acetyl groups, or acetylation to lysines on AR by CBP/p300 is known to stabilize AR protein. As illustrated in the figure below, we observed that the inhibition of CBP/p300 activity by FT-7051 induced a dose dependent reduction of AR protein levels in the androgen-independent and androgen-dependent cell lines. AR-v7 was reduced in the androgen-independent cell line. DMSO is the vehicle used to deliver the drug and is thus a negative control. Actin is used as to demonstrate consistent loading across the samples.

 Impact of CBP/p300 Inhibition on AR and AR-v7 Levels in Androgen-independent and Androgen-dependent Prostate Cancer Cells 
 

 
• | Inhibition of chromatin remodeling: Acetylation of histones by CBP/p300 is a common hallmark of chromatin remodeling associated with active AR-target gene expression in prostate cancer. CBP/p300 acetylates Histone 3 Lysine 27 (H3K27). As illustrated in the figure below, we demonstrate that FT-7051 reduces H3K27Ac in a concentration-dependent manner in a prostate cancer cell line. DMSO is the vehicle used to deliver the drug and is thus a negative control. Actin is used to demonstrate consistent loading across the samples.

Concentration Dependent Reduction of H3K27Ac In A Prostate Cancer Cell Line 
 

 
• | Significant anti-tumor activity: FT-7051 inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines and showed antitumor activity in a patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We evaluated the proliferation of several prostate cancer cell lines in the presence of enzalutamide or FT-7051. As expected and illustrated by the table below, enzalutamide was active against androgen-dependent cell lines but was inactive in AR negative and AR-v7 expressing cell lines. FT-7051 was active against AR-expressing cell lines, including AR-v7, as measured by IC50. As shown in the table below, cell lines that do not express AR are not targets for FT-7051.

PC3 | Independent | AR-negative | 8.3 | >10 
DU145 | Independent | AR-negative | 8.9 | >10 

 
We evaluated the antitumor activity of FT-7051 and the research compound, FT-6876, in PDX models of prostate cancer sensitive and resistant to enzalutamide, respectively. As expected, and illustrated in the figure below, enzalutamide was inactive in the enzalutamide-resistant model and FT-6876 induced tumor stasis. In the enzalutamide sensitive model, FT-7051 had a similar anti-tumor activity as enzalutamide.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial 
 We filed an IND with the FDA for FT-7051 in March 2020 and the FDA cleared the IND to initiate a Phase I trial in mCRPC patients, which occurred in January 2021. Pending favorable safety and initial clinical activity data in mCRPC patients resistant to standard of care, we may evaluate FT-7051 in earlier lines of mCRPC as well as other AR-dependent cancers, since FT-7051’s mechanism of action could apply to any AR driven cancer.

Olutasidenib: A Selective Inhibitor for Cancers with Mutations in IDH1 Gene 
 Olutasidenib, a selective inhibitor for cancers with IDH1 mutations, is being evaluated in a registrational Phase II trial for R/R AML and an exploratory Phase I trial for glioma. IDH1 mutations can produce excessive amounts of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which impairs stem cell differentiation and promotes cancer cells to grow and progress in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. 
 IDH1 mutation alterations are seen in AML, glioma, chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. It is estimated that the U.S. prevalence for AML is approximately 20,000 cases and global incidence for AML is approximately 120,000 cases, with approximately 6-8% linked to the IDH1 mutation. The estimated U.S. prevalence of glioma is approximately 19,000 cases and the global incidence of glioma is 176,000 cases, with as much as 70 to 80% linked to the IDH1 mutation in Grade II/III gliomas and secondary glioblastoma. 
 There are currently two products approved in the United States for patients with IDH1 mutation and IDH2 mutation, a similar enzyme. In August 2017, the FDA granted approval to Idhifa (enasidenib), an oral targeted IDH2 mutation inhibitor, for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation. In July 2018, the FDA granted approval to Tibsovo (ivosidenib), an oral targeted IDH1 mutation inhibitor, for adult patients with (i) R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, and (ii) in May 2019, newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation who are at least 75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. 
 Within the current treatment options for R/R AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy and harbor the IDH1 mutation, there is unmet need. We believe that olutasidenib represents a treatment option with reduced QTc potential, a more favorable drug-drug interaction profile (allowing for co-medication) and a stable PK profile that enables a consistent drug exposure over time. 
 There is high unmet medical need for grade II, III and IV glioma patients who are R/R to current frontline treatment. Current care is limited to supportive care and, where applicable, further treatment with frontline therapies. We believe that olutasidenib has the potential to be a treatment for glioma patients who harbor the IDH1 mutation. 
 We presented positive preliminary Phase I data for olutasidenib in R/R and treatment naïve AML, as well as myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, at the 2019 ASH demonstrating the potential of olutasidenib to induce rapid remissions and mutation clearance in a percentage of patients with IDH1 mutation. The AML data was based on continuous oral treatment of olutasidenib for 28-day cycles, either alone (n=32) or in combination with azacitidine (n=46), with a dose evaluation of 300 mg once daily for olutasidenib alone and 150 mg once daily or twice daily for olutasidenib in combination with azacitidine. The findings indicated that olutasidenib was well-tolerated in clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The recommended Phase II dose for both indications is 150mg twice daily. 
 We presented positive preliminary Phase I data for olutasidenib in glioma at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting, or ASCO, demonstrating the brain penetrant properties of olutasidenib and preliminary clinical activity, which suggest potential for response and prolonged disease control in the enhanced (grade III/IV) R/R IDH1-mutated glioma. At the time of the data cut for disclosure at ASCO, of 24 evaluable patients treated (4 grade II, 13 grade III, 7 grade IV), one patient had a partial response and 11 patients had stable disease, as determined by investigator response assessment in neuro-oncology, or RANO, criteria. Twenty-two of the patients’ responses were also evaluated by volumetric changes at a central review, where four patients had more than 50% tumor reduction, one patient had 25% to 50% tumor reduction, and an additional seven patients with prolonged stable disease. 
 Olutasidenib is currently being evaluated in a registrational Phase II trial for R/R AML and an exploratory Phase Ib/II trial for glioma and other solid tumors. In addition to the registrational R/R AML cohort, the Phase II trial includes seven additional cohorts to evaluate olutasidenib across the AML treatment paradigm as either a single agent or in combination with azacitidine, including for patients who have failed a prior IDH1 mutation inhibitor or those who are treatment naïve but are contraindicated for standard of care treatments.

27


The planned interim analysis of the registrational cohort was completed in October 2020, and positive top line results were announced. Olutasidenib demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile as a monotherapy in patients with R/R AML who have a susceptible IDH1 mutation, and achieved a composite complete remission  or CR, or CR plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) rate of 33.3% (30% CR and 3% CRh), the primary efficacy endpoint. While a median duration of CR/CRh has not yet been reached, a sensitivity analysis (with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HCST, as the end of a response) indicates the median duration of CR/CRh to be 13.8 months. The overall response rate (ORR), comprised CR, CRh, CRi, partial response (PR), and morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), was 46% and the median duration of ORR was 11.7 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months. For patients with CR/CRh, the median OS was not yet reached, but the estimated 18-month survival is 87%. 
 Overall survival by best overall response category 
 
Safety results were consistent with previously reported results from our Phase I clinical trial results for olutasidenib in R/R and treatment naïve AML and MDS. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>20%) were nausea (38%), constipation (25%), increased white blood cell count (25%), decreased RBC count (24%), pyrexia (23%), febrile neutropenia (22%), and fatigue (21%). Grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in greater than 10% of patients, regardless of causality, were febrile neutropenia (20%), decreased RBC count (19%), decreased platelet count (16%), and decreased neutrophil count (13%). Grade 3/4 laboratory liver abnormalities reported in 19 (12%) patients led to treatment discontinuation in seven (4%) patients. The preferred terms of these laboratory liver abnormalities were alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, biliary tract disorder, blood bilirubin increased, cholangitis, cholestasis, hepatitis acute, hepatic enzymes increased, liver function test abnormal, liver function test increased, transaminases increased. Investigator-assessed IDH1 differentiation syndrome (all grades) was observed in 21 (14%) patients, which led to treatment discontinuation in three patients and was fatal in one patient. Additional analyses and other outcome measures will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. 
 We believe these data are sufficient for filing a new drug application, or NDA, and have begun preparing the NDA package. We have contracted with Abbott to develop the companion diagnostic.

FT-8225: A Liver-Targeting, Selective Inhibitor for Fatty Acid Synthase for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis 
 FT-8225 is a liver-targeted FASN inhibitor designed to block de novo lipogenesis, or DNL, solely in the liver, and is currently in development for NASH. Preclinical studies have been completed which we believe will enable an IND filing. 
 NASH is a serious progressive liver disease affecting approximately 19 million individuals in the United States, was estimated to affect approximately 37 million in 2019 in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, collectively and is estimated to reach approximately 43 million by 2025 in such countries collectively with no currently approved treatments. The disease is a consequence of over-nutrition that leads to hepatic steatosis progressing to inflammation, cell damage, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. NASH is caused by accumulation of triglycerides, or TG, derived in part from dysregulated DNL. FASN, a key enzyme in the DNL pathway that catalyzes the final step in fatty acid production prior to TG synthesis, has an elevated expression in NASH patients. Elevated DNL can contribute to early points in the pathogenesis of NASH via excessive TG synthesis and subsequent deposition in the liver causing steatosis. 
 Our prior efforts utilizing FT-4101, a FASN inhibitor that distributes systemically in the body showed proof of mechanism in Phase I trials by inhibiting DNL, but also showed dry skin, dry eye, and hair loss by inhibiting DNL in peripheral tissues. These peripheral on-target adverse events motivated us to design a liver-targeting FASN inhibitor. 
 No treatment-related serious adverse events have been reported in FT-4101’s clinical studies. Early clinical studies have shown that inhibition of DNL by blocking either FASN or an upstream enzyme, Acetyl CoA Carboxylase, or ACC, reduces steatosis, making DNL inhibition an attractive target for the treatment of NASH. Critically, FASN inhibitors do not increase TG and ketone bodies observed with ACC 1/2 inhibitors, a consequential outcome for NASH populations with common comorbidities of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
 Preclinical data to date for FT-8225 have demonstrated a profile with the following attributes: 
  
• | selective in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | preferential liver distribution with a liver to plasma ratio of greater than 100;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a potential for combination use due to low drug to drug interaction risk;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | predicted low efficacious exposure;
--+------------------------------------


• | physiochemical, ADME, and PK properties supporting oral dosing of crystalline material; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a process to produce drug product to support partner-directed Phase I trials.

29


Agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim 
 In December 2011, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, with Boehringer Ingelheim, a company existing under the laws of Germany, pursuant to which the parties engage in a collaborative program to develop and commercialize certain small molecule compound libraries, or compound libraries. The collaborative program consists of two phases: (i) a research phase during which we scanned existing compound libraries, and (ii) an optimization phase where Boehringer Ingelheim will further develop and commercialize certain of such compound libraries. The collaborative program is currently in the optimization phase. One molecule discovered during the collaboration program is now in clinical trials. 
 In connection with the research phase, we have granted to Boehringer Ingelheim a non-exclusive license to conduct certain research and optimization activities, and Boehringer Ingelheim has granted to us a non-exclusive license, without the right to grant sublicenses, to conduct any and all activities allocated to us under the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement during the research phase and the optimization phase. In connection with the optimization phase, we have granted to Boehringer Ingelheim an exclusive, worldwide, milestone-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to (i) research, develop, have developed, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer for sale, have offered for sale, import, have imported and otherwise exploit and commercialize certain collaboration compounds and licensed products containing such collaboration compounds and (ii) make derivatives from certain collaboration compounds. Boehringer Ingelheim has granted to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers, for any and all purposes outside the scope of the exclusive license granted to Boehringer Ingelheim. 
 As consideration, we (i) have received an upfront payment, (ii) have received periodic reimbursements for certain of our internal costs and payments to third parties and (iii) are eligible to receive and expect to receive certain contingent payments upon the achievement of certain research, clinical development, regulatory approval and sales milestone events. To date under the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement, we have received payments of approximately $50.1 million comprised of an upfront payment, research funding, and research and development milestone payments. We are eligible to receive, subject to the achievement of certain research, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, additional aggregate payments of up to $126.0 million in connection with the future development of BI1701963 and $134.0 million for the future development of the protein-protein modulator in preclinical development within oncology. 
 The initial research term was four years, with the option for Boehringer Ingelheim to extend the term for a one-year period provided that Boehringer Ingelheim shall be responsible for reimbursing certain of our internal expenses. Unless earlier terminated, the Boehringer Ingelheim Agreement shall expire (i) on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the date of the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to such product in such country, (ii) in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to the last product in all countries and (iii) on a collaboration-by-collaboration basis when no compound or product is being researched, developed or commercialized by either party with commercially reasonable efforts. Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by the other party. 
 
Agreements with Celgene 
 In December 2018, we and our subsidiary, Forma Therapeutics, Inc., entered into two License Agreements, or the Celgene License Agreements, with Celgene pursuant to which we granted to Celgene exclusive rights with respect to the development and commercialization of (i) any and all compounds directed to the target USP30 and (ii) FT-1101 (CC-95775), in each case including any and all derivatives, modifications and improvements thereof and any pharmaceutical products comprising such compounds. 
 As initial consideration for the licenses, Celgene paid us $77.5 million in license fees and subsequently through the first quarter of 2020 paid an additional $7.6 million for transition and transfer activities. As additional consideration for the license, Celgene is required to pay certain amounts upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. No milestones have been achieved to date under the Celgene License Agreements. 
 Furthermore, Celgene is also required to pay to us certain royalties of single digit on net sales in a given calendar year on a product-by-product basis under each Celgene License Agreement. Celgene’s royalty obligations are on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and are subject to certain reductions, including (i) in the event that the exploitation of a product is not covered by a valid claim with the licensed patent rights and (ii) in the event of third parties achieving specifically negotiated levels of competitive market 
 30


share. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by product basis upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last patent which covers a product in such country, (b) the expiration of any exclusivity granted by a regulatory authority and (c) ten (10) years following the first commercial sale of a product in such country. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Celgene License Agreements shall remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until it expires upon the ceasing of making, having made, using, importing, offering for sale and selling any compounds or products prepared in connection therewith in such country. Celgene has the right to at-will termination on a product-by-product basis or in its entirety, subject to certain notice requirements. Either party may terminate either Celgene License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of such agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within a certain number of days after written notice is provided in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. We may terminate each Celgene License Agreement on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis if Celgene does not use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize each product licensed under such Celgene License Agreement upon obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, in each case subject to the terms of such Celgene License Agreement, with respect to such country and product, unless Celgene has provided prior written notice of a plan for the development and/or commercialization of such licensed product or otherwise cured such breach. 
 Asset Purchase Agreement with Valo Health, Inc. 
 In March 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Valo Health Agreement, with Valo Health, Inc. (formerly known as Integral Health, Inc.), and, solely for purposes of certain sections, Valo Health Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Integral Health Holdings, LLC), or together with Valo Health, Inc., Valo Health, to divest our hit discovery capabilities. Pursuant to the Valo Health Agreement, Valo Health purchased certain assets, including specified intellectual property, from us in exchange for $17.5 million in cash, $2.5 million of which was paid at closing and the remaining $15.0 million which will be paid in incremental payments through June 2021, $0.5 million of reimbursements for expenses prepaid by us, the benefit of which was transferred to Valo Health, and $10.0 million of preferred equity in Valo’s next equity financing round or, if Valo Health’s next equity financing does not occur prior to the one-year anniversary of the Valo Health Agreement, a number of shares of preferred stock issued in Valo Health’s previous round of equity financing prior to the Valo Health Agreement equal to $10.0 million divided by the price per share paid by investors in that previous equity financing. We are also eligible to receive low single digit future royalties on the aggregate net sales of any products that bind to a target in certain identified target classes, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the period of time commencing at the time of the first commercial sale of such product in such country, until the later of (i) the expiration of certain related patents and (ii) ten years after such first commercial sale. The divestiture resulted in a reduction in headcount by 23 employees, which all transitioned to Valo Health. Concurrent with the divestiture, our Branford, Connecticut lease and certain revenue contracts were assigned to and assumed by Valo Health. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2020, Valo Health closed on their next equity financing round. In connection with the closing, we received preferred shares in Valo Health in an amount equal to $10.0 million and the remaining balance of incremental payments due.
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 31


If our product candidates, FT-4202 and FT-7051, are approved for the indications that we are currently targeting, they will likely compete with the currently marketed drugs and, if approved, the therapies in development discussed below. 
 Sickle Cell Disease 
 Approved drug treatments for SCD focus primarily on the management of anemia and reduction of VOCs. Until November 2019, there were only two drug treatments for SCD approved in the United States: HU and Endari. HU, marketed under trade names including DROXIA by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, as well as in generic form, is approved for the treatment of anemia related to SCD, to reduce the frequency of VOCs and the need for blood transfusions. Endari, marketed by Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., is an oral powder form of L-glutamine approved to reduce severe complications associated with the disorder. 
 In November 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Voxelotor, marketed by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., is an oral therapy taken once daily and is the first approved treatment that directly inhibits HbS polymerization. In addition, in November 2019, the FDA approved crizanlizumab, to reduce the frequency of VOCs in adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with SCD. Crizanlizumab, marketed by Novartis AG, is administered intravenously and binds to P-selectin, which is a cell adhesion protein that plays a central role in the multicellular interactions that can lead to vaso-occlusion. 
 Blood transfusions are also used to treat SCD and can transiently bolster hemoglobin levels by adding functional RBCs. There are a number of limitations associated with this therapeutic approach, including limited patient access and serious complications such as iron overload. The only potentially curative treatment currently approved for severe SCD is HSCT. However, this treatment option is not commonly used given the difficulties of finding a suitable matched donor and the risks associated with the treatment, which include an approximately 5% mortality rate. HSCT is more commonly offered to pediatric patients with available sibling-matched donors. 
 FT-4202 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches in development for patients with SCD. For example, Bluebird Bio, Inc., or bluebird, is developing LentiGlobin for the treatment of SCD. LentiGlobin is a one-time gene therapy treatment for SCD that aims to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into the patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo and then transplanting the modified stem cell into the patient’s bloodstream Another gene-editing approach in development for TDT and SCD, CTX001, is being developed under a co-development and co-commercialization agreement between CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. 
 
Imara Inc., or Imara, plans to initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial of IMR-687, a small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-9, for the treatment of SCD. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Agios, expects to initiate a global pivotal Phase III study of mitapivat in SCD in 2021. EpiDestiny, Inc., or EpiDestiny, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S, is evaluating EPI01, a small molecule designed to increase production of HbF, in Phase II clinical trials. Aruvant Sciences, Inc. is evaluating RVT-1801, a gene therapy, in a Phase I/II trial. Sangamo Therapeutics Inc., or Sangamo, in collaboration with Bioverativ Inc. (now Sanofi S.A.), or Bioverativ, is developing BIVV-003, a gene editing cell therapy that modifies cells to produce functional RBCs using HbF. 
 Thalassemia 
 Until November 2019, there were no approved drug therapies for beta thalassemia in the United States. The standard of care for many patients with beta thalassemia has been frequent blood transfusions to manage anemia. A potentially curative therapy for beta thalassemia is HSCT, which is associated with serious risk and is limited to patients with a suitable donor. 
 In November 2019, the FDA approved luspatercept-aamt for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular RBC transfusions. Luspatercept-aamt, marketed by Celgene and Acceleron Pharma Inc., is a modified receptor protein that promotes RBC maturation and increases overall RBC production, but does not address other cell types implicated in beta thalassemia. Luspatercept-aamt is not indicated for use as a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia. Luspatercept-aamt is dosed subcutaneously and is administered every three weeks in an outpatient setting.

FT-4202 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches that are in development as a therapeutic option for patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. 
 For example, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Bellicum, completed its Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating Rivo-cel, a modified donor T cell therapy to be used in conjunction with HSCT. Bellicum is expected to use results from this clinical trial to support Rivo-cel’s European MAA. Imara plans to initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial of IMR-687, a small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-9, for the treatment of beta thalassemia. EpiDestiny, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk A/S, is evaluating EPI01, a small molecule designed to increase production of HbF, in Phase II clinical trials. Orchard Therapeutics plc is conducting Phase II clinical trials of OTL-300, an autologous ex vivo gene therapy for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Sangamo, in collaboration with Bioverativ, is conducting a Phase I/II clinical trial of ST-400, which uses a genome-edited cell therapy approach designed to produce functional RBCs using HbF. CRISPR Therapeutics AG, in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, is conducting a Phase I/II clinical trial of CTX001, which uses a gene editing approach to upregulate the expression of HbF, in patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in collaboration with GBT, is using its gene control platform to identify and develop product candidates to activate gamma globin expression to induce the production of HbF for the treatment of beta thalassemia. 
 CBP/p300 in mCRPC 
 There are several companies seeking to develop CBP/p300 inhibitors, though only one has advanced to clinical trials. CellCentric, Ltd., or CellCentric, is currently running a Phase I/IIa study of its CBP/p300 inhibitor, CCS1477, to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity in patients with mCRPC or advanced solid tumors. 
 Roche/Genentech and Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Constellation, have disclosed additional CBP/p300 inhibitors, GNE-781 and GNE-049, arising from their collaboration. AbbVie, Inc., or AbbVie has also disclosed A-485, an inhibitor of CBP/p300 catalytic activity. None of these companies have entered clinical trials, and the development status remains unclear. Similar to the above, FT-7051 could also face competition from CellCentric’s CCS1477 inhibitor as CellCentric is planning to begin clinical trials in drug-resistant prostate cancer, AML, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
 Other development programs targeting mCRPC include ARV-110 from Arvinas, an investigational orally bioavailable protein degrader designed to selectively target and degrade the androgen receptor (AR), presently in Phase 1/2 trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). ESSA Pharma is developing EPI-7386, an investigational, oral, small molecule inhibitor of the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  
 Currently there is only one approved treatment targeting AML patients who have a susceptible IDH1 mutation. Agios markets Tibsovo for adult patients with newly-diagnosed AML who are 75 years old or older or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy and for adult patients with R/R AML. Another medicine is marketed for this patient population but does not require identification of the patient’s IDH1 mutation status. AbbVie and Genentech market Venclexta, which is a BCL-2 inhibitor indicated in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly-diagnosed AML in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing, as well as for clinical testing and commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. 
 FT-4202 is a stable, crystalline substance. Using the current route, several multi-kg batches (the largest being approximately 50 kg) of FT-4202 API have been manufactured to date. The drug product is a stable tablet, of which approximately 25,000 tablets have been manufactured to date in accordance with cGMP. 
 FT-7051 is a stable crystalline HCl salt, is moderately hygroscopic, and has pH-dependent solubility. Approximately 6 kg batch of FT-7051 API has been manufactured to date in accordance with cGMP. The drug product is stable capsule at three dose strengths.  Sufficient capsules have been manufactured to support Ph1 clinical study. As our current or future product candidates progress through preclinical studies and clinical trials 
 33


towards approval and commercialization, it is expected that various aspects of the manufacturing process will be altered in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes may require amendments to be made to regulatory applications which may further delay the timeframes under which modified manufacturing processes can be used for any of our current or future product candidates and additional bridging studies or trials may be required. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims in pending applications that may be allowed or the breadth of claims that may be enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority or derivation of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The term extension period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The extension period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the extension period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable 
 34


adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. 
 As of March 15, 2021, our overall patent portfolio includes more than 40 patent families comprising issued patents, provisional patent applications, and non-provisional patent applications. 
 FT-4202 
 As of March 15, 2021, we own multiple patent families related to our lead product candidate, FT-4202. The FT-4202 compound is covered through at least March 2038 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity) by granted patents in multiple jurisdictions including the U.S., Australia, European Patent Office, Japan, and South Korea, and by patent applications pending in numerous jurisdictions including the U.S., Canada and China. 
 FT-7051 
 As of March 15, 2021, we own multiple patent families related to our other product candidate, FT-7051. The FT-7051 compound is covered through at least June 2039 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity) by our granted patents in the U.S. and Japan, an allowed patent application in European Patent Office, and by patent applications pending in numerous jurisdictions including the U.S, Japan. 
 Other programs 
 As of March 15, 2021, we also own more than 10 patent families related to our isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) program (including olutasidenib), and our fatty-acid synthase (FASN) programs (FT-8225 and FT-4101). The olutasidenib compound is covered through at least September 2035 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity) by granted patents in the U.S., Europe, Japan, China and other countries. The olutasidenib drug product is covered by an additional granted U.S. patent, and by pending patent applications on the uses of olutasidenib in methods of treatment currently in clinical development, through at least May 2039, (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity). The FT-8225 compound is covered through at least October 2039 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity) by an issued U.S. patent and pending, U.S., European and PCT international patent applications. The FT-4101 compound is covered through at least March 2034 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity) by granted patents in the U.S. and Europe and other countries, as well as pending applications in some countries.
  In addition, we own certain FT-4101 pharmaceutical compositions that are covered by a granted U.S. patent and potential future national phase national phase filings from a pending PCT international patent application through at least October 2039 (not including any patent term extension, supplementary protection certificate, pediatric exclusivity, or other extension or data exclusivity).In addition, we own patents and patent applications expected to expire between 2034 and 2040 (if granted) protecting a variety of additional novel compounds discovered by our target discovery engine for multiple therapeutic targets including USP1, IDH1 CBP/p300, PKR, FASN, USP 9x and others. As of March 15, 2021, our patent portfolio covering these additional novel compounds discovered by our target discovery engine included more than 20 patent families. Patent term adjustments, SPC filings, or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates in various countries, while terminal disclaimers could result in earlier expiration dates in the U.S. 
 As indicated above, some of our owned patent applications are provisional patent applications. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. 
 35


While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, the patent application and approval process are expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. 
 We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. 
 For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”. 
 Other IP Rights 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, that such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”. 
Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, withdrawal of approvals, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 
The process required by the FDA before our product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 36


 
• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a NDA;
--+--------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Drugs 
 Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research patients will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 37


Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. 
  
• | Phase I—Phase I clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II—Phase II clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III—Phase III clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. 
 The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to 
 38


determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS program could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk-minimization tools. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 The FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage 
 39


in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers 
 Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or affects more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the U.S. of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs 
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures. 
 A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. 
 In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited 
 40


development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. 
 Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process. 
 Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III trial. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
 A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly 
 41


promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or withdrawal of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 Companion diagnostics identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the U.S., the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject 
 42


device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. 
 A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic. 
 Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies. 
Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject products to potential competition by lower-cost products and may reduce the profitability of products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs; address a new 
 43


methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; establish annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; and create a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing constitutional challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court, the former Trump Administration  issued various Executive Orders eliminating cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended, and we cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business especially given the new administration. 
 Other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted: 
  
• | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that CMS reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. For example, the former Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the former Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. The former Trump administration also previously released a “Blueprint” or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans 
 44


the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. While the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
In 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. In response, on October 1, 2020, FDA published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Under the final rule, States and Indian Tribes, and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers, may submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. Since the issuance of the final rule, several industry groups have filed federal lawsuits challenging multiple aspects of the final rule, and authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by States under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. Separately, the FDA also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Individual states in the U.S. have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability. 
 Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2023. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by 
 45


CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products. 
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory marketing 
 approval will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. 
 In the U.S., no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which may not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. 
 Finally, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing product pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU Member States’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, product candidates launched in some foreign countries such as some countries in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and prices generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 46


The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil monetary and criminal penalties, per kickback plus three times the amount of remuneration and a prison term per violation. Further, violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also form the basis for False Claims Act liability (discussed below). A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. On December 2, 2020, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, published further modifications to the AKS. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the AKS for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. This rule (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only government programs. 
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under FACA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of FACA can result in very significant monetary penalties, for each false claim and treble the amount of the government’s damages. Manufacturers can be held liable under FACA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal government continues to use FACA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations and prosecutions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S. Such investigations and prosecutions frequently involve, for example, the alleged promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under FACA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with FACA and other applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 We may be subject to the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Federal government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. 
 The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes a fraud and abuse provision referred to as the HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Law, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 47


California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General commenced enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
 We may also be subject to federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA and requires manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics, among others, to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Failure to disclose required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and/or other healthcare providers. 
 As noted above, analogous state laws and regulations, such as, state anti-kickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. There are also state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. 
 Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements 
 If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject.

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations 
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 Government Regulation of Drugs Outside of the United States 
 To market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, 
 marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area, or the EEA (comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 
  
• | Centralized procedure—If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of

submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.

• | National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Following authorization through either procedure, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

 In the EEA, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 Similar to as in the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on 
 50


GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, the centralized European Union portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation, through an independent audit. The regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data patients residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the U.S. or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. 
 There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which European Union pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the United Kingdom. This transition period is due to end on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. 
 Employees 
 As of March 15, 2021, we had 103 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. 32 of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees.
