ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes. Since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes, the ability to silence genes selectively through RNAi could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases. We believe that drugs that work through RNAi have the potential to become a broad new class of innovative medicines, and that this potential new drug class is similar to the opportunity created with other major biological discoveries such as recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. Using our intellectual property and expertise, we are developing what we believe to be a reproducible and modular platform to develop RNAi therapeutics for a variety of human diseases.
 Our research and development strategy is focused primarily on the use of our proprietary N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNAc-conjugate platform for delivery of small interfering RNAs, or “siRNAs” — the molecules that mediate RNAi — toward genetically validated, liver-expressed target genes involved in the cause or pathway of human diseases. We are also focused on clinical indications where there are high unmet needs, early biomarkers for the assessment of clinical activity in Phase 1 clinical studies, and a definable path for drug development, regulatory approval, patient access and commercialization.
 Specifically, our broad pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in three Strategic Therapeutic Areas, or “STArs:” Genetic Medicines, with multiple product candidates for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases, with product candidates directed toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases, with product candidates designed to address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases, beginning with hepatitis B and hepatitis D viral infections. We are focused on advancement of our Alnylam 2020 strategy for the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a potential new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, our goal is to achieve, by the end of 2020,  a company profile with three marketed products and ten RNAi therapeutic clinical programs, including four in late stages of development, across our three STArs.
 Our most advanced investigational RNAi therapeutic in development, patisiran, targets the transthyretin, or TTR, gene for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. We expect to report top-line data from our ongoing APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran in mid-2017. Assuming that the APOLLO data are positive, we plan to submit our first new drug application, or NDA, and marketing authorization application, or MAA, for patisiran by the end of 2017. We expect to advance additional investigational RNAi therapeutics into Phase 3 development during 2017, including fitusiran, for the treatment of hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders, and givosiran (ALN-AS1), for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias.  Given our plans for patisiran and the expected progress of our other late stage development programs, during 2016 we were focused on expanding our manufacturing, commercial and medical affairs capabilities to support our transition from a development-stage company toward a multi-product, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company.  For example, as a result of significant efforts in 2016, our manufacturing facility for patisiran formulated bulk drug product is now fully operational and ready for the potential launch of patisiran. In addition, we commenced construction of a manufacturing facility in Norton, Massachusetts for drug substance, including siRNAs and siRNA conjugates, for clinical and commercial use. We also expanded our global footprint with the establishment of our European headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, as well as the opening of a new development and commercial hub in Maidenhead, United Kingdom. Lastly, we continued to build our commercial and medical affairs teams in preparation for the potential launch of patisiran in 2018, which we plan to market in the United States, Canada and Western Europe.

Finally, based on our expertise in RNAi therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate, we have formed alliances with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to support our development and commercialization efforts, including Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, and The Medicines Company, or MDCO.  
 RNAi Therapeutics – A Potential New Class of Innovative Medicines
 RNAi is a natural biological pathway that occurs within cells to selectively silence the activity of specific genes. The discovery of RNAi first occurred in plants and worms in 1998, and two of the scientists who made this discovery, Dr. Andrew Fire and Dr. Craig Mello, received the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.
 RNAi therapeutics harness the natural RNAi pathway to silence disease-associated genes and knock down production of disease-causing proteins, representing the opportunity to create a potential new class of innovative medicines. This potential new drug class is similar to the opportunity created with other major biological discoveries such as recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. RNAi therapeutics also have a distinct mechanism of action, acting “upstream” of today’s medicines. Specifically, RNAi therapeutics achieve their biological effects through a highly potent, catalytic mechanism.  This unique mechanism of action confers a number of attributes that we believe have the potential to provide meaningful differentiation and distinct value for our investigational RNAi therapeutics relative to other drug classes.
 
 
 | Key Features of Alnylam Investigational RNAi Therapeutics Potential Attributes for Differentiation and Value 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Potential to silence any disease-associated gene, including so-called “undruggable” targets, where conventional therapeutic modalities (e.g., small molecule drugs and biologics) have not been successful
• | Demonstrated potential in clinical trials to achieve robust clinical activity with up to 99 percent target gene knockdown in some cases 
• | Clamped pharmacodynamic effect that has potential to provide improved and consistent efficacy compared with intermittent and transient effects often achieved with other drug classes 
• | Demonstrated durability of effect in clinical trials that enables once-monthly, once-quarterly and, in some cases, possible bi-annual dose regimens 
• | Ability to achieve subcutaneous dose administration with our proprietary GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform 
• | Potential for room temperature stability, avoiding the inconveniences, costs and global challenges of a cold chain distribution 

 We believe that the combination of these attributes represents a very promising profile for our investigational therapeutics, even in competitive markets.  We have reported on our advances in developing RNAi therapeutics as potential drugs in a large number of peer-reviewed publications and many scientific meetings, including publications by Alnylam scientists in the journals Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet.

 Delivery of RNAi Therapeutics
 In recent years, a tremendous amount of progress has been made in effectively delivering RNAi therapeutics to targeted organs and cells, and we believe Alnylam has been the leader of this advancement. This delivery success is now enabling execution on our product strategy and our Alnylam 2020 strategy.
 Early efforts focused on delivery of RNAi therapeutics utilizing lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, where siRNA molecules are encapsulated in specific lipid-based formulations. This technology enables systemic delivery with intravenous drug administration. Results with LNP-based investigational RNAi therapeutics demonstrate potent, rapid and durable target gene silencing in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Further, LNP-based investigational RNAi therapeutics have been found to be generally well tolerated in clinical studies conducted to date.  Our lead product, patisiran, is formulated utilizing LNPs.
 More recently, we began advancing proprietary technology that conjugates a sugar molecule called GalNAc to the siRNA molecule. This simpler delivery approach enables more convenient, subcutaneous administration of our drug candidates, a key aspect of our platform. Results from our Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform demonstrated a substantial increase in potency over our earlier “standard template chemistry” (STC)-GalNAc-conjugate approach in pre-clinical and clinical studies, and a durability of effect that we believe supports once-monthly, once-quarterly and in some cases, possibly even bi-annual subcutaneous dose regimens. Due to this increased potency and durability, as well as a wide therapeutic index, this conjugate platform has become our primary approach for development of investigational RNAi therapeutics.
 We have extensive human safety experience with our investigational RNAi therapeutics, with over 1,000 patients or volunteers dosed for up to three years of treatment in over ten clinical programs. Our data demonstrates that to date, RNAi therapeutics have been generally well tolerated with minimal platform-related safety findings. These findings, set forth below, occur at a low incidence and are monitorable. They are also generally asymptomatic and reversible even with continued dosing.  Based on data as of December 2016, these findings include: 
  
• | Low incidence (2.2 percent) of generally mild, asymptomatic, reversible liver function test increases greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or ULN
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low incidence (15.2 percent) of generally mild, transient injection site reactions, or ISRs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our view, this is an acceptable tolerability profile in the high unmet need indications that we pursue.
 In October 2016, we announced our decision to discontinue development of revusiran. Revusiran is an investigational therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis, which utilized our STC-GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform. Our decision followed the recommendation of the revusiran ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 study Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, to suspend dosing and the observation of an imbalance in mortality in revusiran-treated patients (N=17) as compared to those on placebo (N=2).  This breakdown has been updated since October 2016 to reflect data available to us as of December 2016.

We are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the revusiran data and expect this evaluation will take some time to complete, as uncertainty remains regarding the cause of the findings that led to the discontinuation of the revusiran program.  Findings as of December 2016 showed that mortality events in the ENDEAVOUR trial were concentrated in the study patients with more advanced, end-stage heart failure.
 Based on the ongoing evaluation there continues to be no evidence of any broader platform issue. The decision to discontinue development of revusiran did not affect patisiran or any of our other investigational RNAi therapeutic programs in development. The DMC for the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran met at our request following our decision to discontinue development of revusiran, and recommended continuation of the APOLLO Phase 3 trial without modification. 
 We believe RNAi therapeutics represent a simplified and efficient new class of investigational medicines. We have achieved human proof of concept in multiple clinical trials of our investigational candidates, providing strong support for our approach to drug development.  Moreover, we believe that our reproducible and modular platform will support our achievement of our 2020 strategy, such that by the end of 2020, we can grow into a multi-product commercial stage company with a deep and sustainable pipeline that can fuel continued growth for the future.
 Our Product Pipeline
 Our broad pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in three STArs: Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases. The following is a summary of our product development programs as of January 31, 2017, that identifies those programs in which we have achieved human proof of concept, or POC, by demonstrating target gene knockdown and/or additional evidence of activity in clinical studies, the development stage of our programs and our commercial rights to such programs:

We have spent substantial funds over the past three years to develop our product pipeline and expect to continue to do so in the future. We incurred research and development costs of $382.4 million in 2016, $276.5 million in 2015 and $190.2 million in 2014.

The investigational therapeutics described below are in various stages of clinical development and the scientific information included about these therapeutics is preliminary and investigative. None of Alnylam’s investigational therapeutics have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or any other health authority and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or efficacy of these therapeutics.
 Late Stage Clinical Development Programs
 Patisiran —  Hereditary TTR-Mediated Amyloidosis 
 Patisiran, our most advanced investigational RNAi therapeutic in development, targets the TTR gene for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis. hATTR amyloidosis is a progressively debilitating and often fatal disease caused by deposition of TTR in peripheral tissues. TTR protein is produced primarily in the liver and is normally a carrier of vitamin A. We believe TTR is a suitable target for an RNAi therapeutic formulated to maximize delivery to liver cells, which are the primary source of TTR synthesis. In hATTR amyloidosis, mutations in TTR result in the accumulation of damaging toxic deposits of the wild-type and mutant protein in several body organs and tissues, including the peripheral nervous system, heart and/or gastrointestinal tract. Our  hATTR amyloidosis program targets wild-type and all known mutant forms of TTR, including the V30M and V122I mutations, which are the major mutations of hATTR amyloidosis, and therefore it represents a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of all forms of hATTR amyloidosis.
 hATTR amyloidosis represents a major unmet medical need with significant morbidity and mortality as an orphan, or rare, disease. Based on our analysis of the available patient and market data, we estimate that hATTR amyloidosis affects approximately 50,000 people worldwide. An estimated 10,000 people are typically classified as having predominant polyneuropathy symptoms and an estimated 40,000 people are classified as having predominant cardiomyopathy symptoms. We believe that our APOLLO and ENDEAVOUR Phase 3 studies, which targeted patients with polyneuropathy symptoms and cardiomyopathy symptoms, respectively, demonstrated that there is significant overlap between the two symptomatic presentations. Over 50 percent of patients in APOLLO had cardiac involvement at baseline and a significant percentage of ENDEAVOUR patients had polyneuropathy symptoms at baseline.
 Patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis have a mean life expectancy of five to 15 years from symptom onset, and the only approved treatment options for early stage disease are liver transplantation and TTR stabilizers such as tafamidis, a small molecule stabilizer of the TTR protein that has been approved for hATTR amyloidosis patients with early stage polyneuropathy in the European Union, or EU, certain countries in Latin America and Japan, where it is approved for all stages of disease. In some countries, patients may also be treated with diflunisal, a commercially available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, which has been used off-label for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis. The mean survival for patients with cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis is approximately 2.5 to five years following diagnosis, and treatment is currently limited to supportive care. Although limited treatment options are available, there remains a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with hATTR amyloidosis.
 Our APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial for patisiran is ongoing and we expect to report top-line data from APOLLO in mid-2017. Assuming that the APOLLO data are positive, we expect to submit an NDA and MAA for patisiran by the end of 2017.
  
• | APOLLO Phase 3 Clinical Trial. In November 2013, we initiated our ongoing APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial of patisiran. The APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients. The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in the change in the modified composite Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS), termed “mNIS+7,” between patisiran and placebo at 18 months. The mNIS+7 score is an evaluation of muscle weakness, sensory and autonomic function, and nerve conductance across a 304-point scale, where neuropathy progression leads to an increased score over time. Secondary endpoints include: the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) score; Neuropathy Impairment Score, or NIS-weakness; modified body mass index, or mBMI; timed ten-meter walk; and the COMPASS-31 autonomic symptom score. The trial was designed to enroll 200 hATTR amyloidosis patients with a baseline NIS in the range of five to 130, which represents patients with Stage 1 or Stage 2 familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, or FAP. Patients were randomized two-to-one, patisiran-to-placebo, with patisiran administered at 0.30 mg/kg once every three weeks for 18 months by intravenous infusion. The study was designed with 90 percent power to conservatively detect as little as a 37.5 percent difference in change in mNIS+7 between treatment groups, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The placebo mNIS+7 progression rate was derived from an Alnylam analysis of natural history data from 283 hATTR amyloidosis patients. Patients completing the APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial are eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 open-label extension, or OLE, study, called the APOLLO-OLE. In January 2016, we completed enrollment in our APOLLO study with a total of 225 hATTR amyloidosis patients with Stage 1 or Stage 2 disease, significantly exceeding the original anticipated enrollment of 200.

• | Phase 2 OLE Clinical Trial. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of patisiran. Patients participating in the Phase 2 study were eligible to participate in a Phase 2 OLE study with patisiran. The ongoing patisiran Phase 2 OLE study is an open-label, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of patisiran administration. Patisiran is being administered once every three weeks at a dose of 0.30 mg/kg by intravenous infusion. The study is measuring a number of clinical endpoints every six months, including mNIS+7. In July 2016, we reported preliminary 24-month clinical data from this ongoing Phase 2 OLE study. The results for patients (N=24) who reached the 24-month endpoint as of a data cut off of May 12, 2016 showed a mean decrease of 6.7 points from baseline in mNIS+7 after 24 months of treatment. This compares favorably to an estimated mean increase (worsening) in mNIS+7 of 26 to 30 points at 24 months based upon analyses of historical data sets in untreated patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis with similar baseline neurologic impairment. Similar results were seen in patients with or without concomitant use of TTR tetramer stabilizers. In a new analysis, over 70 percent of patients showed either improvement or no change in mNIS+7 at 24 months. In addition, patisiran administration was associated with statistically significant mean improvements in nerve fiber density from sweat gland biopsy samples from both the distal thigh and distal leg (p less than 0.01 for both), as read histologically in a blinded manner by a central lab. Over the 24-month period, hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy with associated cardiac involvement (N=11) showed stability in their cardiac biomarkers, echocardiographic measures, and 10-meter walk test (i.e., gait speed). Serum TTR levels were also measured throughout the Phase 2 OLE study, and showed serum TTR reduction of up to 97 percent, a mean maximal reduction of 93 percent, and a mean reduction of 84 percent at 24 months. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In July 2016, we also presented the results of an exploratory analysis examining the relationship between the degree of serum TTR reduction with subsequent changes in mNIS+7. In the analysis, the degree of TTR reduction on Day 17 after the first dose of patisiran was compared to changes in mNIS+7 at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. There was a positive correlation between the degree of serum TTR reduction and changes in mNIS+7. Specifically, greater degrees of TTR reduction resulted in greater levels of mNIS+7 improvement. 
 In the Phase 2 OLE study, patisiran administration was found to be generally well tolerated in patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis out to 25 months, with no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported through the data transfer date. The most common drug-related or possibly drug-related adverse events, or AEs, were flushing (22.2 percent) and infusion-related reactions (18.5 percent), all of which were mild in severity and did not result in any discontinuations. There were nine reports of SAEs in six patients, all of which were unrelated to study drug, including two deaths as previously reported. There were no clinically significant changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters, including platelet counts.
 We expect to report 36-month data from the patisiran Phase 2 OLE study in late 2017.
 The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the EMA has designated patisiran as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. In addition, the FDA provided Orphan Drug Designation to patisiran as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis.  The FDA has also granted Fast Track designation to patisiran for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
 In January 2014, we entered into the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration, which is an exclusive relationship for the worldwide development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics in the field of Genetic Medicines, which includes our current and future Genetic Medicine programs that reach human proof-of-principal study completion, or Human POP, by the end of 2019, subject to extension to the end of 2021 in various circumstances.  Under this collaboration, we are leading development and commercialization of patisiran in the United States, Canada and Western Europe while Sanofi Genzyme will develop and commercialize the product in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 Fitusiran — Hemophilia and Rare Bleeding Disorders
 Fitusiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin, or AT, for the treatment of hemophilia A and B and rare bleeding disorders, or RBD. Fitusiran is designed to lower levels of AT with the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia and RBD. AT, also known as "antithrombin III" and "SERPINC1," is a liver expressed plasma protein and member of the “serpin” family of proteins that acts by inactivating thrombin and other coagulation factors. AT plays a key role in normal hemostasis by helping to limit the process of fibrin clot formation. However, in hemophilia, insufficient thrombin generation results in impaired fibrin clot formation. Lowering AT in the hemophilia setting may promote the generation of sufficient levels of thrombin needed to form an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding. This rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that co-inheritance of thrombophilic mutations, including AT deficiency, may ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia. We believe this approach is a unique and innovative strategy for preventing bleeding in people with hemophilia.

Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by recurrent bleeding episodes, typically into the joints and muscles. Recurrent bleeding into joints results in arthritis and joint damage, reducing mobility and often requiring joint replacement surgeries. There are approximately 200,000 persons diagnosed with hemophilia worldwide. Hemophilia A, or HA, is defined by loss-of-function mutations in factor VIII and hemophilia B, or HB, is defined by a loss-of-function mutation in factor IX. In patients with hemophilia, a deficiency in plasma proteins factor VIII or factor IX prevents the generation of thrombin to levels that are sufficient to prevent or stop bleeding. Other RBD are defined by deficiencies of blood coagulation factors, including Factors II, V, VII, X and XI. Based on our analysis of the available patient and market data, we estimate that there are approximately 1,000 persons worldwide with a severe bleeding phenotype because of these conditions. The goal of treatment for persons living with hemophilia is to prevent bleeding, establish prompt management of bleeds, and manage the complications of bleeding and treatment. Current guidelines recommend management of hemophilia with regular intravenous infusions of recombinant or human-derived clotting factors. The most serious treatment-related complication is the development of antibodies, known as inhibitors, to replacement factor. Inhibitor development can occur in both HA and HB, impacting as many as one-third of people with severe HA, and persons in this inhibitor subset become refractory to standard replacement therapy. There exists a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat people living with hemophilia and RBD. 
 We believe fitusiran has the potential to prevent bleeding in severe HA and HB patients and in patients with other RBD.  We are evaluating fitusiran in an ongoing Phase 1 study in HA and HB patients, with and without inhibitors, as well as in a Phase 2 OLE study. We plan to initiate our ATLAS Phase 3 program in early 2017. Subject to continued diligence and health authority feedback, the ATLAS program is expected to consist of three separate Phase 3 clinical trials: ATLAS-INH in severe HA and HB patients with inhibitors; ATLAS-A/B in severe HA and HB patients without inhibitors; and, ATLAS-PPX in severe HA and HB patients with or without inhibitors, switching from prophylactic factor or bypassing agent therapy to fitusiran prophylaxis.
  
• | Phase 1/Phase 2 OLE Clinical Trials. The ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of fitusiran is a single- and multi-dose, dose-escalation study comprised of four parts. Part A - which is complete - was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation study (N=4 per cohort; 3:1 randomization of drug:placebo) in healthy volunteers. This part of the study was completed after the first dose cohort received a single subcutaneous dose of fitusiran at 30 micrograms per kilogram, or mcg/kg. Part B of the study - which is also complete - was an open-label, multi-dose, dose-escalation study that enrolled 12 patients with severe HA or HB. Patients in Part B received three weekly subcutaneous injections of fitusiran at doses of 15, 45, or 75 mcg/kg. Part C of the study - which has completed dosing - is an open-label, multi-dose, dose escalation study that enrolled 18 patients with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors. Twelve patients in Part C received three monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at doses of 225, 450, 900, or 1800 mcg/kg. In addition, six patients in Part C received three fixed monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at 80 mg. Part D of the study is designed to enroll up to 18 patients with inhibitors. Patients in Part D received three fixed monthly subcutaneous doses of fitusiran at 50 mg or 80 mg. The primary objective of Parts B, C, and D of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of subcutaneously administered fitusiran in patients with hemophilia, with and without inhibitors. Secondary objectives include assessment of clinical activity as determined by lowering of plasma AT levels and increase in thrombin generation at pharmacologic doses of fitusiran. In addition, exploratory analyses of bleeding are being performed.

 Patients with and without inhibitors who complete dosing in the Phase 1 trial are eligible to roll over into the fitusiran Phase 2 OLE study.
  
o | Phase 1 Data – HA and HB Patients with Inhibitors. In December 2016, we reported interim results, as of the data cut-off date of October 6, 2016, from Part D of our ongoing fitusiran Phase 1 study in patients with HA or HB with inhibitors who were enrolled in two separate dose cohorts of 50 mg, once-monthly (N=6) or 80 mg, once-monthly (N=10). Treatment with fitusiran resulted in potent and dose-dependent lowering of AT and increases in thrombin generation. In an exploratory analysis of bleeding events, a median annualized bleeding rate, or ABR, of zero was achieved for patients in combined dose cohorts in the observation period, compared to the pre-study median ABR of 31.

o | Phase 2 OLE Data – HA and HB Patients without Inhibitors. In December 2016, we reported results, as of the data cut-off date of October 6, 2016, from our ongoing Phase 2 fitusiran OLE study in 16 HA or HB patients without inhibitors. All patients were previously enrolled in the fitusiran Phase 1 study, receiving 3 weekly or 3 monthly subcutaneous doses ranging from 45 mcg/kg to 1800 mcg/kg. In the Phase 2 OLE study, fitusiran was administered subcutaneously once-monthly at two fixed dose levels, 50 mg (N=8) and 80 mg (N=8), with patients receiving up to 14 months of continuous dosing. Both dose levels achieved mean AT lowering of approximately 80 percent and mean increases in thrombin generation levels approaching the lower end of the range observed in normal healthy individuals in Part A of the Phase 1 study. In an exploratory post hoc analysis of bleed events, fitusiran achieved a median overall ABR of 1.0, over a median observation period of 5.7 months, compared to a median pre-study ABR of 4.0.

o | Safety. As of the data cut-off date of October 6, 2016, a total of 41 HA or HB patients were exposed to fitusiran in our ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 OLE studies. Fitusiran was generally well tolerated with the longest period of exposure of up to 14 months of continuous treatment. There were no drug-related SAEs and no thromboembolic events or laboratory evidence of pathologic clot formation through the data cut-off date. One non-inhibitor patient discontinued due to an AE described as non-cardiac chest pain considered severe and possibly related to study drug. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with the most common AEs consisting of mild ISRs in 17 patients (41 percent). Asymptomatic and reversible alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, increases greater than three times ULN, without concurrent elevations in bilirubin greater than two times ULN, were observed in seven patients (17 percent); six of these patients had a medical history of hepatitis C infection. All breakthrough bleed events were successfully managed with standard replacement factor or bypassing agents.

Fitusiran has received Orphan Drug Designation for HA and HB in the United States and the EU.
 In September 2015, Sanofi Genzyme elected to opt into a regional license for fitusiran and began funding the program under the regional license terms in January 2016.  In November 2016, Sanofi Genzyme elected to expand its regional rights and opt-in to co-develop and co-commercialize fitusiran in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, in addition to developing and commercializing the product in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory. In connection with the exercise of this right, Sanofi Genzyme paid us in January 2017 for their incremental share of co-development costs incurred from January 2016 to September 2016 in accordance with the 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.” 
 Inclisiran (ALN-PCSsc) — Hypercholesterolemia
 Inclisiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, or PCSK9, for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a protein involved in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor, or LDL receptor, levels on hepatocytes and the metabolism of LDL cholesterol, or LDL-C, which is commonly referred to as “bad” cholesterol. PCSK9 is produced by the liver and circulates in the bloodstream. Both intracellular and extracellular PCSK9 reduce the liver’s capacity to absorb LDL-C by decreasing LDL receptor levels. Published case reports have shown individuals with loss-of-function genetic mutations in PCSK9 have decreased blood cholesterol levels and a dramatically reduced risk of coronary artery disease, or CAD, including myocardial infarction or heart attack. 
 Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood which is known to increase the risk of CAD, the leading cause of death in the United States. Some forms of hypercholesterolemia can be treated through dietary restrictions, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise and smoking cessation) and medicines such as statins. However, many patients with hypercholesterolemia are unable to lower their LDL-C to a level which reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events with lifestyle modifications and statins alone. In addition, high-risk subpopulations such as familial hypercholesterolemia patients, acute coronary syndrome patients and other statin intolerant patients often have residual risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that would benefit from more efficacious treatment. Severe forms of hypercholesterolemia are estimated to affect millions of patients worldwide, and as a result, there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia whose disease is inadequately managed by existing therapies.
 In February 2013, we and MDCO entered into a license and collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted to MDCO an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we were responsible for conducting certain pre-clinical studies, as well as the Phase 1 clinical study of inclisiran, and MDCO is responsible for leading and funding development from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement with MDCO, the development leadership of inclisiran has now transferred from us to MDCO. A description of our agreement with MDCO is included below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”
 MDCO is conducting ORION-1, an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of inclisiran.  In addition, in January 2017, MDCO announced the initiation of the ORION-2 study of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH, as well as the ORION-3 study, which is a Phase 2 OLE cross-over study for patients completing the ongoing ORION-1 study.  Based on interim results from ORION-1, MDCO has announced its intention to progress inclisiran into Phase 3 development.
  
• | ORION-1 Phase 2 Clinical Trial. In November 2016, we and MDCO reported positive initial data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of inclisiran, known as ORION-1, being conducted by MDCO. Among 189 randomized and treated patients who had been followed for 180 days or more by the interim data cut-off date of October 25, 2016, a single 300 mg subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 59 percent at Day 60, which were durable to Day 90 (mean 50 percent) and Day 180 (mean 43

percent and up to 81 percent). Two 300 mg injections of inclisiran - one given on Day 1 and one on Day 90 - achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 57 percent at Day 120, which was durable to Day 180 (mean 52 percent and up to 81 percent). All differences relative to placebo in these 189 patients were statistically significant (p < 0.0001).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Inclisiran represents the largest safety experience for one of our investigational RNAi therapeutics to date.  As of the data cut-off date of October 25, 2016 (N=501), inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no significant elevations of liver enzymes considered related to study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function. The overall incidence of treatment emergent AEs was 54 percent both in patients randomized to placebo and in patients randomized to inclisiran, with no differences between inclisiran doses. ISRs with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 3.2 percent of patients), mild or moderate, and transient. One fatal myocardial infarction was reported as unrelated to study drug, and one patient with ALT greater than three times ULN was attributed to concomitant statin use.
 In January 2017, MDCO reported positive top-line results from its interim analysis with Day 180 follow-up for all 501 patients enrolled in the ORION-1 Phase 2 study.  As reported by MDCO, in the interim analysis, inclisiran continued to demonstrate significant and durable LDL-C reduction, supporting the potential for a low-volume dosing regimen of two or three injections per year. Inclisiran was well tolerated and no material safety issue, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes, neuropathy or change in renal function, was observed.  ISRs with inclisiran were infrequent, mild or moderate, and transient.
 Data from our Phase 1 study of inclisiran were published in the New England Journal of Medicine Jan. 2017.  
 Early Stage Clinical Development Programs
 Givosiran — Acute Hepatic Porphyrias
 Givosiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinate synthase-1, or ALAS-1, for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias, or AHPs. The porphyrias are a family of rare metabolic disorders predominately caused by a genetic mutation in one of the eight enzymes responsible for heme biosynthesis. AHPs constitute a subset of porphyrias that are characterized by acute neurovisceral attacks and in some instances, skin manifestations. The enzyme deficiency in AHP occurs within the liver, and includes acute intermittent porphyria, or AIP, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria and hereditary delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency which is extremely rare. The initial focus of the givosiran program is on AIP, the most common AHP, which is an ultra-rare disease caused by loss of function mutations in porphobilinogen deaminase, or PBGD, that can result in the upstream accumulation of toxic heme intermediates, including aminolevulinic acid, or ALA, and porphobilinogen, or PBG. Exposure of AIP patients to certain drugs, dieting or hormonal changes can trigger strong induction of ALAS-1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, which can lead to accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates that precipitate disease symptoms. Patients with one of the AHPs can have acute and/or recurrent attacks that are characterized by severe abdominal pain, paresis or paralysis, neuropsychiatric manifestations, cutaneous lesions and, in some instances, death if untreated or if treatment is delayed. In addition, more than 50 percent of AHP patients report chronic porphyria symptoms, most commonly pain, while not having acute attacks.  
 It is estimated that approximately 5,000 patients in the United States and Europe suffer sporadic AIP attacks annually, and approximately 1,000 patients are afflicted with recurrent, debilitating attacks. The only approved treatments for acute attacks are preparations of heme derived from human blood. Heme requires administration through a large vein or central venous catheter and is associated with a number of side effects including thrombophlebitis, coagulation abnormalities, headaches and hypersensitivity reactions. While heme is not approved for prophylactic use (i.e., the prevention of acute attacks), it is sometimes used in this manner in patients who experience recurrent attacks. Chronic administration of heme has been found to result in renal insufficiency, iron overload, systemic infections (due to the requirement for central venous access) and, in some instances, tachyphylaxis. In addition, given the short half-life of hemin (10.8 hours), its beneficial effect on the toxic precursors ALA and PBG is short lived.  As a result, patients may require hemin infusions as frequently as bi-weekly and often have significant chronic symptoms in between infusions. There is a clear unmet need for new therapies for AIP that could be both safer and more effective and more convenient to administer than available therapies.
 Givosiran has the potential to be a prophylactic approach for the prevention of recurrent attacks, as well as a therapy for the treatment of acute porphyria attacks. We are evaluating givosiran in an ongoing Phase 1 study and expect to present additional data from Part C of this study in mid-2017.  We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial for givosiran in late 2017, subject to communications with regulatory authorities.
  
• | Phase 1 Givosiran Study. The Phase 1 study is being conducted in three parts. Parts A and B, which have completed dosing, were randomized (3:1, drug:placebo), single-blind, single-dose (Part A) and multi-dose (Part B), dose-escalation studies, designed to enroll up to a total of 40 “asymptomatic high excreter,” or ASHE, subjects with a

defined mutation in the PBGD gene and elevated urinary levels of ALA and PBG, but no current porphyria attacks. The primary objective of Parts A and B was to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of givosiran. Secondary objectives included evaluation of clinical activity for givosiran as measured by reduction in plasma and urinary levels of ALA and PBG. Exploratory objectives include the impact of givosiran on liver ALAS-1 messenger RNA, or mRNA, as measured from serum or urinary exosomal mRNA preparations. Part C, initiated in February 2016, is a randomized (3:1, drug:placebo), double-blind, multi-dose study in up to 20 AIP patients who experience recurrent porphyria attacks. Patients are initially followed in a three-month run-in phase, where the number and frequency of porphyria attacks and levels of ALA and PBG are measured prospectively. Patients who experience at least one porphyria attack during the run-in phase are then eligible to enter the six-month treatment phase of the study, where they are randomized to receive two once-quarterly doses or four once-monthly doses of placebo or givosiran. During the treatment phase, the effects of placebo or givosiran on the number and frequency of porphyria attacks, as well as on the levels of ALA and PBG, are measured prospectively and then compared to run-in phase results. Additional measures include safety, tolerability, hospitalizations, use of hemin, levels of ALAS-1 mRNA, and givosiran pharmacokinetics. Following the treatment phase, all patients are eligible to receive givosiran in an OLE study. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We reported interim data from Parts A and B of our Phase 1 study in September 2016. Results as of the data transfer date of June 28, 2016 showed that givosiran administration resulted in rapid, dose-dependent and durable silencing of liver ALAS-1 mRNA in both Part A (N=20) and Part B (N=8) of the trial.  In addition, data showed rapid and dose-dependent lowering of ALA and PBG of up to 95 percent.  Reductions in ALA and PBG were highly durable, with effects lasting for over ten months after a single dose.  Givosiran continued to be generally well tolerated in ASHE subjects as of the data transfer date.  There were three SAEs that were all deemed to be unlikely related to study drug.  With the exception of one AE that was severe and unrelated to study drug, all other AEs were mild or moderate in severity, most commonly including abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, nasopharyngitis, pruritis and rash.  There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory parameters, or physical examination.
 In December 2016, we reported positive initial clinical activity results for givosiran from Cohorts 1 and 2 of Part C of our Phase 1 study. Data included unblinded results for Cohort 1 (N=4, 2.5 mg/kg given once-quarterly) and aggregated, blinded results for Cohort 2 (N=4, 2.5 mg/kg given once-monthly) given that the patients in Cohort 2 were still in the treatment phase of the study. Consistent with results in ASHE patients, givosiran administration resulted in robust and durable lowering of ALA and PBG. In Cohort 1, givosiran administration resulted in meaningful reductions in the number and frequency of porphyria attacks. Specifically, as compared with the run-in phase, there was a 74 percent mean decrease in the annualized attack rate and a 75 percent mean reduction in annualized hemin administration. In addition, the maximum attack-free interval (i.e., the greatest period of time between porphyria attacks) was a mean of approximately 10.5 times that observed during the run-in phase. Favorable treatment effects in all three parameters were seen in each of the givosiran-treated patients. In contrast, the single placebo patient in Cohort 1 showed a generally similar number and frequency of porphyria attacks and a generally similar amount of hemin usage during the run-in and treatment phases. Finally, the aggregated blinded data for Cohort 2 patients, with approximately three months of treatment phase data, provided additional evidence of clinical activity. Specifically, as compared with the run-in phase, Cohort 2 patients receiving placebo or givosiran showed a 50 percent mean reduction in annualized attack rate and a 76 percent mean reduction in annualized hemin doses administered; the maximum attack-free interval was a mean of approximately 2.4 times that observed during the run-in phase.
 As of the data transfer on November 7, 2016, there were no drug-related SAEs reported in Cohorts 1-4.  In Cohort 3, which remains blinded, one death was reported after the data transfer date due to acute pancreatitis, complicated by a pulmonary embolism; the death was considered to be unlikely related to givosiran or placebo by the investigator and the study’s Safety Review Committee.  In Cohorts 1 and 2, there were no discontinuations due to AEs.  Possibly or definitely related AEs reported in two or more cases were ISRs and myalgia; all of these events were mild. There were no other clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory parameters or physical examination.
 Givosiran has received Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and the EU for the treatment of AHPs.  
 During 2016, Sanofi Genzyme elected not to opt into the development and commercialization of givosiran in the Sanofi Genzyme Territory, providing us with full global control of the program for further development and commercialization, if approved. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration is described below under the heading “Strategic Alliances.”

Other Early Stage Clinical Programs
 ALN-CC5 — Complement-Mediated Diseases
  
• | Subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the complement pathway for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. The complement system plays a central role in immunity as a protective mechanism for host defense, but its dysregulation results in life-threatening complications in a broad range of human diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or aHUS, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica and membranous nephropathy, amongst others. Complement component 5, which is predominantly expressed in liver cells, is a genetically and clinically validated target.

• | Dosing completed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The Phase 1/2 trial was conducted in three parts. Parts A and B were randomized (3:1, drug:placebo), double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, studies, respectively, which enrolled 56 healthy adult volunteers. These parts of the study were designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of ALN-CC5. In December 2016, we reported new results from Part C of the Phase 1/2 trial, which provided evidence that ALN-CC5-mediated knockdown of serum C5 has the potential to enable effective sparing of dose level and frequency of eculizumab in patients with PNH. As of the data transfer date of October 13, 2016, results showed that PNH patients who had previously been naive to eculizumab (N=3) achieved sustained control of disease hemolysis by achieving normalization of LDH to less than or at approximately 1.5 times ULN for up to six months while on a spared eculizumab regimen of 600 mg every four weeks (normal dose for eculizumab 900 mg every two weeks). For patients who entered the study on background eculizumab (N=3), effective disease control with normalization of LDH to less than or at approximately 1.5 times ULN was achieved for up to five months while on a spared regimen of 900 mg eculizumab dosed every four weeks. Using an assay for eculizumab plasma levels, both sparing regimens achieved stable eculizumab trough levels greater than 100 mcg/mL during the five to six month period.

• | ALN-CC5 generally well tolerated in patients with PNH after multiple doses for up to 16 weeks of dosing. As of the data transfer date of October 13, 2016, there were no SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs in the study, and the majority of reported AEs were mild or moderate in severity. One patient had a mild injection site reaction which was deemed possibly or definitely related to study drug, and one patient had a severe AE reported as hepatoxicity, which was asymptomatic grade 3 transaminitis, transient and without increase in total bilirubin. Further, under the ongoing pharmacodynamic effects of ALN-CC5, the transaminase elevations returned to baseline and the patient remained in the study.

ALN-GO1 — Primary Hyperoxaluria 1
  
• | Subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic, for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, or PH1, an ultra-rare inherited orphan disease in which the lack of a particular liver enzyme causes the body to produce excess amounts of a substance called oxalate. This leads to a buildup of insoluble calcium oxalate, causing kidney failure and further organ damage for some patients in infancy and most patients by their mid-twenties. About 50 percent of patients will have kidney failure by age 15, and about 80 percent will have end stage renal disease by age 30. ALN-GO1 targets the gene for glycolate oxidase, GO, an enzyme that works upstream of the defect in PH1 patients, and is designed to starve the pathway of substrate for oxalate production with the goal of preventing its associated pathology. Current treatment options are very limited, and include frequent renal dialysis or combined organ transplantation of liver and kidneys, a procedure with high morbidity that is limited due to organ availability. Although a small minority of patients respond to vitamin B6 supplementation, there are no approved pharmaceutical therapies for PH1.

• | Dosing in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial ongoing. Part A is a single-dose study that enrolled 32 healthy adult volunteers. Part B will be a multi-dose study designed to enroll up to a total of 20 patients with PH1. The primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of ALN-GO1. In September 2016, we reported initial data (N=32) as of the data transfer dates on August 17, 2016 (for safety) and September 2, 2016 (for pharmacodynamic activity). ALN-GO1 administration resulted in dose-dependent and statistically significant (nominal two-sided p values less than 0.05) increases from baseline in plasma and urinary glycolate as compared to placebo, with up to an 8-fold increase in plasma glycolate in the highest dose cohort. The effects of ALN-GO1 were highly durable, with levels sustained through 85 days at the highest dose, supportive of a once-monthly and possibly once-quarterly subcutaneous dose regimen.

• | Single doses of ALN-GO1 were shown to be generally well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. There were no SAEs reported. AEs were reported in 88 percent (N=21) of ALN-GO1 treated subjects and 63 percent (N=5) of placebo treated subjects. Common AEs occurring in greater than 10 percent of ALN-GO1 treated subjects included nasopharyngitis (N=6), headache (N=5), and transient injection site pain (N=4). All AEs were mild to moderate with the exception of one subject in the lowest dose cohort who had transient, asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase elevation which was unrelated to study drug.

 ALN-TTRsc02 —  TTR-Mediated Amyloidosis
  
• | Subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis; represents an extension of our program for ATTR amyloidosis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers ongoing. Data (N=48) reported in December 2016 demonstrated that single subcutaneous doses of ALN-TTRsc02 achieved robust serum TTR reduction of up to 98.4 percent (mean max of 97.1 ± 0.5 percent), with durability for well over four months. At a dose of 50 mg, ALN-TTRsc02 achieved a mean TTR reduction at day 90 of 86.2 percent. Based on these results, we believe that a once-quarterly, fixed dose of 25 to 50 mg of ALN-TTRsc02 could achieve clamped and potentially clinically-meaningful reductions of TTR exceeding 80 percent. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers, with no SAEs and no discontinuations due to AEs. All AEs reported were mild or moderate in severity and included transient ISRs (redness and pain), pruritus, cough, nausea, fatigue and abdominal pain. No clinically significant changes were reported in hematologic or laboratory parameters (e.g., liver function tests), vital signs or physical exams.

 ALN-HBV — Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
  
• | Subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic, ALN-HBV, targeting the hepatitis B virus, or HBV, genome for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Chronic HBV infection is the most common serious liver infection in the world. Worldwide, two billion people (one out of three people) have been infected with HBV and an estimated 240 - 290 million people have become chronically infected. The clinical manifestations are severe. Nearly 25 percent of chronic HBV patients develop serious liver diseases such as cirrhosis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An estimated one million people die each year from HBV infection and its complications worldwide; about 5,000 of those are in the United States. Despite the use of nucleoside analog inhibitors of viral DNA synthesis and interferon therapies, the cure rate for chronic HBV infection is less than ten percent. Reduction in HBV surface antigen, or HBsAg, levels of over 0.5 log10 is the single best predictor of immunologic cure. We believe an RNAi therapeutic

inhibiting all steps of the HBV life cycle and silencing tolerogenic viral antigens has the potential to achieve a “functional cure.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1/2 randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study is ongoing. Part A is a single-dose study designed to enroll up to a total of 24 normal healthy volunteers. Part B will be a single-dose study designed to enroll up to a total of 28 patients with chronic HBV infection. Part C will be a multi-dose study designed to enroll up to a total of 48 patients with chronic HBV infection. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple subcutaneous doses of ALN-HBV. Our ALN-HBV program derives from our 2014 acquisition of the RNAi assets of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, including Sirna Therapeutics, Inc., or Sirna.

Our Collaboration and Licensing Strategy
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutic products directed towards our three STArs: Genetic Medicines; Cardio-Metabolic Diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Diseases. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, collaboration and licensing agreements as a means of obtaining resources, capabilities and funding to advance our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
 Our collaboration strategy is to form alliances that create significant value for ourselves and our collaborators in the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a potential new class of innovative medicines. Specifically, with respect to our Genetic Medicine pipeline, we formed a broad strategic alliance with Sanofi Genzyme in 2014 pursuant to which we retain development and commercial rights for our current and future Genetic Medicine products in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, and Sanofi Genzyme will develop and commercialize our current and future Genetic Medicine products for which it elects to opt-in, in the rest of the world, subject to certain broader rights. With respect to our Cardio-Metabolic and Hepatic Infectious Disease pipelines, we intend to seek future strategic alliances for these programs, while retaining significant product development and commercialization rights. We currently have a global alliance with MDCO for the development and commercialization of our inclisiran program.
 We also have entered into license agreements to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of RNAi. In addition, because delivery of RNAi therapeutics has historically been an important objective of our research activities, we have entered into various collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies, including various LNP delivery technologies. 
 Strategic Alliances
 We have formed, and intend to continue to form, strategic alliances to gain access to the financial, technical, clinical and commercial resources necessary to develop and market RNAi therapeutics. We expect these alliances to provide us with financial support in the form of upfront cash payments, license fees, equity investments, research, development, and sales and marketing funding, milestone payments and/or royalties or profit sharing based on sales of RNAi therapeutics. Below is a brief description of our key strategic alliance and license agreements. 
Product Alliances.
 Sanofi Genzyme.    In January 2014, we entered into a global, strategic collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics as Genetic Medicines to treat orphan diseases. The 2014 Sanofi Genzyme collaboration is structured as an exclusive relationship for the worldwide development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics in the field of Genetic Medicines, which includes our current and future Genetic Medicine programs that reach Human POP by the end of 2019, subject to extension to the end of 2021 in various circumstances. We will retain product rights in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, referred to as the Alnylam Territory, while Sanofi Genzyme will obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize collaboration products in the rest of the world, referred to as the Sanofi Genzyme Territory, together with certain broader co-development/co-commercialize or worldwide rights for certain products. Sanofi Genzyme’s rights are structured as an opt-in that is triggered upon achievement of Human POP. We maintain development control for all programs prior to Sanofi Genzyme’s opt-in and maintain development and commercialization control after Sanofi Genzyme’s opt-in for all programs in the Alnylam Territory.
 Upon the closing of the equity transaction in February 2014, we sold to Sanofi Genzyme 8,766,338 shares of our common stock and Sanofi Genzyme paid $700.0 million in aggregate cash consideration to us. As a condition to the closing of the equity transaction, Sanofi Genzyme entered into an investor agreement with us containing provisions regarding Sanofi Genzyme’s holding and “standstill” obligations, additional purchase, voting and registration rights, as well as certain other rights and obligations of the parties.

 The Medicines Company.    In February 2013, we and MDCO entered into a license and collaboration agreement pursuant to which we granted to MDCO an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases.  Under the MDCO agreement, we had responsibility for the development of inclisiran until Phase 1 Completion, as defined in the MDCO agreement, at our cost. In late 2015, MDCO assumed responsibility for all development and commercialization of inclisiran, at its sole cost, and is advancing inclisiran into late stage development. For more information regarding the MDCO agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Platform Alliances.
 Monsanto Company.    In August 2012, we and Monsanto Company, or Monsanto, entered into a license and collaboration agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Monsanto a worldwide, exclusive, royalty bearing right and license, including the right to grant sublicenses, to our RNAi platform technology and intellectual property controlled by us as of the date of the Monsanto agreement or during the 30 months thereafter, in the field of agriculture. The Monsanto agreement also included the transfer of technology from us to Monsanto and initially included a collaborative research project. Under the Monsanto agreement, Monsanto will be our exclusive collaborator in the agriculture field for a ten-year period.  For more information regarding the Monsanto agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.    In May 2008, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to pursue the development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Under the Takeda agreement, we granted to Takeda a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our intellectual property, including delivery-related intellectual property, controlled by us as of the date of the Takeda agreement or during the five years thereafter, to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize RNAi therapeutics, subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties. The license initially is limited to the fields of oncology and metabolic disease and may be expanded at Takeda’s option to include other therapeutic areas, subject to specified conditions.  For more information regarding the Takeda agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Other Strategic License Agreements.
 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).    In January 2015, we and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, entered into a second amended and restated strategic collaboration and license agreement, which we further amended in July 2015. The 2015 Ionis agreement provides for certain new exclusive target cross-licenses of intellectual property on eight disease targets, providing each company with exclusive RNA therapeutic license rights for four programs, and extends the parties’ existing non-exclusive technology cross-license, which was originally entered into in 2004 and was amended and restated in 2009, through April 2019.  Under the original agreement, Ionis licensed to us its patent estate related to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi products.  In turn, we non-exclusively licensed to Ionis our patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, single stranded RNAi therapeutics and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. Ionis also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi drugs targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a non-exclusive basis. For more information regarding the 2015 Ionis agreement, including its ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note 3, Significant Agreements, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property Licenses
 In December 2002, we entered into a co-exclusive license with Max Planck Innovation GmbH (formerly known as Garching Innovation GmbH), or Max Planck Innovation, for the worldwide rights to use and sublicense certain patented technology to develop and commercialize therapeutic products and related applications. We also obtained the rights to use, without the right to sublicense, the technology for all diagnostic uses other than for the purposes of therapeutic monitoring. We were also given the right to acquire the remaining 50 percent exclusive rights, which right we exercised upon our acquisition of Ribopharma AG in July 2003. In June 
 14


2005, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Max Planck Innovation that secured our exclusivity to use and sublicense certain patented technology to develop and commercialize therapeutic products and related applications.
 We are not obligated to pay any development or sales milestone payments to Max Planck Innovation, however, we will be required to pay Max Planck Innovation future single-digit royalties on net sales of all therapeutic and prophylactic products developed with the technology, if any.
 Our agreements with Max Planck Innovation generally remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed thereunder. We estimate that the principal issued patents covered under the Max Planck Innovation agreements will expire both in and outside the United States during 2021, subject to any potential patent term extensions, restoration and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. We may terminate the agreements without cause with six months’ prior notice to Max Planck Innovation, and Max Planck Innovation may terminate the agreements in the event that we materially breach our obligations thereunder. Max Planck Innovation also has the right to terminate the agreements in the event that we, independently or through a third party, attack the validity of any of the licensed patents.
 Delivery-Related License Agreements
 Arbutus.    In November 2012, we, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, or ABC (formerly Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and Protiva Biotherapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC, and together with ABC, referred to as Arbutus, agreed to restructure our existing contractual relationship. In connection with this restructuring, the parties entered into a cross-license agreement that superseded the prior license and manufacturing agreements among us.
 Under the 2012 cross-license agreement, the parties consolidated certain intellectual property related to LNP technology for the systemic delivery of RNAi therapeutics. Specifically, certain patents and patent applications, including the MC3 lipid family used with patisiran, were assigned by us to ABC. We retain rights to use this intellectual property for the research, development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutic products, including the rights to sublicense this intellectual property on a product-by-product basis. Arbutus has also granted us a worldwide license to its LNP technology for the research, development and commercialization of LNP-based RNAi therapeutics, which license shall be exclusive for up to eight targets designated by us, and otherwise shall be non-exclusive. We have the right to sublicense on a product-by-product basis.
 In addition, we elected to buy out our manufacturing obligations to ABC with respect to our LNP-based pipeline programs. We made a one-time payment of $30.0 million to ABC for the termination of, and our release from, all of our obligations under the manufacturing agreement. We also have the right to manufacture and have manufactured our LNP-based RNAi therapeutics, which right may be sublicensed to our collaborators.
 Further, pursuant to the 2012 cross-license agreement, we made a one-time payment of $35.0 million to ABC, which amount included a license termination payment, as well as the buy-down of certain milestone payments and the significant reduction of royalty rates for certain LNP-based products, including patisiran. In addition, we agreed to pay ABC an aggregate of $10.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to advancement of ALN-VSP and patisiran, representing the only remaining milestone obligations for these products. In December 2013, we paid to ABC $5.0 million in connection with the initiation of our APOLLO Phase 3 clinical trial for patisiran, fulfilling one of these milestone obligations. With respect to the second $5.0 million milestone, in August 2013, we initiated binding arbitration proceedings to resolve a disagreement with ABC regarding the achievement by ABC of this milestone under our cross-license agreement relating to the manufacture of ALN-VSP clinical trial material for use in China. The Arbutus arbitration hearing was held in May 2015. In March 2016, the arbitration panel ruled in our favor and as a result, no milestone payment is due to Arbutus at this time. The grounds on which Arbutus could appeal this ruling were limited and Arbutus did not appeal by the June 8, 2016 deadline.
 Under the 2012 cross-license agreement, Arbutus has three exclusive and ten non-exclusive licenses to research, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics directed to up to thirteen gene targets.  Arbutus may sublicense these rights on a product-by-product basis. We are eligible to receive from Arbutus up to an aggregate of $8.5 million in milestone payments for RNAi therapeutics directed to nine of the targets for which we have granted licenses to Arbutus, together with single-digit royalties on annual product sales, if any, of RNAi therapeutic products directed to all thirteen of the targets for which we have granted licenses to Arbutus. Due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development, we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from Arbutus.
 The term of the 2012 cross-license agreement generally ends upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the first commercial sale of a product in a country and continuing during any period in which (a) in the case of us, a valid claim within the Arbutus Royalty-Bearing Patents (as defined in the 2012 cross-license agreement) covers our applicable product in such country of sale, or (b) in the case of Arbutus products, a valid 
 15


claim within our patents covers the applicable Arbutus product in such country of sale. We estimate that our fundamental RNAi patents covered under the 2012 cross-license agreement will expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2019 and 2021, and that the Arbutus LNP patents covered under the 2012 cross-license agreement will expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2020 and 2030, subject in each case to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. Either party may terminate a license it granted to the other in the event that the other party fails to cure a material breach of its obligations relating to that license. Furthermore, either party may terminate the 2012 cross-license agreement in the event the other party fails to cure a material breach of an obligation under the agreement. In addition, either party may terminate the 2012 cross-license agreement upon patent-related challenges by the other party.
 UBC and Acuitas.    In July 2009, we entered into a research agreement with The University of British Columbia, or UBC, and Acuitas Therapeutics Inc., or Acuitas (formerly AlCana Technologies, Inc.), that was focused on the discovery of novel lipids, such as the MC3 lipid, which is employed in patisiran. Pursuant to the terms of the research agreement, we funded collaborative research through July 2012, which was conducted by our scientists, together with scientists at UBC and Acuitas. Under the research agreement, UBC and Acuitas are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $1.3 million in milestone payments from us for each licensed product (as defined in the research agreement) directed to a particular target (as defined in the research agreement), together with single-digit royalty payments on annual product sales, if any.
 Concurrent with the execution of the research agreement, we also entered into a supplemental agreement with ABC, Protiva, UBC and Acuitas, which contains additional terms regarding the intellectual property rights arising out of the research agreement. In connection with 2012 cross-license agreement with Arbutus described above, we and Arbutus agreed to supersede the rights and obligations under the supplemental agreement as between ourselves, with the rights and obligations set forth in the 2012 cross-license agreement.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We have devoted considerable effort and resources to establish what we believe to be a strong intellectual property position relevant to RNAi therapeutic products and delivery technologies. In this regard, we have amassed a portfolio of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property covering:

• | fundamental aspects of the structure and uses of siRNAs, including their use as therapeutics, and RNAi-related mechanisms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | chemical modifications to siRNAs that improve their suitability for therapeutic and other uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | siRNAs directed to specific targets as treatments for particular diseases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delivery technologies, such as in the fields of carbohydrate conjugates and cationic liposomes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all aspects of our specific development candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such broad and exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Our intellectual property estate for RNAi therapeutics includes over 3,400 active cases and over 1,400 granted or issued patents, of which over 500 are issued or granted in the United States, the EU, including by the European Patent Office, or EPO, and Japan. Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area.
 Intellectual Property Related to Fundamental Aspects and Uses of siRNA and RNAi-related Mechanisms
 In this category, we include United States and certain foreign patents and patent applications that claim key aspects of siRNA architecture and RNAi-related mechanisms. Specifically included are patents and patent applications covering targeted cleavage of mRNA directed by RNA-like oligonucleotides and double-stranded RNAs of particular lengths and particular structural features, such as blunt and/or overhanging ends, as well as various types and patterns of chemical modifications. Our strategy has been to secure exclusive rights where possible and appropriate to key patents and patent applications that we believe cover fundamental aspects of RNAi.
 16


The following table lists patents and/or patent applications to which we have secured rights that we regard as being fundamental for the use of siRNAs as therapeutics.

 We believe that we have a strong portfolio of broad rights to fundamental RNAi patents and patent applications. Many of these rights are exclusive, which we believe prevents potential competitors from commercializing products in the field of RNAi without taking a license from us. In securing these rights, we have focused on obtaining the strongest rights for those intellectual property assets we believe will be most important in providing competitive advantage with respect to RNAi therapeutic products.
 We believe that the Crooke patent series, issued in several countries around the world, covers the use of modified oligonucleotides to achieve enzyme-mediated cleavage of a target mRNA. We have obtained rights to the Crooke patents for use with double-stranded RNA products, through a license agreement with Ionis. Under the terms of our agreement, Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for double-stranded RNA products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role. Our agreement with Ionis was amended and restated in January 2015 to, among other things, extend the license for an additional five years, through April 2019.
 Through our acquisition of Ribopharma AG, now known as Alnylam Europe, we own the entire Kreutzer-Limmer patent portfolio, which includes pending applications in the United States and many countries worldwide.
 The Glover patent series has resulted in several patent grants, including in Europe (EP 1230375). We have an exclusive license to the Glover patent for therapeutic uses from Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRT.
 The Tuschl patent applications owned by Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or Whitehead, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, UMass and Max Planck Gesellschaft zur Foerderung der Wissenschaften e.V. on the invention by Dr. Tuschl and his colleagues, which we call the Tuschl I patent series, cover compositions and methods important for RNAi discovery. We are the exclusive licensee of the Tuschl I patent series for RNAi therapeutics. The Tuschl patent applications owned by Max Planck Gesellschaft zur Foerderung der Wissenschaften e.V., Whitehead, MIT and UMass on the invention by Dr. Tuschl and his colleagues, which we call the Tuschl II patent series, cover what we believe are key structural features of siRNAs. Specifically, the Tuschl II patents and patent applications include claims directed to synthetic siRNAs and the use of chemical modifications to stabilize siRNAs. We have obtained an exclusive license to claims in the Tuschl II patent series uniquely covering the use of RNAi for therapeutic purposes. Collectively, the Tuschl I and II patent families cover a wide range of double-stranded RNA molecules including those unmodified and those comprising chemical modifications. Examples of those chemical modifications encompassed by the Tuschl claims include those modifications made in the ribose ring, e.g., at the 2’ position such as 2’-OMe, 2’-F or modifications such as those found in locked and unlocked (acyclic) nucleotides.
 The Fire and Mello patent owned by the Carnegie Institution covers the use of double-stranded RNAs to induce RNAi. The Carnegie Institution has made this patent broadly available for licensing and we, like many companies, have taken a non-exclusive license to the patent for therapeutic purposes. We believe, however, that the claims of the Fire and Mello patent do not cover the structural features of double-stranded RNAs that are important for the biological activity of siRNAs in mammalian cells. We believe that these specific features are the subjects of the Crooke, Kreutzer-Limmer, Glover and Tuschl II patents and patent applications for which we have secured exclusive rights.
 The other pending patent applications listed in the table above either provide further coverage for structural features of siRNAs or relate to the use of siRNAs in mammalian cells. For some of these, we have exclusive rights, and for others, we have non-exclusive rights. In addition, in December 2008, we acquired the intellectual property assets of Nucleonics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company. This acquisition included over 100 active patent filings, including 15 patents that have been granted worldwide, of which five have been granted in the United States and Europe. With this acquisition, we obtained patents and patent applications with early priority dates, notably the “Li & Kirby,” “Pachuk I” and “Giordano” patent families, that cover broad structural features of RNAi therapeutics, thus extending the breadth of our fundamental intellectual property.
 Intellectual Property Related to Chemical Modifications
 Our amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Ionis provided us with rights to practice the inventions covered by over 200 issued patents worldwide, as well as rights based on future chemistry patent applications through April 2014 for use with double-stranded RNA products. In January 2015, we entered into a second amended and restated agreement with Ionis to extend our rights to future chemistry applications through April 2019. These patents expire both in and outside the United States generally between 2015 and 2035, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. These inventions cover chemical modifications we may wish to incorporate into double-stranded RNA therapeutic products designed to work through an RNAi 
 20


mechanism. Under the terms of our agreement, Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for double-stranded RNA products designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role.
 In addition to licensing these intellectual property rights from Ionis, we are also working to develop our own proprietary chemical modifications that may be incorporated into siRNAs to endow them with drug-like properties. We have filed a large number of patent applications relating to these novel and proprietary chemical modifications.
 With the combination of the technology we have licensed from Ionis, various patents in the Tuschl II patent series and our own patent application filings, we possess issued claims that cover methods of making siRNAs that incorporate any of various chemical modifications, including the use of phosphorothioates, 2’-O-methyl and/or 2’-fluoro modifications and modifications such as those found in locked and unlocked (acyclic) nucleotides. These modifications are believed to be important for achieving “drug-like” properties for RNAi therapeutics. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to these claims for RNAi therapeutics.
 In addition to the above, in March 2014, we acquired the RNAi assets from Merck, which included intellectual property developed at Sirna and Merck. The acquired patent portfolio includes the “McSwiggen” patent families with issued and pending claims covering highly chemically modified oligonucleotide compositions, both single- and double-stranded and independent of 5’ and 3’ architecture. A total of thirteen patents have granted in the United States with claims directed to various combinations of chemical modifications to double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides. Notably, U.S. 8,273,866 was granted in September 2012 with significant patent term adjustment extending the expiration of this patent to mid-2028. EP423406 was granted in September 2010 with claims directed to double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides with ten or more chemical modifications on the pyrimidine residues of the sense and/or antisense strand. As indicated in the chart above, four additional EP patents have granted with claims to various combinations of chemically modified compositions comprising double-stranded RNA of between 18 and 24 nucleotides and methods of making and using such combinations. In November 2015, U.S. 9,181,551 granted with claims directed to highly modified double-stranded RNA molecules comprising a ligand, with dependent claims wherein the ligand is chosen from a ligand for a cellular receptor, a protein localization sequence, an antibody, a nucleic acid aptamer, a vitamin, a co-factor, a phospholipid, a cholesterol, a polyamine, a galactose, a galactosamine, a folate, an N-acetyl-galactosamine (wherein the N-acetylgalactosamine is a mono-antennary, bi-antennary or a tri-antennary galactosamine). Additional dependent claims are directed to highly modified double-stranded RNA with modified nucleotides, including but not limited to unlocked (acyclic) and locked nucleotides.
 Intellectual Property Related to the Delivery of siRNAs to Cells
 We also pursue internal research and collaborative approaches regarding the delivery of siRNAs to mammalian cells. These approaches include exploring technology that may allow delivery of siRNAs to cells through the use of cholesterol and carbohydrate conjugation, cationic lipids, peptide and antibody-based targeting, and polymer conjugations. Our collaborative efforts have included working with academic and corporate third parties to examine specific embodiments of these various approaches to delivery of siRNAs to appropriate cell tissue, and in-licensing and/or acquiring the most promising technology.
 In September 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, granted U.S. Patent No. 8,828,956 with claims directed to compositions including those comprising a modified RNA agent linked to a biantennary or triantennary ligand. Specifically, the granted patent includes claims that broadly cover single- or double-stranded, chemically modified RNA therapeutic molecules conjugated with a GalNAc ligand independent of length, sequence or disease target.
 The acquisition of Sirna also accelerated our overall efforts to develop and commercialize siRNA delivery technologies, including GalNAc-siRNA conjugate technology. As part of the Sirna acquisition, we obtained several patent families directed to various conjugate technologies including “tetra-GalNAc” compositions and methods. The tetra-GalNAc cases are pending worldwide and will expire May 1, 2033. Also included were patent families directed to novel lipid compositions and formulations that are pending worldwide and set to expire May 31, 2031.
 In addition to the Sirna delivery technology, we have a license from UBC and Arbutus in the field of RNAi therapeutics to intellectual property covering cationic liposomes and their use to deliver nucleic acid to cells. The issued United States patents and foreign counterparts, including the Semple (U.S. Patent No 6,858,225) and Wheeler (U.S. Patent No. 6,815,432) patents, cover compositions, methods of making and methods of using cationic liposomes to deliver agents, such as nucleic acid molecules, to cells. These patents expire both in and outside the United States on October 30, 2017 and June 7, 2015, respectively, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available.
 21


In addition, in April 2012, the USPTO granted U.S. Patent No. 8,158,601, covering composition of matter and formulations of the MC3 lipid, as well as methods of using these compositions and formulations. MC3 is being utilized in our patisiran development program. We assigned this patent, amongst other patents and patent applications relating to lipids and LNP technology, to Arbutus in connection with our November 2012 restructuring and cross-license agreement. We retain rights to use this intellectual property for the research, development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutic products, including the rights to sublicense this intellectual property on a product-by-product basis. A description of our 2012 restructuring and cross-license agreement with Arbutus is set forth above under “Strategic Alliances — Other Strategic License Agreements — Delivery-Related License Agreements — Arbutus.”
 Intellectual Property Related to siRNAs Directed to Specific Targets
 We have filed a number of patent applications claiming specific siRNAs directed to various gene targets that correlate to specific diseases. While there may be a significant number of competing applications filed by other organizations claiming siRNAs to treat the same gene target, we were among the first companies to focus and file on RNAi therapeutics, and thus, we believe that a number of our patent applications may predate competing applications that others may have filed. Reflecting this, in August 2005, the EPO granted a broad patent, which we call the Kreutzer-Limmer II patent, with 103 allowed claims on therapeutic compositions, methods and uses comprising siRNAs that are complementary to mRNA sequences in over 125 disease target genes. In July 2009, the EPO ruled in our favor in an opposition proceeding related to the Kreutzer-Limmer II patent. The decision had been appealed by Sirna and was subsequently withdrawn upon our acquisition of Sirna. No further appeal before the EPO is available. The Kreutzer-Limmer II patent will expire on January 9, 2022, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates extending such term extensions in countries where such extensions may become available. Some of these claimed gene targets are being pursued by our development and pre-clinical programs, such as those expressed by viral pathogens including RSV and influenza virus. In addition, the claimed targets include oncogenes, cytokines, cell adhesion receptors, angiogenesis targets, apoptosis and cell cycle targets, and additional viral disease targets, such as hepatitis C virus and HIV. The Kreutzer-Limmer II patent series is pending in the United States and many foreign countries. Granted U.S. patent 8,618,277 obtained in the Sirna acquisition and set to expire February 20, 2023, contains claims directed to a highly chemically modified double-stranded siRNA of between 18-24 nucleotides specifically targeting the hepatitis B virus in a sequence independent manner. Moreover, a patent in the Tuschl II patent series, U.S. Patent No. 7,078,196, claims methods of preparing siRNAs that mediate cleavage of an mRNA in mammalian cells and, therefore, covers methods of making siRNAs directed toward any and all target genes. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to these claims for RNAi therapeutics.
 In 2016, we were granted U.S. Patent Nos. 9,370,581, 9,370,582 and 9,352,048 containing claims that broadly cover single- or double-stranded RNA therapeutic molecules conjugated with any bi or triantennary ligand (including but not limited to GalNAc) independent of length, specifically inhibiting TTR, PCSK9 or HBV, respectively, wherein the HBV-specific RNA molecule is fully chemically modified.
 Intellectual Property Related to Our Development Candidates
 As our development pipeline matures, we have made and plan to continue to make patent filings that claim all aspects of our development candidates, including dose, method of administration and manufacture.
Intellectual Property Challenges
 As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent applications are being fully processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review and opposition proceedings, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. On September 16, 2012, the America Invents Act went into effect and provided for expanded patent challenge, i.e., inter partes review and post-grant review. These provide additional opportunities for third parties to challenge our patents. For example, as noted in the table above, various third parties have initiated oppositions to patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl II series in the EPO, as well as in other jurisdictions. We expect that additional oppositions will be filed in the EPO and elsewhere, and other challenges will be raised relating to other patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area. A description of ongoing legal matters relating to certain aspects of our intellectual property portfolio is set forth in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Competition
 The pharmaceutical marketplace is extremely competitive, with hundreds of companies competing to discover, develop and market new drugs. We face a broad spectrum of current and potential competitors, ranging from very large, global pharmaceutical companies with significant resources, to other biotechnology companies with resources and expertise comparable to our own, to smaller biotechnology companies with fewer resources and expertise than we have. We believe that for most or all of our drug development programs, there will be one or more competing programs under development at other companies. In many cases, the companies with competing programs will have access to greater resources and expertise than we do and may be more advanced in those programs.
Competition for Our Business in General
 The competition we face can be grouped into three broad categories:
  
• | other companies working to develop RNAi and microRNA therapeutic products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies developing technology known as antisense, which, like RNAi, attempts to silence the activity of specific genes by targeting the mRNAs copied from them; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | marketed products and development programs for therapeutics that treat the same diseases for which we may also be developing treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. Some of these companies are seeking, as we are, to develop chemically synthesized siRNAs as drugs. Others are following a gene therapy approach, with the goal of treating patients not with synthetic siRNAs but with synthetic, exogenously-introduced genes designed to produce siRNA-like molecules within cells.
 Companies working on chemically synthesized siRNAs include Takeda, Marina Biotech, Inc., Arrowhead Research Corporation, or Arrowhead, and its subsidiary, Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Calando, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Quark, Silence Therapeutics plc, Arbutus, Sylentis, S.A.U., or Sylentis, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Dicerna, WAVE Life Sciences Ltd., or WAVE, and Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. Many of these companies have licensed our intellectual property. Benitec Biopharma Ltd., or Benitec, is working on gene therapy approaches to RNAi therapeutics. Companies working on microRNA therapeutics include Regulus Therapeutics, Inc., or Regulus, Rosetta Genomics Ltd., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, through its acquisition in 2014 of Santaris Pharma A/S, miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. and Asuragen, Inc.
 Antisense technology uses short, single-stranded, DNA-like molecules to block mRNAs encoding specific proteins. While we believe that RNAi drugs may potentially have significant advantages over antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, including greater potency and specificity, others are developing ASO drugs that are currently at a more advanced stage of development than RNAi drugs. For example, Ionis has developed several ASO drugs that have received regulatory approval. Ionis is also developing antisense drugs using ligand-conjugated GalNAc technology licensed from us, and these drugs have been shown to have increased potency at lower doses in clinical and pre-clinical studies, compared with antisense drugs that do not use such licensed GalNAc technology.  In addition, a number of other companies have ASO-based product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, including Roche, Celgene Corporation, Antisense Therapeutics, Ltd., WAVE and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. 
 The competitive landscape continues to expand and we expect that additional companies will initiate programs focused on the development of RNAi therapeutic products using the approaches described above as well as potentially new approaches that may result in the more rapid development of RNAi therapeutics or more effective technologies for RNAi drug development or delivery.
 Competing Drugs for Our Investigational RNAi Therapeutics in Advanced Clinical Development
 Hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis.    Until recently, organ transplantation was the only treatment option for patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Only a subset of patients with early stage disease qualify for this costly and invasive procedure, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. Even following liver transplantation, the disease continues to progress for many patients, presumably due to ongoing deposition of wild-type TTR protein. The only approved drug for ATTR amyloidosis is tafamidis, marketed by Pfizer Inc., for the treatment of early stage disease.  Tafamidis is approved in Europe, certain countries in Latin America and Japan (where it is approved for all stages of disease). The only currently available treatments for cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis are aimed at relief of symptoms, such as diuretics, or water pills, to treat the swelling of the ankles, one of the symptoms of the disease. For patients with advanced cardiomyopathy, heart transplant is a therapeutic option. Again, the scarcity of organs for transplantation, and the mortality, morbidity and cost associated with this procedure render it a realistic option for only a very small number of patients. Pfizer is currently evaluating tafamidis in a Phase 3 trial in patients with cardiomyopathy.  
 23


Several other drugs are in clinical development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Ionis, together with its partner GlaxoSmithKline plc, is developing IONIS-TTRRx, an ASO designed to treat hATTR amyloidosis. IONIS-TTRRx is administered as a subcutaneous injection, once-weekly. Ionis has reported that it has completed enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial of IONIS-TTRRx in ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and is expected to complete the study in 2017, likely in advance of the completion of our APOLLO Phase 3 study. In addition, diflunisal, a commercially available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has been found to stabilize TTR in vitro. A National Institute of Health-sponsored clinical trial concluded that the use of diflunisal compared with placebo for two years reduced the rate of progression of neurological impairment and preserved quality of life. As published, the discontinuation rate was high in this clinical trial in both treatment arms (approximately 50 percent overall) and the majority of patients continued to deteriorate, including patients on diflunisal. Furthermore, the safety profile of this drug and its known adverse effects, particularly on the kidney and heart, could likely limit the potential use of it in this disease.
 Finally, several other companies have early stage programs evaluating monoclonal antibodies and small molecules for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. These companies are likely several years away from filing for marketing authorization for their investigational therapies. 
 Hemophilia.   The global market for treatments of hemophilia and bleeding disorders is valued at more than $10.0 billion. Products on the market include: Factor VIII replacement products marketed by Shire plc (formerly marketed by Baxalta Incorporated), Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, CSL Behring, Biogen Inc. and others; Factor IX replacement products marketed by Pfizer, Shire, Biogen, CSL Behring and others. Several factor replacement products with extended half-lives (Eloctate/Elocta, Alprolix, Idelvion) have been recently approved and several more are in development. For the treatment of persons with inhibitors, a Factor VIIa replacement product marketed by Novo Nordisk and an activated prothrombin complex concentrate marketed by Shire are available.
 New, innovative molecules are currently in development, which may offer new treatments for people with HA and HB, with and without inhibitors. Roche/Genentech, Inc. is developing a bi-specific antibody (emicizumab or ACE910) which binds to factors IXa and X and mimics the Factor VIII cofactor function in people with HA. This product has been shown to reduce the incidence of bleeding events in people with HA with and without inhibitors in a completed Phase 1 trial and a recently completed Phase 3 trial in people with HA with inhibitors. A Phase 3 study of emicizumab in people with HA without inhibitors has also been initiated. Several companies are developing monoclonal antibodies against tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or TFPI, for the treatment of HA and HB. Novo Nordisk (concizumab) and Bayer (BAY 1093884) have programs, which are currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, and Shire has a program in pre-clinical development.
 A number of companies are actively developing gene therapy products that use a virus to deliver a functional segment of a particular gene into the cells of the person with hemophilia. Companies with development programs in gene therapy include Spark Therapeutics Inc. (SPK-9001 – Phase 1/2, HB), uniQure N.V., or uniQure, (AMT-060 – Phase 1/2, HB), Dimension Therapeutics, Inc. (DTX-101 – Phase 1/2, HB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMN 270 – Phase 1/2, HA). Recent data suggests that these agents may be effective in restoring and maintaining adequate factor levels to prevent bleeding in some patients.
 Hypercholesterolemia. The current standard of care for patients with hypercholesterolemia includes the use of dietary changes, lifestyle modification and the use of pharmacologic therapy. Front line therapy consists of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, which block production of cholesterol by the liver and increase clearance of LDL-C from the bloodstream. These include atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin and pravastatin. A different class of compounds, which includes ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin, function by blocking cholesterol uptake from the diet and are utilized on their own or in combination with statins. Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is marketing lomitapide, an microsomal triglyceride protein, or MTP, inhibitor for the treatment of dyslipidemia, in the United States and the EU for use in patients with HoFH.  In addition, mipomersen, a lipid-lowering weekly-injectable drug targeting apolipoprotein B-100, developed by Ionis, is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with HoFH. 
 In 2015, two anti-PCSK9 antibodies were approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States and Europe, alirocumab, developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in collaboration with Sanofi, and evolocumab, developed by Amgen Inc. In 2017, the U.S. District Court in Delaware granted an injunction against Sanofi and Regeneron requiring the withdrawal of alirocumab from the market in the United States as a result of a patent infringement lawsuit brought by Amgen.
 Other PCSK9-targeted approaches are in development at a number of companies, including Dicerna and Ionis. 
 Acute Hepatic Porphyrias.    The only approved treatments for acute attacks are preparations of heme derived from human blood. The global market for AHP is made up of intravenous hemin in the United States and intravenous heme arginate in the EU. Both products are currently manufactured by Recordati S.p.A. Despite the lack of randomized studies demonstrating clinical 
 24


efficacy, heme has been shown in case studies to hasten recovery from attacks and has been marketed since 1999 in the EU for the treatment of acute attacks of AIP,  hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria.
 In addition to heme, the AIPGENE consortium, a European collaboration that included industry sponsors UniQure and Digna Biotech, was developing AMT-021, a gene therapy product for the treatment of AIP, but this development program is currently on hold.  We are aware of other companies that have pre-clinical development programs for the treatment of AHPs.     
 Other Competition
 Finally, for many of the diseases that are the subject of our early stage clinical, pre-clinical development and discovery RNAi therapeutic programs, there are already drugs on the market or in development. For example, the global market for drugs that specifically target complement-mediated diseases is significant. The only product in this market is eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that inhibits the cleavage of the protein complement component 5 (C5) into its components C5a and C5b. Eculizumab has been approved by the FDA and the EC to treat PNH, as well as aHUS, a systemic disease cause by chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement system. Eculizumab is also currently being studied in a number of other diseases that are believed to be complement-mediated including: neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis, antibody-mediated rejection and delayed graft function.  A number of other products are also in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. In addition, with respect to ALN-HBV, oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues have demonstrated the ability to potently inhibit HBV replication and suppress levels of HBV DNA in patients with HBV and are approved for the treatment of these patients in the United States, Europe and other countries. In addition, a large number of novel agents, including agents using chemically synthesized siRNA, are currently in development for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe there currently exists sufficient unmet medical need to warrant the advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Regulatory Matters
 U.S. Regulatory Considerations
 The research, testing, manufacture and marketing of drug products and their delivery systems are extensively regulated in the United States and the rest of the world. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, packaging, labeling, promotion and advertising, marketing and distribution of drug products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed sanctions and the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals to test or market drug products. These sanctions could include, among other things, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, clinical holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 The steps ordinarily required before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States include nonclinical laboratory tests, animal tests and formulation studies, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical testing, approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug product is safe and effective for the indication for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA, review and recommendation by an advisory committee of independent experts (particularly for new chemical entities), satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the major investigational sites to ensure data integrity and assess compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and FDA review and approval of the NDA. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes several years, but may vary substantially depending upon the complexity of the product and the nature of the disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on a company’s activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities, including but not limited to the data derived from our clinical trials for patisiran, fitusiran, givosiran and inclisiran, is not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including new safety risks, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Clinical Trials.
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal testing to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of compounds for testing must 
 25


comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information, analytical and stability data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information.
 A 30-day waiting period after the filing of an IND is required prior to such application becoming effective and the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not commented on, or questioned, the application during this 30-day waiting period, clinical trials may begin. If the FDA has comments or questions, these must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA prior to commencement of clinical trials. The IND review process can result in substantial delay and expense. We, an IRB, or the FDA may, at any time, suspend, terminate or impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. For example, in October 2016, we discontinued development of revusiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was in development for the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy due to hATTR amyloidosis, due to safety concerns. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and requirements, including GCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards and FDA requirements for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure data integrity and protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants and include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on human subjects in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to primarily assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and metabolism associated with increasing doses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to assess the optimum dosage and dose regimen, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the drug in the indication being studied.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a drug may be effective and the risks are considered acceptable given the observed efficacy of the drug and the severity of the illness, Phase 3 clinical trials may be undertaken to further evaluate the drug’s clinical efficacy, side effects, and safety in an expanded patient population, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any drug candidates may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States. The FDA may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the subject. An IRB or a clinical trial sponsor also may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about certain ongoing and completed clinical trials on a government website administered by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and are subject to civil monetary penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for failing to meet these obligations. After successful completion of the required clinical testing, as well as nonclinical testing and manufacturing requirements, generally an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
 New Drug Applications.
 We believe that any RNAi product candidate we develop, whether for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, hemophilia and RBD, AHPs, hypercholesterolemia or the various indications targeted in our development or nonclinical discovery programs, will be regulated as a new drug by the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of a new drug may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of extensive nonclinical, clinical and other testing, as described above, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, proposed labeling and other information. In addition, an NDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data assessing the safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and support dosing and 
 26


administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is shown to be safe and effective. In some circumstances, the FDA may grant deferrals for the submission of some or all pediatric data, or full or partial waivers.
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject to substantial application user fees and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2017, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is approximately $2.0 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for drugs, and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals regarding the timing of its review of NDAs, although the FDA does not always meet these goals. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes independent clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA normally conducts a pre-approval inspection to gain assurance that the manufacturing facility, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability, and are in compliance with regulations governing cGMPs. In addition, the FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of select clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies to assure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP requirements.
 If the FDA evaluation of the NDA and the inspections of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or effectiveness and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug. In addition, the FDA may impose distribution and use restrictions and other limitations on labeling and communication activities with respect to an approved drug product through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan. Once granted, product approvals may be further limited or withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for AE reporting, submission of periodic reports, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution. Additionally, the FDA also strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, the FDA generally prohibits pharmaceutical companies from promoting their drugs or biologics for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation of any safety or effectiveness claims, including claims that one product is superior in terms of safety or effectiveness to another. Superiority claims generally must be supported by two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials. To the extent that market acceptance of our products may depend on their superiority over existing therapies, any restriction on our ability to advertise or otherwise promote claims of superiority, or requirements to conduct additional expensive clinical trials to provide proof of such claims, could negatively affect the sales of our products or our costs. We must also notify the FDA of any change in an approved product beyond variations already allowed in the approval. Certain changes to the product, its labeling or its manufacturing require prior FDA approval and may require the conduct of further clinical investigations to support the change, which may require the payment of additional, substantial user fees. Such approvals may be expensive and time-consuming and, if not approved, the FDA will not allow the product to be marketed as modified.
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA or issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter describes the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in an application and, when possible, recommends actions that the applicant might take to place the application in condition for approval. Such actions may include, among other things, conducting additional safety or efficacy studies after which the sponsor may resubmit the application for further review. Even with the completion of this additional testing or the submission of additional requested information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of an NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor.

Some of our product candidates may need to be administered using specialized drug delivery systems/devices. We may rely on drug delivery systems that are already approved to deliver drugs like ours to similar physiological sites or, in some instances, we may need to modify the design or labeling of the legally available device for delivery of our product candidate. The FDA may regulate the product as a combination product or require additional approvals or clearances for the modified device. In addition, to the extent the delivery device is owned by another company, we would need that company’s cooperation to implement the necessary changes to the device and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances. Obtaining such additional approvals or clearances, and cooperation of other companies, when necessary, could significantly delay, and increase the cost of obtaining marketing approval, which could reduce the commercial viability of a product candidate. To the extent that we rely on previously unapproved drug delivery systems, we may be subject to additional testing and approval requirements from the FDA above and beyond those described above.
 Abbreviated Applications.
 Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application upon expiration of certain patent and non-patent exclusivity periods, if any. An approved ANDA generally provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown through appropriate testing (unless waived) to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. There is no requirement, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing (which may be waived by the FDA), for an ANDA applicant to conduct or submit results of nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of its drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, are listed as such by the FDA and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) application is a type of NDA that relies, in part, upon data the applicant does not own and to which it does not have a right of reference. Such applications typically are submitted for changes to previously approved drug products.
 Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains a previously approved active ingredient but is approved in, among other things, a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, if the FDA determines that new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Federal law also provides a period of up to five years exclusivity following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, during which ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing the protected listed drug cannot be submitted unless the submission accompanies a challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Additionally, in the event that the sponsor of the listed drug has properly informed the FDA of patents covering its listed drug, applicants submitting an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing the listed drug are required to make one of four patent certifications for each listed patent, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is not seeking approval. If an applicant certifies its belief that one or more listed patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed (and thereby indicates it is seeking approval prior to patent expiration), it is required to provide notice of its filing to the NDA sponsor and the patent holder within certain time limits. If the patent holder then initiates a suit for patent infringement against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant within 45 days of receipt of the notice, the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until either 30 months have passed or there has been a court decision or settlement order holding or stating that the patents in question are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. If the patent holder does not initiate a suit for patent infringement within the 45 days, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be approved immediately upon successful completion of FDA review, unless blocked by another listed patent or regulatory exclusivity period. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that it does not intend to market its generic product before some or all listed patents on the listed drug expire, then the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until those patents expire. The first of the ANDA applicants submitting substantially complete applications certifying that one or more listed patents for a particular product are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed may qualify for an exclusivity period of 180 days running from when the generic product is first marketed, during which subsequently submitted ANDAs containing similar certifications cannot be granted effective approval. The 180-day generic exclusivity can be forfeited in various ways, including if the first applicant does not market its product within specified statutory timelines. If more than one applicant files a substantially complete ANDA on the same day, each such first applicant will be entitled to share the 180-day exclusivity period, but there will only be one such period, beginning on the date of first marketing by any of the first applicants.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, also collectively referred to as the PPACA or the Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the 
 28


Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the Public Health Service Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated licensure pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated licensure pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after licensure if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been granted licensure if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Orphan Drug Designation (ODD).
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant ODD to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. We intend to request ODD designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA has granted ODD for patisiran as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, fitusiran as a therapeutic approach for hemophilia and givosiran as a therapeutic approach for AHPs.
 If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same structural features, and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. Notwithstanding the above definitions, a drug that is clinically superior to an orphan drug will not be considered the “same drug” and thus will not be blocked by orphan drug exclusivity.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Pediatric Study Plans.
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 29


Fast Track Program.
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or –biologics license application, or BLA, meeting. Notable to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. We intend to request Fast Track designation for our product candidates, if applicable. For example, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to patisiran for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and the FDA’s goal for taking action on an application with a Priority Review designation is six months instead of ten months. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefits. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation.
 FDASIA also amended the FDCA to require FDA to expedite the development and review of a “breakthrough therapy.” A drug or biological product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug or biological product be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather nonclinical, manufacturing/controls and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, and allowing a rolling review. We intend to request “breakthrough therapy” designation for our product candidates, if applicable.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement.
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the 
 30


medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Even if a drug product is covered, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Federal, state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drug products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
  
• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1 percent of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1 percent of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In order for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a 50 percent discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective in 2011, the PPACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31


 
• | Effective in 2012, the PPACA required certain manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers annually report this information to CMS, which posts this information on its website.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain drug products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Change in Laws or Policies.
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be. Federal budget uncertainties or spending reductions may reduce the capabilities of the FDA, extend the duration of required regulatory reviews, and reduce the availability of clinical research grants.
EU Regulatory Considerations
 In the EU medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels.
 Clinical Trials.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an entity within the EU to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in October 2018, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.
 The sponsor of a clinical trial must register the clinical trial in advance, and information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial will be made public as part of the registration. The results of the clinical trial must be submitted to the competent authorities and, with the exception of non-pediatric Phase 1 trials, will be made public at the latest within 12 months after the end of the trial.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national medicines regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for 
 32


example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorizations.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, we must obtain a marketing authorization before we may place a medicinal product on the market in the EU. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of product involved. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, or CTD, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical study and clinical trial information. There is an increasing trend in the EU towards greater transparency and, while the manufacturing or quality information is currently generally protected as confidential information, the EMA and national regulatory authorities are now liable to disclose much of the nonclinical and clinical information in marketing authorization dossiers, including the full clinical study reports, in response to freedom of information requests after the marketing authorization has been granted. In October 2014, the EMA adopted a policy under which clinical study reports would be posted on the agency’s website following the grant, denial or withdrawal of a marketing authorization application, subject to procedures for limited redactions and protection against unfair commercial use. A similar requirement is contained in the new Regulation on Clinical Trials that is currently expected to take effect in October 2018.
 The centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU and, by extension (after national implementing decisions), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which, together with the EU member states, comprise the European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file MAAs with the EMA, where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, or EC, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005) indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products, such as gene or cell therapy medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005), (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or (iii) if its authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health.
 For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit MAAs to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state; (2) the decentralized procedure, in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state, and in which the EU member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EU member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. A national procedure is only possible for one member state; as soon as an application is submitted in a second member state the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure will be triggered.
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 Data Exclusivity.
 MAAs for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic MAAs referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
 33


There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate pre-clinical studies or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Orphan Medicinal Products.
 The EMA’s COMP may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the EC adopts a decision granting orphan status. The COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of an MAA and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product, unless it offers a significant clinical benefit. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Post-Approval Controls.
 The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, or QPPV, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
 All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 Manufacturing.
 Medicinal products may only be manufactured in the EU, or imported into the EU from another country, by the holder of a manufacturing authorization from the competent national authority. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person, or QP, who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with EU standards of cGMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with cGMP.
Pricing and Reimbursement.
 Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the EU through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own 
 34


prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
 Foreign Regulation of New Drug Compounds
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the EU, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in all or most foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Similarly, all clinical trials in Australia require, among other things, review and approval of clinical trial proposals by an ethics committee, which provides a combined ethical and scientific review process.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, which have their origin in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, the applicable regulatory requirements, and guidelines developed by the ICH for GCP in clinical trials.
 The approval procedure also varies among countries and can involve requirements for additional testing. The time required may differ from that required for FDA approval and may be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Hazardous Materials
 Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Manufacturing
 To date, we have manufactured only limited supplies of drug substance for use in IND-enabling toxicology studies in animals at our own facility, as well as patisiran formulated bulk drug product for use in clinical trials.  We have contracted with several third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of drug substance and finished product, other than patisiran, to meet our testing needs for pre-clinical toxicology and clinical testing. We expect to continue to rely on third-party CMOs for the supply of drug substance and certain drug product, including siRNAs and siRNA conjugates, for our product candidates for at least the next several years, including to support the launch of our first several products. During 2015, we amended our manufacturing agreement with Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to provide for Agilent to supply, subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, a specified percentage of the active pharmaceutical ingredients required for certain of our products in clinical development, as well as other products the parties may agree upon in the future, over an initial term of four years. We are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order. Agilent is required to reserve sufficient capacity to ensure that it can supply products in the amounts specified under such firm orders, as well as up to a certain percentage of the remaining, non-binding portions of each forecast. Subject to any conflicting obligations under our third-party agreements, we have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into a separate commercial manufacturing supply agreement with Agilent for certain products, consistent with certain specified terms, including a specified minimum purchase commitment. In April 2016, we completed our purchase of a parcel of land in Norton, Massachusetts. We have commenced construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility at this site for drug substance, including siRNAs and siRNA conjugates, for clinical and commercial use, which we currently expect to be commercially operational in 2020.
 During 2012, we established a manufacturing facility and have developed cGMP capabilities and processes for the manufacture of patisiran formulated bulk drug product for late stage clinical trials and commercial use. During 2013, we manufactured our first cGMP batches of patisiran for use in our Phase 2 OLE and Phase 3 clinical trials. We expect to manufacture late stage clinical and commercial supply for patisiran formulated bulk drug product in our facility. Commercial quantities of any 
 35


drugs that we may seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with FDA regulations and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as comparable foreign regulations.
 We believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party CMOs and our current internal cGMP manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and early stage commercial needs. We believe that the supply capacity we have established externally, together with the internal capacity we developed to support pre-clinical trials, our existing facility for patisiran formulated bulk drug product and the new facility we are building, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the next several years. We monitor the capacity availability for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our CMOs and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs. We also believe that our products can be manufactured at a scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs.
 Commercial Operations
 After years of work, successfully discovering a new product platform technology, developing a potential new class of innovative medicines and retaining broad commercial rights, our next objective is to introduce our RNAi therapeutics to as many patients in need as possible. To meet that new challenge, we intend to build a global commercial operation which will be fully integrated and ready to sequentially manage the potential of multiple product launches across multiple geographies. As a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, we intend to have the ability to market and sell our products ourselves in many countries. The conduct of these commercial activities will be dependent upon if, and when, regulatory approval is obtained for our product candidates and on agreements that we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators, currently as follows: 

• | For patisiran, if APOLLO is positive, we have rights to commercialize in the United States, Canada and Western Europe while Sanofi Genzyme has rights to commercialize in the rest of the world;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For fitusiran, if ATLAS is positive, we have rights to co-commercialize with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, and Sanofi Genzyme has rights to commercialize in the rest of the world;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For givosiran, we retain global rights to commercialize; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | For inclisiran, we have granted MDCO global rights to commercialize.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Throughout the development of our product candidates, we have remained focused on keeping patients at the center of everything we do. This patient focus will continue as we move towards commercialization. Moreover, our late stage programs are focused on orphan diseases, and these patients and their families are often in need of more than just a product.  It is our goal to identify information, education solutions and services that benefit these patients and their families, and to have a rich patient services approach in these orphan diseases. In addition, we are focused early in the product development cycle on establishing evidence that we can bring to payors about the pharmacoeconomic opportunities that our product candidates represent to ensure access for patients.
 During 2016, we started to assemble key components of a commercial organization with a focus on preparation for the potential commercial launch of patisiran in 2018, if APOLLO is positive and regulatory approval is obtained.  We are beginning to assemble a focused commercial team with broad experience in marketing, sales, patient access, distribution and product reimbursement, in particular for orphan diseases.  As we continue to prepare for a potential patisiran commercial launch in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, we plan to expand our commercial organization over the next twelve to eighteen months. This expansion will include incorporation of appropriate quality systems, compliance policies and procedures, implementation of internal systems and infrastructure in order to support commercial sales, and establishment of patient-focused programs. We have also begun to establish a presence in major European markets with the hiring of country general managers, market access professionals and medical experts. In each country where our product candidates are approved by health authorities (if, when and where), we plan to build a full commercial team composed of marketing, field sales and patient services on time to execute successful launches. For some territories/countries, we may also elect in to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products.
