Organizational History
 
Regnum Corp. was organized on March 31, 2016 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We were formed for the primary business purpose of servicing the increasing demand for premium entertainment content and becoming a depository of unpublished intellectual properties for resale with a focus on achieving profitability and sustaining business growth. Our business model was, until April 2020, based on acquiring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from studios, agencies and production companies, for subsequent recycling or production in a wide variety of media, with the intent to resell such works back to the entertainment community for a profit. See “Recent Transactions and Changes of Control” below.
Recent Transactions and Changes of Control
 
On February 5, 2020, Ocean Ave Holdings, LLC (“Ocean”) which is owned and controlled by Ms. Tiffani Jones, the former sole director and officer of the Company, sold 20,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company in consideration for $345,000, to Tri Capital Energy Corporation (“Tri Capital”), pursuant to an Agreement for the Purchase of Common Stock. The shares which were sold represented 87% of the Company’s then outstanding shares, which resulted in a change of control of the Company. Tri Capital is controlled by Mr. Gary Allen and Mr. Mark Gustavson. 
 
On February 26, 2020, Tri Capital sold all 20,000,000 shares of the restricted common stock of Regnum Corp. (acquired on 02/05/2020) for the Purchase of Common Stock to Wookey Search Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Wookey”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Consideration for the acquisition of the shares was $50,000 in cash and a Promissory Note (secured by the 20 million shares of Regnum purchased pursuant to the agreement) in the amount of $400,000, which note has been repaid.  Wookey is a company controlled by Mr. Mark Gustavson, a former CEO and Director of Regnum Corp.  
 
On April 7, 2021, Wookey, the previous majority shareholder of the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement for the sale of 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, to Phoenixus AG, an accredited investor. Phoenixus AG also acquired an additional 2,680,000 shares of common stock from three minority shareholders.  In connection with the sale of such shares, an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock held by Gary Allen were returned to the Company for cancellation. As a result of the acquisition of 22,680,000 shares of common stock, and the cancellation of 1,000,000 shares, Phoenixus AG holds approximately 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, and as such it is able to unilaterally control the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of the Company.

Also, on April 7, 2021, Mark Gustavson, former Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Director of the Company, and Ross Meador, former Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, resigned their positions with the Company. Upon such resignations, Anne Kirby was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, President and sole Director. Rob Stubblefield remains the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
 
On May 13, 2021, Regnum entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SevenScore Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SevenScore”).
 
The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (a) SevenScore will be merged with and into Regnum (the “Merger”), with Regnum being the surviving corporation in the Merger, and (b) at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), membership interests in SevenScore will be converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 25,878,168 shares of common stock of Regnum (the “Merger Consideration”).  Each SevenScore membership interest shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be automatically converted into and exchangeable for a fraction of a fully paid and nonassessable share of Regnum Common Stock equal to one multiplied by a fraction obtained by dividing (A) 25,878,168 by (B) 26,128,168 (the “Exchange”). There are currently 22,950,000 shares of common stock of Regnum issued and outstanding, of which 22,700,000 shares are owned by Phoenixus AG, a company organized under the laws of Switzerland (“PAG”).  Upon effectiveness of the Merger, (i) each share of Regnum Common Stock issued and outstanding and owned by PAG as of immediately prior thereto shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and (ii) 22,730,409 shares of Regnum Common Stock will be owned by PAG as a result of conversion of SevenScore membership interests; (ii) 3,147,759 shares of Regnum Common Stock being owned by several other SevenScore members; and (iii) 250,000 shares of Regnum Common Stock being owned by the Regnum shareholders, other than PAG, prior to effectiveness of the Merger.  As a result of the current ownership of control shares of Regnum by PAG, as well as the membership interest in SevenScore owned by PAG, the Merger will not affect a change of control of Regnum.
 
Notice of the merger, as well as the Company’s intention to change the name of the Company to SevenScore Pharmaceuticals Inc., was provide to FINRA on June 10, 2021.  
 
Description of Business Operations:
 
Our prior business model was based on procuring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from independent writers, filmmakers, studios, agencies and production companies for subsequent reworking and/or production in a wide variety of media with intent to resell back to the entertainment community for profit.
 
As discussed herein, in April 2021, the prior business model was abandoned and the Company entered into that certain Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement”) with SevenScore, pursuant to which officers of the Company undertook management responsibilities for the operations of SevenScore. The Management Agreement was entered into in contemplation of a proposed business combination between the Company and SevenScore set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
 
SevenScore is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics that treat rare and infectious diseases, specifically in populations that are neglected or face adherence challenges.  SevenScore’s primary asset is commercial rights of leronlimab (PRO 140) in all HIV indications within the United States.  Leronlimab (PRO 140) is a CCR5 antagonist expected to receive an indication to treat Multi-Drug Resistant HIV infection, with the potential for multiple additional therapeutic indications in HIV.  The names leronlimab and PRO 140 will be used interchangeably throughout this report.

Business Process
 
Our prior business process entailed seeking out and acquiring low budget unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from independent writers, filmmakers, studios, agencies and production companies, reworking them into new commercially viable projects, and lastly, marketing and selling them back to the entertainment industry for a profit.  During 2020, we acquired options for six scripts from two writers [production companies] in Southern California for $1,000 each and subsequently sold four of them before the end of 2020 for $2,250 each. 
 
We are currently operating under the Management Agreement, pursuant to which our CEO is assisting SevenScore as it is preparing for the commercialization of leronlimab for Multi-Drug Resistant HIV.  Ongoing efforts include, the development of marketing strategies and market access plans, establishing strategic partnerships with specialty pharmacies and patient services companies, and headcount planning. The Company is also looking to in-license developmental and commercial stage products.
 
The preclinical and clinical development of PRO 140 was led by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Progenics”) through 2011. CytoDyn, Inc (“CytoDyn”) acquired the asset from Progenics in October 2012.  In February 2018, CytoDyn announced they had met the primary endpoint in its Phase 3 trial for leronlimab as a combination therapy with HAART for highly treatment experienced HIV patients and filed the non-clinical portion of the Biologics License Application (“BLA) on March 18, 2019. Vyera Pharmaceuticals (“Vyera”) acquired the marketing rights from CytoDyn for leronlimab in all HIV related indications with terms described in “Marketing and Sales Agreement” below. These rights were later assigned from Vyera to SevenScore. CytoDyn filed with the FDA the clinical and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) portions of the BLA in April and May of 2020. In July 2020, CytoDyn received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding the BLA filing, and a Type A meeting was held in September 2020 to discuss the re-submission with the FDA.
 
Overview
 
Leronlimab as a CCR5 Antagonist

SevenScore’s main focus is commercialization of a monoclonal antibody C—C chemokine receptor type 5 (“CCR5”) receptor antagonist, to be used as a platform drug for a variety of HIV indications. The target of leronlimab is the immunologic receptor CCR5. Leronlimab prevents certain strains of HIV from using the CCR5 receptor as an entry gateway for healthy cells. 
 
Leronlimab binds to the second extracellular loop and N-terminus of the CCR5 receptor, and due to its selectivity and target-specific mechanism of action, leronlimab does not appear to activate the immune function of the CCR5 receptor through agonist activity. This apparent target specificity differentiates leronlimab from other CCR5 antagonists.
 
Leronlimab and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”)
 
Leronlimab has shown promise as an antiviral agent with the advantage of fewer side effects, less toxicity and less frequent dosing requirements, as compared to daily drug therapies currently in use for the treatment of HIV. The leronlimab antibody belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. Leronlimab blocks HIV from entering a cell by binding to a molecule called CCR5, a normal cell surface receptor protein to which certain strains of HIV, referred to as “R5” strains, attach as part of HIV’s entry into a cell.
 
Leronlimab does not appear to affect the normal function of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV. Instead, leronlimab binds to a precise site on CCR5 that R5 strains of HIV use to enter the cell and, in doing so, inhibits the ability of these strains of HIV to infect the cell without appearing to affect the cell’s normal function. As a result, we believe leronlimab represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with advantageous virological and immunological properties and may provide a unique tool to treat HIV infected patients.

To date, leronlimab has been tested and administered to patients predominantly as a subcutaneous injection. We believe that if leronlimab is approved by the FDA for use as an injectable for HIV, it may be an attractive and marketable therapeutic option for patients, particularly in the following scenarios:
 

· | Patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies; 
· | Patients with compromised organ function, such as hepatitis C (“HCV”) co-infection; and
· | Patients with complex concomitant medical requirements. 

 
Clinical trials for leronlimab have demonstrated potent antiretroviral activity (as compared to optimized background therapy alone) and has demonstrated a clean safety profile. 
 
CytoDyn’s ongoing HIV-related clinical trials have been designed to demonstrate the proof of concept that leronlimab monotherapy can continue to suppress the viral load in certain HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients who had suppressed viral load on HAART, but would like an alternative treatment that provides a higher quality of life with one dose through a weekly self-injection. Once the viral load is undetectable, administration of leronlimab can help maintain the suppressed viral load in a subpopulation of R5 patients over an extended period of time (currently shown to be in excess of six years). 
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our commercial efforts may compete with more established biotechnology companies that have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do.
 
We face competition from both very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources, and small start-up organizations.  Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Our competitors may succeed in developing potential drugs or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our potential drug candidates. Worldwide, there are many antiviral drugs for treating HIV. SevenScore will face competition from established pharmaceutical companies. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, management expertise, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources and experience than we do.
 
Leronlimab blocks a cell receptor called CCR5, which is the entry point for most strains of HIV virus. ViiV Healthcare’s Maraviroc (Selzentry®) is the only currently approved CCR5 blocking agent. Maraviroc must be taken daily and is believed to have side effects and toxicity. For these reasons, we believe that leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody, may prove to be useful in patients that cannot tolerate existing HIV therapies or desire a respite from those therapies. Nonetheless, manufacturers of current therapies, such as Gilead Sciences, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ViiV Healthcare, are very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources. We expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share.
 
To construct a HAART regimen, three drugs from two classes of drugs are typically needed. Currently there are only five different classes of drugs from which four are primarily used to construct a HAART regimen. Each of these four classes of drugs has many drugs available in its respective class, except the entry inhibitor (“EI”) class, which has only four drugs available. 
 
Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements
 
The commercialization and licensing agreement between SevenScore and CytoDyn gives SevenScore the rights to market leronlimab in all HIV related indications in United States in exchange for milestones that include payment of $500,000 due upon BLA acceptance, $2,000,000 upon FDA approval and $1,000,000 upon first sale of leronlimab and a 50% royalty.

Intellectual Property
 
Protection of the Company’s and its partner’s intellectual property rights is important to our business. We may file patent applications in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan, European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of our business.
 
Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date. A U.S. patent, to be selected by the grantee upon receipt of FDA regulatory approval, may be subject to up to a five-year patent term extension in certain instances. While the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, most countries provide for a patent term of 20 years measured from the application filing date and some may also allow for patent term extension to compensate for regulatory approval delay. We pursue opportunities for seeking new meaningful patent protection on an ongoing basis. Through the agreement with CytoDyn, SevenScore will leverage CytoDyn’s existing leronlimab intellectual property to commercialize the product.
 
Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, record-keeping, distribution, import, export, promotion, advertising, marketing, sale, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, both pre-approval and post-approval, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business.
 
Licensure and Regulation of Biological Products in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates human drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and in the case of biological products, also under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. We believe that our products will be regulated as biological products, or biologics. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may result in FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs or delays in development and may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or civil or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
The FDA must approve our product candidates for therapeutic indications before they may be marketed in the United States. For biologic products, the FDA must approve a BLA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps: 
 

8


· | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations or other applicable regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated when certain changes are made; 
· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees; 
· | review of the BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA; and 
· | FDA review and approval of the BLA, which may be subject to additional post- approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and any post- approval studies required by the FDA. 

Manufacturing
 
SevenScore does not own or operate manufacturing facilities responsible for the production of leronlimab. As such, the Company must depend on CytoDyn and its third-party manufacturing organizations and suppliers for all our commercial grade quantities of leronlimab.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers and no other employees. The Company has several independent consultants assisting us with the Company’s upcoming launch. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify or hire and retain additional employees or consultants on acceptable terms in the future.
