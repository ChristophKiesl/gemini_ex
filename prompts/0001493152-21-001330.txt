Our clinical services’ customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics. Our largest customer for ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® products in 2019 was Laboratory Corporation of America® or LabCorp. Our revenue channels include reimbursement by Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and direct client billings (for example, hospitals and clinics), and commercial payers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare and others.
 
We partner with pharmaceutical and biotech companies and clinicians as oncology diagnostic specialists by supporting development and patient care from bench to bedside. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies work with us to provide molecular profiles on clinical trial participants. Similarly, we believe the oncology industry is undergoing a rapid evolution in its approach to diagnostic, prognostic and treatment outcome testing, embracing precision testing and individualized medicine as a means to drive higher standards of patient treatment and disease management. These profiles may help identify biomarker and genomic variations that may be targetable for developing novel personalized therapeutics or that may be responsible for differing responses to existing oncology therapies, thereby increasing the efficiency of trials while lowering costs. We believe tailored and combination therapies can revolutionize oncology care through molecular- and biomarker-based testing services, enabling physicians and researchers to target the factors that make each patient and disease unique. Our pharma services’ customers consist primarily of pharmaceutical and biotech companies.
 
Potential Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
 
We have taken what we believe are all necessary precautions to safeguard our employees from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We are following CDC guidance and local restrictions. All employees who do not work in a lab are currently on a telecommunication work arrangement. Our employees in the lab are wearing what we believe is appropriate protective gear. If an employee tests positive, then we will take necessary and available precautions in the lab to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19, including decontamination and temporary lab closures. There can be no assurance that key employees will not become ill or that we will able to continue to operate our labs. We have furloughed a significant number of employees as a result of reductions in customer demand and we have closed our administrative offices. Our management, finance staff and sales personnel have generally been able to successfully work remotely. Our labs require in-person staffing and as of the date of this report, we have been able to successfully operate our labs though a combination of social distancing and protective equipment.
 
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally is adversely affecting global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn which could materially and adversely impact our operations including, without limitation, the functioning of our laboratories, the availability of supplies including reagents, the progress and data collection of our pharma services, customer demand and travel and employee health and availability.
 
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2020 and possibly beyond. Our fiscal 2020 first quarter revenue has been impacted by lower than expected clinical service volume throughout March 2020. We believe this has resulted from the temporary reduction in non-essential testing procedures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. While we experienced a substantial increase in clinical services revenue compared to the first quarter of 2019, our March 2020 test volume decreased substantially compared to our February 2020 volume. Our pharma services preliminary first quarter revenue increased throughout the first quarter and average daily accessions improved in March 2020 as compared to January and February 2020. 
 
We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these dynamic circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. 
 
Currently volume of testing in our clinical services labs has slowed, as noted above, and we believe we have taken the necessary actions to support the lower volume. Our pharma services customers have indicated that there could be a slowdown in clinical trials but thus far volume has not suffered. All of our labs are currently operating and we believe we are appropriately staffed for the volume of work. At this time, we do not anticipate any lab closures beyond temporary work stoppages from time to time to clean and disinfect the labs. To date, we have not lost any of our customer base and we are not aware of any customers with potential bankruptcy or payment issues. Lab supplies including reagents have been secured to mitigate any potential supply chain issues for the foreseeable future and we are not observing any shortages due to supply chain issues. Our third party clinical services billing and collections company has taken steps to continue operations remotely. There have been indications that payer processing may slow down but so far there has been little or no material impact to our collections. 
 
As of April 21, 2020 we have approximately $18.4 million of cash on hand which includes $3.4 million drawn on our credit facility, $2.1 million in advances received under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) accelerated and advance payment program, and $0.65 million in the form of a grant received from the Department of Health and Human Services, which is subject to certain conditions regarding its use, including developing coronavirus and serology tests. Also as of April 21, 2020, the Company has maximized its borrowing under its line of credit facility and therefore has no further availability on its credit facility; however, we are in the process of seeking to expand availability under the credit facility from $4.0 to $8.0 million on terms similar to existing terms, but there can be no assurance that such credit line extension will be granted or that it will be granted on commercially reasonable and acceptable terms. As of the date of this report, the Company believes it will be able to access additional financing though commercial bank loans and the sale of its securities, although there can be no assurance that financing market conditions will not change or that such financing can be obtained. It is anticipated that if business conditions remain at these lower levels for clinical services customers and our pharma services customers similarly reduce their demand until the end of July and thereafter demand recovers to pre COVID-19 pandemic levels, then we believe we will have ample resources to continue to service our customers. However, should business conditions deteriorate further or last longer than anticipated, then our business may be materially and adversely affected.

The Company’s leadership team is monitoring the situation on a daily basis and has developed contingency plans to potentially mitigate the anticipated adverse financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These contingency plans include significant cost saving actions to offset any volume shortfall and additional action plans to react to further potential declines.
 
As of April 2020, we are in the process of launching a new product line of antibody testing for the COVID-19 virus. We are currently validating a serological, or antibody, test that measures the amount of antibodies present in the blood. In response to an infection, such as COVID-19, the body develops an overall immune response to fight the infection. One component of the immune system’s response is the development of antibodies that attach to the virus and help eliminate it. Antibody tests detect the body’s immune response to the infection caused by the virus rather than detecting the virus itself. The FDA has issued guidance allowing companies to market serological tests that have been validated following notification to FDA. Validated antibody tests offered under the policy should, among other things, include in test reports language explaining that negative results do not rule out COVID-19 infection and that follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or realize any revenue or benefit from these efforts.

United States Clinical Oncology Market
 
Despite many advances in the treatment of cancer, it remains one of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. In 2018, the World Health Organization attributed 9.6 million deaths globally to cancer, which is about one in six deaths. Within the United States, cancer is the second most common cause of death, exceeded only by heart disease, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that the direct medical treatment costs of cancer in the United States for 2015 were $80.2 billion. In the United States in 2020, it is expected that in total there will be approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed, which is the equivalent of approximately 4,950 new cases each day, according to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries’ (NAACCR) 2019 data. The incidence, deaths and economic loss caused by cancer are staggering. The following table published by The American Cancer Society shows estimated new cases and deaths in 2019 in the United States for selected major cancer types:

United States and International Clinical Trials Market Overview
 
The United States is currently a world leader in biopharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing. In fiscal year 2020, the National Cancer Institute received a budget of $6.44 billion, an increase of $297 million over fiscal year 2019, to issue grants to support research, with a targeted investment in enhanced and early detection of disease through the analysis of circulating biomarkers using minimally invasive methods, as well as a focused investment in cancer prevention and treatment including research on new vaccines to prevent cancer-causing infections and investigational immuno-oncology drugs and drug combinations. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) reports that the average cost to develop a drug, including trial failures, can be as high as $2.6 billion and the approval process from development to market may be as long as 15 years. According to the National Cancer Institute, since the 1990s, the overall cancer death rate in the United States has declined 27%, and approximately 83% of life expectancy increases in cancer patients are due to new treatments and oncology medications.
 
Outside of the United States, particularly in our targeted geographies of the Europe and Asia Pacific (“APAC”) regions, growth in the pharmaceuticals and clinical trials market is continuing. Growth in the European pharma market is anticipated to be driven largely by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France and Italy. The size of this market is expected to grow 25% between 2017 and 2022, and is expected to account for nearly 70% of the European pharma market by 2022. Germany is forecasted to have the highest increase in market value during this 5-year span. APAC’s location provides access to large patient pools within favorable regulatory environments, and a strong intellectual property regime and available infrastructure. APAC accounts for about 19% of the global clinical trial share, and is expected to reach 30% in the next five years. CAGR for APAC CROs is over 20%, making it the fastest growing CRO market in the world.
 
While oncology drugs have the potential to be among the most personalized therapeutics, very few have successfully made it to market. The application of pharmacogenomics to oncology clinical trials enables researchers to better predict differences in drug response, efficacy and toxicity among trial participants, as well as to optimize treatment regimens based on these differences. According to IMS Health, it is estimated that in 2020, one half of all pharmaceutical sales in the United States will be from specialty drugs, a category of drugs including oncology treatments tailored to patients’ genomic profiles. We believe a growing demand for faster development of personalized medicines and more effective clinical trials are growth drivers of this market, and our core expertise is pharmacogenomics, or the study of genetic analysis based on a patient’s response to a particular therapy or drug.
 
Our Strategy
 
Previously we were exclusively a molecular diagnostic company focused on delivering esoteric clinical tests to enable healthcare providers to better assess the risk of indeterminate biopsies progressing to cancer. The acquisition of the Biopharma business of Cancer Genetics, Inc. (“CGI”) in July 2019 expanded our focus to include molecular and other diagnostic platform testing specialty services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
 
Our primary goal is to become a leader in providing high quality and dependable personalized medicine with exceptional growth, Our strategy is to grow our business both organically as well as by selective partnering, which could potentially include licensing, acquisitions or mergers, to generate positive returns for our shareholders and driving towards cash flow break-even. We expect to not only continue to further develop our existing gastrointestinal and endocrine assays but to also expand our presence in other markets where we have expertise and access. Our existing customer base and broad-based capabilities provide us a unique window not only into our current customers’ needs but also permit us to anticipate their future needs.
 
The key tactics to achieve our goals include:
 

● | Expanding our existing commercial products, especially PancraGEN®, ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR®, focusing on personalized medicine and early intervention related to cancer risk; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Accelerating the clinical development and commercialization of BarreGEN®, our esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett’s Esophagus, working with our recently developed Key Opinion Leaders (“KOL’s”) and expanding clinical studies to seek key reimbursement support while seeking partners to collaborate with us; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consolidating facilities and related costs including leveraging and updating our Laboratory Information Systems (LIM’s) to provide timely and accurate lab information results; 
● | Broadening coverage and reimbursement for our clinical tests including: 


○ | Initiating and expanding studies to demonstrate that our tests are effective; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Meeting standards necessary to be consistent with leading clinical guidelines; 
○ | Executing by our internal managed care team; 
○ | Collaborating with KOL’s; and 
○ | Establishing payer relationship and in-network contracts serving our diagnostic customers. 


● | Targeting synergistic product and service opportunities developed for our clinical customers for use by our pharmaceutical and biotech customers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Developing and commercializing other related first-line clinical assays and expanding our service offerings such as PanDNA®, a DNA only version of PancraGEN®, and markers for aggressive thyroid cancer; 
● | Expanding our commercial sales staff rationally, while supporting our products with high quality data and studies; 
● | Expanding our bioinformatics data collected (currently from over 60,000 patients), utilizing registries to improve our assays and leveraging our data with potential collaborators; 
● | Expanding internationally; and 
● | Expanding our average contract revenue from pharmaceutical and biotech customers by growing our services and product offerings while providing dependable and timely service and unique solutions. 

 
The reliability of the volume growth from our clinical customers combined with more variable but scalable revenue from our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, we believe, provides the opportunity to expand our services and grow our business. We also believe that the synergistic opportunities of our businesses are important especially in targeted product categories where we have a history of clinical data and sample biorepositories as we expand our roster of pharmaceutical client opportunities. We also believe that our LIM’s systems, with the current investments we are making, is already an important tool to support our future growth as we begin to convert data into usable and unique information and insights for our customers’ benefit. Our unique commercial infrastructure focused on clinical and pharmaceutical customers is one of our most important assets and we anticipate expanding it in the future with highly trained commercial personnel that have growth potential and can effectively communicate our value proposition to our sophisticated customers. The information and analytics that we have, we believe, will help further differentiate us from our competitors.
 
Our Service Offerings
 
Our business is based on demand for molecular- and biomarker-based characterization of cancers from three main sectors: (1) physicians, hospitals and clinics, (2) biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and (3) the research community.
 
Clinicians and oncologists in cancer centers and hospitals seek molecular-based testing since these methods often produce higher value and more accurate cancer diagnostic information than traditional analytical methods. Our proprietary and unique disease-focused or esoteric tests aim to provide actionable information that can guide patient management decisions, potentially resulting in decreased costs.

Interpace Biosciences, Inc.
 Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
We continue to pursue the strategy of trying to demonstrate increased value and efficacy with payers who wish to contain costs and academic collaborators seeking to develop new insights and cures.
 
Our pharma services are sought by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in designing and running clinical trials, from pre-clinical to post market surveillance, for their value and efficacy in oncology and immuno-oncology treatments and therapeutics.
 
We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genomic and other molecular alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal, endocrine, and lung cancers. Our clinical services’ customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics.
 
Clinical services
 
Our clinical services develop and provide clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology and bioinformatics services. We develop and commercialize genomic tests and related first line assays principally focused on early detection of patients at high risk of cancer using the latest technology to help personalized medicine and improve patient diagnosis and management. Our tests and services provide mutational analysis of genomic material contained in suspicious cysts, nodules and lesions with the goal of better informing treatment decisions in patients at risk of thyroid, pancreatic, and other cancers. The molecular diagnostic tests we offer enable healthcare providers to better assess cancer risk, helping to avoid unnecessary surgical treatment in patients at low risk.
 
Our mission is to provide personalized medicine through genomics-based diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science. Our laboratories are licensed pursuant to federal law under CLIA and are accredited by College of American Pathologists (CAP) and our products are approved by New York State. We are leveraging our licensed and accredited laboratories to develop and commercialize our assays and products. We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genomic and other molecular alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal, endocrine, and other cancers. Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics.
 
We currently have four commercialized molecular diagnostic tests in the marketplace: PancraGEN®, which is a pancreatic cyst and pancreaticobiliary solid lesion genomic test that helps physicians better assess risk of pancreaticobiliary cancers using our proprietary PathFinderTG® platform; ThyGeNEXT®, which is an expanded oncogenic mutation panel that helps identify malignant thyroid nodules; ThyraMIR®, which, in combination with ThyGeNEXT, assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy utilizing a proprietary microRNA gene expression assay; and RespriDx®, which is a genomic test that helps physicians differentiate metastatic or recurrent lung cancer from the presence of newly formed primary lung cancer and which also utilizes our PathFinderTG® platform. We are gathering additional market data, performing clinical studies and working with our KOL’s to further develop and progress with BarreGEN®, an esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett’s Esophagus that also utilizes our PathFinderTG® platform.
 
Gastrointestinal Cancer Products
 
Our current gastrointestinal integrated pathology risk diagnostic assay, PancraGEN® is based on our PathFinderTG® platform, or PathFinderTG®. PathFinderTG® is designed to use advanced clinical algorithms to accurately stratify patients according to risk of pancreatic cancer by assessing panels of DNA abnormalities in patients who have pancreaticobiliary lesions (cysts or solid masses) with potential for cancer. PathFinderTG® is supported by our state of the art CLIA certified, and CAP accredited laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our Pittsburgh laboratory is our major clinical laboratory where we process the majority of our oncology related commercial tests; we also support our other gastrointestinal and endocrine commercial activities through this laboratory. Most of our development activities are initiated in our CLIA certified and CAP accredited laboratory in New Haven, CT.
 
Early detection of pancreatic cancer is crucial. As of March 2019, pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. with an average 5 year survival rate of 9.3% according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”s) SEER database. PancraGEN® is designed to determine risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and pancreaticobiliary solid lesions, which are more often than not benign lesions but have potential for cancer. We believe that PancraGEN® is the leader in the market for integrated molecular diagnostic tests for determining risk of pancreaticobiliary malignancy. We currently estimate that the immediate addressable market for PancraGEN® is approximately 130,000 indeterminate pancreaticobiliary lesions annually or approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population and reimbursement rates. To date, PancraGEN® has been used in about 40,000 clinical cases. The National Pancreatic Cyst Registry study published in Endoscopy in 2015 demonstrated that PancraGEN® more accurately determines the malignant potential of pancreatic cysts than international consensus 2012 imaging criteria, helping to ensure that surgery is reserved for the most appropriate patients. When molecular analysis is not performed, the vast majority of all pancreatic cysts surgeries are for those that do not harbor malignancy.

The American Gastroenterological Association 2015 Guidelines have cautioned that many pancreatic surgeries have been performed unnecessarily for lesions that will not progress to invasive adenocarcinoma. In addition, the 2016 guidelines published by the American Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy (ASGE) in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy included a specific recommendation for use of molecular testing in specific circumstances where other types of testing and analysis have not provided sufficient data on which to determine the best course of action for patient treatment. Accordingly, we believe that PancraGEN® provides a highly reliable diagnostic and prognostic option that identifies cancer risk in circumstances where risk of cancer is otherwise uncertain.
 
We have also developed a cancer risk classifier assay, BarreGEN®, which is designed to evaluate patients with Barrett’s esophagus, an upper gastrointestinal condition that can progress into esophageal cancer. BarreGEN®, which is also run on our PathFinderTG® platform, is distributed today on a limited basis through our CEP or Clinical Experience Program allowing us to gather additional data, perform clinical studies and seek initial reimbursement. We preliminarily estimate that the total Barrett’s risk assessment market is approximately $0.7 to $1.3 billion annually based on the current size of the patient population and anticipated reimbursement rates. We are currently assessing the opportunity to partner BarreGEN®, while simultaneously working to gather sufficient data to gain insurance reimbursement for BarreGEN® in 2020.
 
Endocrine Cancer Products
 
We currently market and sell a dual platform endocrine cancer risk diagnostic assay. The incidence of thyroid nodules is on the rise. ThyGeNEXT® is a next generation DNA and RNA sequencing oncogene and mRNA fusion panel that is used to evaluate indeterminate thyroid biopsies. ThyGeNEXT® works synergistically with our second endocrine cancer diagnostic test ThyraMIR®, which is based on measuring the relative expression of ten distinct microRNAs. The combination of ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® is designed to provide a highly sensitive “rule-in” and “rule-out” test to accurately risk stratify indeterminate thyroid nodules.
 
Our testing is performed in our state of the art Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified; College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. CLIA is a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA in order to perform testing on human specimens, unless they fall within an exception to CLIA certification, such as research laboratories that test human specimens but do not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of any disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of individual patients. CLIA certification is also required to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, for diagnostic testing and services. In addition, proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of an accredited program under CLIA so that they can be offered in a CLIA-certified laboratory. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Our pharma services laboratories have current certificates under CLIA to perform high complexity testing and our pharma services laboratories are accredited by CAP, one of seven CLIA-approved accreditation organizations. For renewal of CLIA certification, clinical laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of clinical laboratories outside of the renewal process.
 
We estimate the total market for our endocrine cancer assays is approximately $300 million annually based on the current size of the patient population, estimated numbers of indeterminate biopsies and reimbursement rates. ThyGeNEXT® is used by some customers as a base line oncogene panel assessment and greater than 85% of such users will reflex to ThyraMIR® for a more specific evaluation.
 
Endocrinologists evaluate most thyroid nodules for possible cancer by collecting cells through Fine Needle Aspirants (FNA’s) that are then analyzed by cytopathologists to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancerous. While we have been previously validated for both FNA and slide biopsies, in 2018 we obtained multiple slide customers that were previously working with Rosetta Genomics Ltd., a molecular diagnostics company, prior to their bankruptcy. It is estimated that approximately 20% or well over 100,000 biopsies analyzed annually yield indeterminate results, meaning they cannot be diagnosed as definitely being malignant or benign by cytopathology alone. In the past, guidelines recommended that some patients with indeterminate cytopathology results undergo surgery to remove all or part of their thyroid to obtain an accurate diagnosis by looking directly at the thyroid tissue. According to a study published by Wang, et al. in 2011, in approximately 77% of these cases, the thyroid nodule proves to be benign.

Lung Cancer Product—RespriDx® Test and Metastatic versus Primary Platform
 
RespriDx® compares the mutational fingerprint of two or more sites of cancer to determine whether the neoplastic deposits are representative of a recurrence (metastasis) of lung cancer or a new primary or independent tumor. The test, which currently provides only nominal revenues, defines the presence or absence of cancer in atypical cytology by comparing the mutational profile with that of known previous cancer. RespriDx® assists in determining the most appropriate course of treatment, whether chemotherapy, surgery, or other modalities.
 
Pharma services
 
We provide data driven solutions for pharmaceutical and biotech companies engaged in clinical trials and we focus on providing these clients with oncology specific and non-oncology genetic testing services for phase I-IV clinical trials along with critical support of ancillary services. These ancillary services include: biorepository, clinical trial logistics, clinical trial design, bioinformatics analysis, customized assay development. DNA and RNA extraction and purification, genotyping, gene expression, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and FISH and biomarker analyses. We also seek to apply our expertise in laboratory developed tests to assist in developing and commercializing drug-specific companion diagnostics. We have established business relationships with key instrument manufacturers to provide a multi-omic approach, and to drive acceptance among biopharmaceutical sponsors developing innovative immuno-oncology therapies.
 
We also utilize our pharma services laboratories to provide clinical trial services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries to improve the efficiency and economic viability of clinical trials. Our clinical trials services leverage our knowledge of clinical oncology and molecular diagnostics and our laboratories’ fully integrated capabilities. We believe our pharma services operate one of only a few laboratories with the capability to combine somatic and germline mutational analyses in clinical trials.
 
Our pharma services operate through CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratories located in Rutherford, NJ and Raleigh, NC.
 
Industry research has shown many promising drugs have produced disappointing results in clinical trials. For example, a 2016 article by the University of Michigan reported that only 1 in 50 cancer drug candidates make it to the clinical market. Given such a high failure rate of oncology drugs, combined with constrained budgets for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, there is a significant need for drug developers to utilize molecular diagnostics to decrease these failure rates. For specific molecular-targeted therapeutics, the identification of appropriate biomarkers indicative of disease type or prognosis may help to optimize clinical trial patient selection and increase trial success rates by helping clinicians identify patients that are most likely to benefit from a therapy based on their individual genomic profile.
 
From a laboratory infrastructure standpoint, we possess capabilities in histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, cytogenetics and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as sophisticated molecular analysis techniques, including next generation sequencing. This allows for comprehensive esoteric testing within one lab enterprise, with our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory serving as a central hub for specimen tracking. Using this approach, we are able to support demanding clinical trial protocols requiring multiple assays and techniques aimed at capturing data on multiple biomarkers. Our suite of available testing platforms allows for highly customized clinical trial design which is supported by our dedicated group of development scientists and technical personnel.
 
Through this combination of a variety of testing platforms powered by a team of experienced scientists, we offer a comprehensive approach to clinical trial support. As trial design becomes increasingly complex to cater to more specific drug targets and patient populations, we believe that clinical result generation and reporting through a single-source solution for testing is becoming more valuable than ever. Examples of clinical trial services offered by our pharma services include:
 

Flow cytometry | Selection of individual antibodies in multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphomas, and therapy response. 
-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyotyping | Genome-wide detection of aberrations at low resolution that have a diagnostic or prognostic significance.

In February of 2020, ClinicalTrials.gov reported over 40,000 clinical trials that are either preparing or recruiting patients. Molecular- and biomarker-based testing services have been altering the clinical trials landscape by providing biotech and pharmaceutical companies with information about trial subjects’ genetic profiles that may be able to inform researchers whether or not a subject will benefit from the trial drug or will experience adverse effects. We believe that streamlined subject selection and stratification and tailored therapies selected to maximally benefit each group of subjects may increase the number of trials that result in approved therapies and make conducting clinical trials more efficient and less costly for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. According to the FDA, 2019 produced over 48 new drug approvals and over 20% of these drugs were oncology-focused, highlighting the potential value of incorporating genomic information into oncology clinical trial design.
 
We also provide genetic testing for drug metabolism to aid biotech and pharmaceutical companies identify subjects’ likely responses to treatment, allowing these companies to conduct more efficient and safer clinical trials. We believe pharmacogenomics drug metabolism testing helps deliver the promise of personalized medicine by enabling researchers to tailor therapies in development to differences in patients’ genomic profiles.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing efforts consist of both direct and indirect sales channels with the majority of efforts focused on direct sales in the United States as well as a collaborative arrangement with another laboratory services company. In the US, pharma services also execute an indirect channel partner strategy by partnering with clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to support demand for unique or esoteric testing, customized data management and individual development of unique biomarkers.

Our commercialization efforts for our clinical services are currently focused on endocrinology, gastroenterology and lung cancers. Communication of our marketing messaging and value proposition is done principally through our two field-based commercial sales teams of approximately 26 representatives and managers. In addition, we employ medical science liaisons or MSLs to respond to clinician inquiries. Additionally, we communicate through print, digital advertising, a web presence, peer-reviewed publications, and trade show exhibits. We believe that our molecular diagnostic tests provide value to payers, physicians and patients by improving patient care and lowering healthcare costs through avoidance of unnecessary surgeries, reducing the morbidity associated with unnecessary surgeries for patients, and providing better diagnostic and prognostic insights to physicians. We support the value propositions of our tests through rigorous science and the accumulation of bioinformatics data that demonstrate clinical and analytical validity as well as clinical utility, and how they actually impact physicians’ decisions. We believe our repository of bioinformatics data accumulated in over 37,000 cases using PancraGEN and over 30,000 cases using our thyroid assays is a valuable tool in developing our analytics and potentially an even more valuable tool in the future.
 
We communicate to payers, integrated delivery systems and hospital systems about our molecular diagnostic tests’ value through highly trained professionals who are experienced in reimbursement and business to business selling and through face to face meetings, phone calls, digital communications and advisory boards. We develop health economic analyses and budget impact models and incorporate these along with our clinical validation studies, and clinical utility studies to demonstrate our molecular diagnostic tests’ value to this distinct and important constituency.
 
Our U.S. pharma services business development and sales professionals have scientific backgrounds in hematology, pathology, and laboratory services, with many years of experience in biopharmaceutical and clinical oncology sales, esoteric laboratory sales from leading biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical or specialty reference laboratory companies. We currently have a team of 6 business development and sales professionals in the United States. We support our sales force with scientific experts who bring deep domain knowledge in the design and use of our technologies and services.
 
Our pharma services team also executes an indirect channel partner strategy. As a result of this strategy, the pharma services team conducts project support for sponsors as a partner of such central labs as Covance, ICON Laboratories Inc. and Parexel International Corp. In addition to both direct and indirect sales channels, the pharma services team has formed a partnership with the China-based lab partner Genecast Biotechnology Co., Ltd. or, Genecast. Through our partnership with Genecast, we believe we are able to support our global pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients with their testing needs in the Chinese market.
 
We also promote our tests and services through marketing channels commonly used by the biopharma and pharmaceutical industries, such as internet, industry meetings and broad-based publication of our scientific and economic data. In addition, we provide easy to access information to our customers over the internet through dedicated websites. Our customers value easily accessible information in order to quickly review patient or study information. We do not, however, market our tests directly to individual patients or consumers.
 
Clinical Services Reimbursement Coverage
 
Additional Reimbursement Coverage During 2019
 
Reimbursement progress is key for our clinical services. We expanded the reimbursement of our products in 2019. Specifically, the most significant progress we have made regarding payers in 2019 and 2020 is as follows:

● | In January 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with the University of Maryland Medical System (“UMMS”) to provide physicians’ access to ThyGeNEXT®, ThyraMIR®, and PancraGEN® across the UMMS network, which includes 4,000 affiliated physicians who provide primary and specialty care in more than 150 locations and at 14 hospitals.

● | In June 2019, we announced that our ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests are now covered by Independence Blue Cross (“Independence”), providing plan benefits coverage for its members who meet established medical criteria for the tests. Independence covers nearly 2.5 million members in Philadelphia and Southeastern Pennsylvania. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In July 2019, we announced that we reached an agreement with SelectHealth (a plan associated with Intermountain Healthcare) (“SelectHealth”) to provide ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® to SelectHealth’s more than 850,000 members in Utah and Idaho. 
● | In July 2019, we announced we had entered into a contract with Blue Shield of California, making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests in-network services for their 4 million lives. 
● | In July 2019, we announced that we contracted with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan for coverage of our thyroid tests. The contract makes the ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests both covered services as well as in-network services for their total of approximately 6.1 million members. 
● | In September 2019, we announced that we contracted with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, Arkansas and Arizona, making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests in-network services for nearly 5 million members. 
● | In December 2019, we announced the issuance of a draft local coverage determination (LCD) which indicated a potential increase in our Medicare reimbursement rate for ThyGeNEXT® from $597.91 to $2,919.60 per test (per the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, clinical lab fee schedule), reflecting the expansion of the ThyGeNEXT® panel to aid in identifying the appropriate patients for surgery. 

Additional Reimbursement Coverage During 2020
 

● | In February 2020, we announced an increase in Medicare reimbursement for our ThyraMIR® test from $1,800 to $3,000, retroactive to January 1, 2020, reflecting a re-evaluation of the technical and clinical performance of the test relative to other molecular tests in the market and their respective prices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In March 2020, we announced we had entered into a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests covered in-network services for their more than 3 million members in Massachusetts and across New England. 
● | In March 2020, we announced we had entered into a contract with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests covered in-network services for their more than 3.3 million members in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia. 
● | In March 2020, we announced we had entered into a contract with Premera Blue Cross, making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests covered in-network services for their more than 2 million members in Washington State and Alaska. 
● | In April 2020, we executed an agreement with Avalon Healthcare Solutions (Avalon), a laboratory benefit manager representing numerous health plans. Our agreement with Avalon offers us in-network status to approximately 5.8 million lives covered by the following health plans: Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas City and Vermont, and Capital Blue Cross of Central Pennsylvania 
● | In April 2020, we executed a contract with Blue Cross of Idaho making ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® tests covered in-network services for their more than 576 thousand members. 

Competition
 
We compete on the basis of factors such as reputation, scientific expertise, service quality, management experience, performance record, customer satisfaction, accessibility, flexibility, ability to respond to specific customer needs, integration skills, and product portfolio and price. Increased competition and/or a decrease in demand for our clinical and pharma services may also lead to other forms of competition. We believe that our business has a variety of competitive advantages that allow us to compete successfully in the marketplace. While we believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors, certain competitors of ours are substantially larger than us and have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broader product lines outside of the molecular diagnostic testing market, and many have greater brand recognition than we do. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue. Increased competition may lead to pricing pressures and competitive practices that could have a material adverse effect on our market share and our ability to attract new business opportunities as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We also compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies, surveillance or surgery to determine if a patient’s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices and continue to support the use of molecular diagnostic tests in clinical guidelines.

Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, has a molecular thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic test (Afirma) that is the current market leader and competes with our ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMir® tests. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGeNEXT® test and announced an agreement to distribute the Afirma test in partnership with Veracyte. CBLPath, Inc., or CBL, is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing. In addition, other thyroid based endocrine competitors include Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., or other companies we are not aware of. Additionally, in February 2020 we entered into an arrangement to co-market our thyroid test for an additional two years with LabCorp on a reference laboratory basis.
 
We are currently not aware of any direct competitors to PancraGEN® that integrate clinical, imaging, cytology, and molecular information to stratify patients’ risk for malignancy and inform physicians on the best course of action, i.e. surgery or surveillance and surveillance interval length. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center now offers PancreaSeq®, a Next Generation Sequencing “gene only” panel that focuses on the analysis of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, most of which may help establish the type of pancreatic cyst present and some of which may help establish the presence of malignancy. Some of these related genomic regions are included in PancraGEN®. This laboratory test however does not integrate any additional information to fully characterize a patient’s risk for pancreatic cancer. Importantly, there has been no long-term clinical validation or utility studies completed on any gene panel for pancreatic cyst fluid other than that associated with PancraGEN®. PancraGEN® has been validated in multiple studies and peer reviewed publications and has been used in over 45,000 patients. Additionally, we validated and launched a DNA only version of PancraGEN®, known as PanDNA®.
 
It is also possible that we face future competition from other laboratory-developed tests (LDT’s), developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and other diagnostic companies developing new tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of new, unforeseen technologies that may be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.
 
We are aware of companies that are in the process of developing assays and LDTs for Barrett’s esophagus, such as Cernostics Inc. In addition, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc., or NeoGenomics, is marketing a Barrett’s assay, so it appears likely that this space will also be more competitive in the future.
 
With respect to pharma services, we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing products to profile genes, gene expression or protein biomarkers in various cancers. Precision medicine is a new area of science, and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results superior to the results we are able to achieve with the tests we develop. Our competitors include public companies such as NeoGenomics, and many private companies.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct most of our research and development activities at our CLIA certified and CAP accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. Our research and development efforts primarily focus on providing data and analyses necessary to support and improve our existing products on the market. Additionally, our research and development activities provide product line extension of our existing products as well as new product opportunities utilizing our proprietary platforms and extensive bioinformatics repositories and data bases.
 
Also, we use reagents for cross site validations and validations of new assays to be used in clinical trials. We may enter into collaborative relationships with research and academic institutions for the development of additional or enhanced tests to further increase the depth and breadth of our test offerings. Where appropriate, we may also enter into licensing agreements with our collaborative partners to both license intellectual property for use in our test panels as well as licensing such intellectual property out.
 
Our research and development costs are primarily clinical costs and were approximately $2.8 million and $2.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Analytical Validation of ThyGeNEXT was accepted in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics on November 18, 2019. This peer reviewed article detailed the development of our laboratory-developed ThyGeNEXT test, highlighting the key aspects of the test’s reproducibility, lower limit of detection, as well as other fundamental quality parameters. 
● | A peer-reviewed manuscript was published in 2019 based on a 2018 clinical experience study that supports the use of BarreGEN® as an effective tool at identifying patients with Barrett’s Esophagus at higher risk of progression to more advanced stages of disease associated with esophageal cancer, supporting the utility of BarreGEN® as an effective biomarker in identifying Barrett’s patients in need of closer surveillance or cancer preventative measures. (Trindade AJ, et al. BMJ Open Gastro 2019;6:e000268. doi:10.1136/bmjgast-2018-000268). 
● | A peer-reviewed manuscript was published in 2018 describing the validity and utility of combination ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® in microdissected stained cytology slides, providing physicians a useful alternative specimen type for combination molecular testing of indeterminate thyroid nodules. (Kumar G, et al. Diagnostic Cytopathology. 2018; 1-8. DOI: 10.1002/dc.24100). 
● | In 2018, data from a large clinical experience study of over 300 patients was presented at the 88th Annual Meeting of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) with conclusions highlighting the clinical utility of the ThyGenX® thyroid oncogene panel in combination with its micro-RNA classifier, ThyraMIR®. (Sistrunk JW, et al. American Thyroid Association 88th Annual meeting. 2018. Short Call Poster 42: https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2018.29065.abstracts). 
● | In 2018, new data was published at the 88th Annual Meeting of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) describing the validity of combination ThyGeNEXT® and ThyraMIR® testing. (Kumar G, et al. American Thyroid Association 88th Annual meeting. 2018. Poster 86: https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2018.29065.abstracts). 
● | A peer-reviewed manuscript was published in 2018 describing a large study of 478 patients with pancreatic cysts, which concluded that DNA analysis using PancraGEN® can have a favorable impact on patient outcomes particularly in patients with cysts that have worrisome features, supporting more accurate surgery and surveillance decisions in such clinical scenarios. (Farrell JJ, et al. GIE. 2018. doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2018.10.049). 
● | A peer-reviewed manuscript was published in 2018 supporting the diagnostic accuracy and comparative diagnostic accuracy of PancraGEN® to gold standard cytology testing and gold standard molecular testing using FISH methods for diagnosing malignancy in solid pancreaticobiliary lesions. In this prospective study of 101 patients the authors found that PancraGEN® testing of specimens obtained during routine endoscopic procedures improved detection of pancreaticobiliary malignancy and improved diagnostic yield of each endoscopic procedure compared to use of gold standard testing alone. (Kushnir VM et al. J Clin Gastroenterol. 2018. doi: 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001118). 
● | A clinical experience study was published in 2018 describing the utilization, diagnostic accuracy, and comparative diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive value (including follow-up) of PancraGEN® compared to cytology testing for diagnosing malignancy in solid pancreaticobiliary lesions.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to us. We generate our own intellectual property portfolio and hold numerous patents and patent applications covering our existing and future products and technologies. As of December 31, 2019, we owned six issued United States Patents. The U.S. patents are directed to methods of treating a patient that has pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using the expression pattern of certain microRNAs to identify the patient as having PDAC; treating the identified patient and to methods of measuring carcinoembryonic antigen in a biological sample; methods for treating subject with a high risk of disease progression from Barrett’s metaplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma; and methods of treating a subject identified with a papillary thyroid carcinoma. As of December 31, 2019, we owned eight issued patents outside of the United States, two each in Australia, Europe (validated in certain European countries), and Japan, and one each in Israel and Canada. As of December 31, 2019, we owned eleven pending patent applications in the United States and one pending patent application in each of Brazil, Canada, and Israel. Provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, our issued United States patents expire from 2031 through 2034 and our foreign patents expire in 2027 or 2031, and our pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2038, absent any disclaimers, adjustments or extensions. On March 29, 2017 we were notified by the European Patent Office that our EP patent # 2772550 for diagnosing thyroid cancer from a sample based upon at least MIR-375 was issued (validated in Spain, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands) and, provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, expires in 2031. On January 16, 2018, we were notified that an Opposition had been filed against EP patent # 2772550 alleging that the patent is invalid. On February 25, 2019, the European Patent Office Opposition Division issued a decision revoking the patent on grounds that the claims were not supported by a valid basis. On April 25, 2019 we filed a Notice of Appeal challenging the European Patent Office Opposition Division and we are waiting for the appeal to be decided. We continue to believe that the patent is valid. Our patents are directed to certain of the technologies relating to detecting, diagnosing, and classifying thyroid tumors, pancreatic cysts and other forms of gastrointestinal disorders, such as Barrett’s esophagus.
 
On April 9, 2019 the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,255,410, supporting BarreGEN®. Additionally, United States Patent No. 10,444,239 issued on October 15, 2019, for methods measuring carcinoembryonic antigen in a biological sample.
 
In addition to our own molecular diagnostic test development efforts, we are currently using, and intend to use in the future, certain tests and biomarkers that have been developed by third parties or by us in collaboration with third parties. While a significant amount of intellectual property in the field of molecular diagnostic tests is already in the public domain, ThyraMIR®, ThyGeNEXT®, and some of the future tests developed by us, or by third parties on our behalf for use in our tests, may require, that we license the right to use certain intellectual property from third parties and pay customary royalties or make one time payments.
 
On August 13, 2014, we consummated an agreement to acquire certain fully developed thyroid and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, associated intellectual property and a biobank with more than 5,000 patient tissue samples pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, or the Asuragen Asset Purchase Agreement. We paid $8.0 million at closing and paid an additional $0.5 million to Asuragen for certain integral transition service obligations set forth in a transition services agreement, entered into concurrently with the Asuragen Asset Purchase Agreement. We also entered into two license agreements with Asuragen (the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement) relating to our ability to sell the fully developed diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owed a $500,000 milestone payment, all of which was paid in installments throughout 2016 and paid in full as of January 13, 2017. We are further obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of tests based on the miRInform® pancreas platform, if developed, on the future net sales of tests based on the miRInform® thyroid platform (i.e., ThyGeNEXT®) and potentially on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests. We rely on Asuragen as our sole supplier for certain components of our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests pursuant to our supply agreement with them.
 
In October 2014, we acquired RedPath Integrated Pathology Inc. (RedPath) which included its pancreatic and gastrointestinal assets. Additionally, we have a broad and growing trademark portfolio. We have secured trademark registrations for the marks AccuCEA® (or TM), PancraGEN®, PanDNA®, BarreGEN® and miRInform® in the United States, and miRInform® with the World Intellectual Property Organization. In July 2019, in connection with the acquisition of the BioPharma business of Cancer Genetics we acquired certain know-how.

 Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
Our clinical and our pharma services rely on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary processes to protect our intellectual property. We enter into non-disclosure agreements with certain vendors and suppliers to attempt to ensure the confidentiality of our intellectual property. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers. In addition, we require that all our employees sign confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements.
Raw Material and Suppliers
 
We procure reagents, equipment and other materials that we use to perform our tests from sole suppliers. We also purchase components used in our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. Our most significant suppliers for reagents and supplies include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illumina, Inc., Qiagen, Asuragen, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for most of these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the tests and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications or are otherwise unusable, if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, or if we elect to change suppliers, an interruption in test processing could occur, we may not be able to deliver patient reports and we may incur higher one-time switching costs. Any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue, cause us to incur higher costs, and harm our customer relationships and reputation. In addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available. If our test volume decreases or we switch suppliers, we may hold excess inventory with expiration dates that occur before use which would adversely affect our losses and cash flow position. As we introduce any new test, we may experience supply issues as we ramp test volume. During the first three months of Fiscal 2020, we acquired additional reagents beyond our normal purchasing patterns to minimize the possibility of supply chain disruptions for both our clinical and pharma services, however, there can be no guarantee that this will be sufficient.
Government Regulations and Industry Guidelines
 
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive Federal, State, local and foreign regulation. Both Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business and most frequently cited in enforcement actions.
Regulations over Our Clinical Laboratories
 
The conduct and provision of our clinical services and pharma services are regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (“CLIA”). CLIA requires us to maintain Federal certification. CLIA imposes requirements relating to test processes, personnel qualifications, facilities and equipment, recordkeeping, quality assurance and participation in proficiency testing. CLIA compliance and certification are also a condition for participation by clinical laboratories in the Medicare Program and for eligibility to bill for services provided to governmental healthcare program beneficiaries. As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a State agency), or, if the laboratory is accredited, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to meet these certification, accreditation and licensure requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certification, accreditation or license, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s ability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as imposition of plans to correct deficiencies, injunctive actions and civil monetary and criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could harm our business. In addition to CLIA requirements, we participate in the oversight program of the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”). Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA.
 
In addition to CLIA certification, we are required to hold state licenses in certain states. Some state licensing requirements differ from federal regulation and may be stricter. CLIA does not preempt state laws that are more stringent. If we were to lose our CLIA certification, CAP Accreditation, or required state licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to provide our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Annual Report on Form 10-K
 
Our laboratories are also subject to licensing and regulation under Federal, State and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our laboratories are subject to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the National Fire Protection Agency. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of hazardous waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such Federal, State and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 
Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)
 
Both United States Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the Federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of LDTs. While subject to oversight by CMS through its enforcement of CLIA, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratories that produce LDTs, a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used in clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States.
 
The FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion over all LDTs. However, in October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers would be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers would be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA’s approval before an LDT may be marketed, or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. If the FDA were to regulate LDTs as proposed under the 2014 draft guidance documents, then it would classify LDTs into one of three classes according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Class III devices are those devices which are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. Under the guidance documents, LDTs would also be subject to significant post-market requirements as well.
 
On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not release the final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review.

The discussion paper notes that FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs will be made publically available. LDTs are encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.
 
Despite the FDA decision to not release the guidance at this time, it can choose to regulate LDTs at any time. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. There are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements if ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA certification of accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.
 
In March 2017, a draft bill “The Diagnostics Accuracy and Innovation Act” (DAIA) was introduced in Congress. The bill sought to establish a new regulatory framework for the oversight of in vitro clinical tests (“IVCTs”) which include LDTs. In 2020, Congress introduced “The Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development Act” (VALID) of 2020. Pursuant to it, a risk-based approach will be used to regulate IVCTs while grandfathering existing IVCTs. The new regulatory framework will include quality control and post-market reporting requirements. The FDA will have the authority to withdraw from the market IVCTs that present an unreasonable and substantial risk of severe illness or injury when used as intended.
 
Healthcare, Fraud, Abuse and Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 for each offense in the case of individuals and $500,000 for each offense in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Statute result in mandatory exclusion from federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Actions, which violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 
Although the Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits similar conduct toward all other health plans and third-party payers. Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations. Further, the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs.

We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents. These restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
 
Persons or entities found to violate the Stark Law are required to refund any payments received pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payer or the Medicare program, as applicable. Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
 

● | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law; 
● | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral; 
● | possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and 
● | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition. 

 
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
 
Additionally, the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.
 
We do retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of the business. These arrangements as any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. Our arrangements with healthcare providers are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark laws, respectively. There is no guarantee that the government will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA Laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law; and there is no guarantee that the government will not have issue with the relationships between the laboratories and the healthcare providers.
 
HIPAA, Fraud and Privacy Regulations
 
The Federal government’s efforts to combat fraud in the healthcare setting were consolidated and strengthened under Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA established a comprehensive program to combat fraud committed against all health plans, both public and private by, among other things creating two new Federal offenses: healthcare fraud (18 U.S. Code § 1347) and false statements relating to healthcare matters (18 U.S. Code § 1035). These provisions prohibit: (1) the knowing and willful execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice (a) to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payers), or (b) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; and (2) the knowing and willful (a) falsification, concealment or covering up of a material fact by any trick, scheme or device, or (b) making of any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of these provisions is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.

HIPAA, along with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” The regulations promulgated under HIPAA govern: the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, restricting the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.500, et seq.); Administrative Requirements for electronic transactions, establishing standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures (45 C.F.R. §§ 162.100, et seq.); Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, requiring covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.302, et seq.); and Breach Notification, requiring covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.400, et seq.). As a covered entity, and also in our capacity as a business associate to certain of our customers, we are subject to these standards. While the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us, and our failure to comply could lead to enforcement action that could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA or its implementing regulations, we may be subject to potentially significant penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines.
 
In addition to Federal regulations issued under HIPAA, many States and foreign jurisdictions have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
 
“Affordable Care Act”
 
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance and coverage for patients, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, coordinate and promote research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, and impose additional health policy reforms. PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on pricing and implemented changes which significantly affect the pharmaceutical, medical device and clinical laboratory industries. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs. Under the current administration and Congress, there have been efforts to make additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the PPACA. It is unclear what impact such legislative changes will have on the availability of healthcare and/or containing or lowering the costs of healthcare.
Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement for our Clinical Services
 
Our customers’ bills are paid by many different payer groups. The majority of reimbursement dollars for traditional laboratory services are provided by traditional commercial insurance products, most notably preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, and other managed care plans, as well as government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. PPOs, HMOs and other managed care plans typically contract with a limited number of laboratories and then designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. We are currently an out-of-network provider with most payers, which means we do not have a contract with payers to pay a specific rate for our tests. We did previously announce a new national agreement with Aetna through which the Company is now an in-network provider for Aetna’s members. We are subject to applicable State laws regarding who should be billed, how they should be billed, how business should be conducted, and how patient obligations regarding cost sharing should be handled. In addition, if we become an “in-network” provider for certain payers in the future, we will also be subject to the terms of contracts (which could include reduced reimbursement rates) and may be subject to discipline, breach of contract actions, non-renewal or other contractually provided remedies for non-compliance with the contract’s requirements and/or applicable laws.

We generally bill third-party payers and individual patients for testing services on a test-by-test basis. Third-party payers include Medicare, private insurance companies, institutional direct clients and Medicaid, each of which has different billing requirements. Medicare reimbursement programs are complex and often ambiguous, and are continuously being evaluated and modified by CMS. Our ability to receive timely reimbursements from third-party payers is dependent on our ability to submit accurate and complete billing statements, and/or correct and complete missing and incorrect billing information. Missing and incorrect information on reimbursement submissions slows down the billing process and increases the aging of accounts receivable. We must bill Medicare directly for tests performed for Medicare patients and must accept Medicare’s fee schedule for the covered tests as payment in full. State Medicaid programs are generally prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule. We have contracted with a healthcare billing services management company to work with our in-house staff and help manage our third-party billing.
 
Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians). Since 2018 several private payers implemented pre-authorization requirements for molecular and genetic testing, including Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare, as well as various lab benefit companies such as American Imaging Management, Inc., or AIM, and Beacon Lab Benefits Solutions, or Beacon. In addition, more commercial payers are contracting with and delegating risk for lab services costs to lab benefits management companies (e.g. eviCore healthcare, AIM, and Beacon). This requires us to go through their technology assessment process to secure coverage and obtain a contract as an in-network lab provider for our services. We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems. Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage.
 
As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with Federal and State healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments are reimbursed by us. As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.
 
Historically, due to the nature of our business, we have performed requested testing and have reported test results regardless of collectability or form of reimbursement. We submit claims for reimbursement on a best efforts basis including the use of a third-party revenue cycle management firm. If at times the billing information is incorrect or incomplete, we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process and may also impact revenue recognition. The increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information, and we are seeking to electronically integrate with more and more payers and clients. During 2017 we successfully implemented numerous electronic interfaces with providers to expedite the ordering and reporting process and increased the number of clients interacting with us via our customer portal.
 
There are a number of factors that influence coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic tests. In the United States, the American Medical Association assigns specific CPT codes, which are necessary for reimbursement of molecular diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under Medicaid and Medicare, and private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. However, the availability of a CPT code is not a guarantee of coverage or adequate reimbursement levels, and the revenues generated from our tests will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 
United States and other government regulations governing coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing may affect, directly or indirectly, the design of our tests and the potential market for their use. The availability of third-party reimbursement for our tests and services may be limited or uncertain. Third-party payers may deny coverage if they determine that the tests or service has not received appropriate FDA or other government regulatory clearances, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payer, or is deemed by the third-party payer to be experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Furthermore, third-party payers, including Federal and State healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, frequently challenge the prices, medical necessity, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare products and services, including laboratory tests. Such payers may limit coverage of our tests to specific, limited circumstances, may not provide coverage at all, or may not provide adequate reimbursement rates, if covered. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the test. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to maintain our revenue and growth. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.

Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical test services. For example, Medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients.
 
Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Certain Medicaid programs require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for diagnostic information services.
 
The Medicare Part B program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, has been subject to change. In April 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS’s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates began in 2017. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $12,500 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payer data from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, to CMS between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017. CMS posted the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payer rates) in November 2017 and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2018. The result of the PAMA calculations was an increase in our reimbursement rate for ThyGenX® of approximately 40% for our Medicare volume. However, on July 26, 2018, we received a coding update from CMS, which changed the billable procedure code (CPT) for ThyGeNEXT®. This code change resulted in a reduction of the fee schedule for payments to us. We have recently presented clinical data to CMS adding additional markers to the panel that we run that increase our gene families above 50. If approved, reimbursement for the new panel will exceed the previously approved rate. There can be no assurances that our request will be successful and that the rate will be escalated.
 
Any reductions to payment rates in the future resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates. Other than our chemistry testing services, our products are defined as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ADLTs) and therefore, we believe the pricing provisions of PAMA do not affect our marketed molecular diagnostic tests. The only testing for which we bill that is included in the CLFS is our carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Amylase chemistry testing services. For these services, we provided CMS with the median pricing received from all payers in compliance with PAMA regulations.
 
In December 2019, through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, Congress delayed the next data reporting period under PAMA from 2020 to 2021 for final payments made between January 1 and June 30, 2019, extending the applicability of the payment rates based on 2017 reporting by one year through December 31, 2021.
 
Penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. Civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act provides for penalties on a per violation basis, plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed.
 
Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Reimbursement from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenues during 2019. Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs. There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Commercial health plans that might not cover one or all of our tests for their commercially insured members are required to follow the Novitas LCD coverage policy for their Medicare Advantage members. To the extent we maintain the LCD coverage policies with Novitas for our products, any shift of members from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage plans doesn’t represent a risk of lost revenue. In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.

The current position of our laboratories is that they do not meet the definition of an “Applicable Manufacturer” under PPACA and therefore are not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. However, as new regulations are implemented and diagnostic tests reclassified, this may change and the laboratory business may be subject to PPACA as are other companies. There is no guarantee that our interpretation of the law is now or will be in the future consistent with government guidance and interpretation.
 
In December 2019, the our Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) issued a new draft local coverage determination (LCD) for our ThyGeNEXT® test, representing an increase of approximately $2,400 per assay over previous reimbursement coverage. This increase in reimbursement rates reflects the expansion of the ThyGeNEXT® panel to aid in identifying the appropriate patients for surgery. Final approval is expected during the first half of 2020. Additionally, in February 2020, the CMS modified the reimbursement for ThyraMIR® retroactively to January 1, 2020. This determination increases the Medicare reimbursement for ThyraMIR® from approximately $1,800 to $3,000 reflecting a re-evaluation of the technical and clinical performance of the test relative to other molecular tests in the market and their respective prices.
 
Reporting Segments
 
We operate under one segment which is the business of developing and selling diagnostic clinical and pharma services.
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2020, we had approximately 176 full time employees and 178 total employees. We are not party to a collective bargaining agreement with any labor union. However, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have furloughed a significant number of employees as a result of reductions in customer demand.
Corporate Information
 
We were originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1986 and began commercial operations as PDI, Inc., a contract sales organization or CSO in 1987. In connection with PDI, Inc.’s initial public offering, it reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. In 2015 the CSO business and assets were sold, and we operated our molecular diagnostics business as Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. (IDXG). On July 15, 2019, we acquired the Biopharma Business from the secured creditors of CGI and Gentris, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CGI and conduct our business as Interpace Pharma Solutions, Inc. We accordingly conduct our business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Interpace Diagnostics, LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013, Interpace Diagnostics Corporation (formerly known as RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc.), which was formed in Delaware in 2007, and Interpace BioPharma, Inc., which was formed in Delaware in 2019. On November 12, 2019 we changed the name of Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc. to Interpace Biosciences, Inc. and that of our newly-formed subsidiary, Interpace BioPharma, Inc. to Interpace Pharma Solutions, Inc.

Business Development
 
Biopharma Business Acquisition
 
On July 15, 2019, we entered into a Secured Creditor Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) to acquire certain assets and liabilities from the secured creditors of Cancer Genetics, Inc., or CGI and Gentris, LLC, or Gentris, a wholly owned subsidiary of CGI, for approximately $23.5 million less certain closing adjustments totaling $1,978,240 (the “Base Purchase Price”), of which $7,692,300 was paid in the form of a promissory note issued by a subsidiary of the Company to CGI (the “Excess Consideration Note”) and the remainder was paid in cash. In addition, we assumed certain liabilities totaling approximately $5 million. We acquired the Biopharma Business through a private foreclosure sale from CGI’s secured creditors under § 9-610 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in all relevant jurisdictions. Concurrently with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into a financing arrangement with Ampersand 2018 Limited Partnership (“Ampersand”), a fund managed by Ampersand Capital Partners, pursuant to which Ampersand agreed to provide the below described financing to us in connection with the acquisition of the referenced Biopharma Business.
 
On July 15, 2019, we also entered into a transition services agreement with CGI to accommodate the transition of the Biopharma Business. Under the transition services agreement, each party is providing (or has provided) to the other party certain services, among other things, which include but are not limited to certain personnel services, payroll processing, administration services and benefit administration services, for the purpose of accommodating the transition of the Biopharma Business. In exchange for providing such services, we agreed to pay or reimburse, as applicable, the costs related thereto, including salaries and benefits for certain of CGI’s Biopharma Business employees during the transition period. The transition service period varies with respect to each service provided in the agreement, and is subject to extension through a later date as mutually agreed upon by both parties. In connection with the acquisition, we added laboratory facilities in Rutherford, New Jersey and Raleigh, North Carolina and, as of January 1, 2020, we added 77 additional employees in connection with the acquisition.

Series A and A-1 Investment by Ampersand
 
On July 15, 2019, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Ampersand pursuant to which we sold to Ampersand, in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, up to an aggregate of $27,000,000 of Series A and Series A-1 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, both at an issuance price per share of $100,000. The initial closing, which was consummated promptly after the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement on July 15, 2019 (the “Initial Closing”), involved the issuance of 60 newly created shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $6,000,000, and 80 newly created shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $8,000,000. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplated a second closing (the “Second Closing”), which was effected following the fulfillment of certain conditions, including, among others, the approval by the stockholders of the Company (the “Stockholder Approval”), as required under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Nasdaq Listing Rules”), of the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of such Preferred Stock in excess of the aggregate number of shares of common stock that the Company could issue upon conversion of such Preferred Stock without breaching its obligations under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The terms of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock provided that each share of such preferred stock would automatically convert into one share of Series A Preferred Stock upon the Company obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Furthermore, as a required condition of the Initial Closing, Ampersand designated and the Board appointed and elected a Class I Director.
 
On October 10, 2019, we obtained Stockholder Approval and each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Ampersand at the Initial Closing automatically converted into one share of Series A Preferred Stock. On October 16, 2019, the Company and Ampersand consummated the Second Closing, where the Company issued to Ampersand 130 newly created shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate gross purchase price of $13,000,000. The Company used the proceeds from the Second Closing (i) to make the maturity date payment, subject to certain holdbacks, with respect to the Excess Consideration Note issued by a subsidiary of the Company to CGI, and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including the integration of pharma services. On October 17, 2019, after the Second Closing, Eric Lev was re-appointed to our Board as a Class I director by Ampersand, as the holder of 270 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, representing all of the shares of Series A outstanding after the Second Closing. Furthermore, as the holder of 270 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Ampersand became entitled to elect a second and third director to our Board. On October 17, 2019, Ampersand designated and the Board appointed two Class II directors. In connection with the Second Closing, a cash payment of $6,024,489 was made to CGI under the Excess Consideration Note, net of setoffs and holdbacks. As of April 21, 2020, the Company is obligated to pay CGI an additional $735,000 for funds withheld from the Excess Consideration Note to satisfy certain adjustments and indemnification obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
Series B Investment by 1315 Capital and Ampersand
 
On January 10, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement (the “Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement”) with 1315 Capital II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“1315 Capital”), and Ampersand (together with 1315 Capital, the “Investors”) pursuant to which we sold to the Investors, in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, an aggregate of $20,000,000 in Series B Preferred Stock, at an issuance price per share of $1,000. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement, 1315 Capital purchased 19,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $19,000,000 and Ampersand purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000.
 
In addition, we exchanged $27,000,000 of the Company’s existing Series A Preferred Stock held by Ampersand, represented by 270 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which represented all of the Company’s issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, for 27,000 newly created shares of Series B Preferred Stock (such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the “Exchange Shares” and such transaction, the “Exchange”). Following the Exchange, no shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain designated, authorized, issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement, Ampersand also agreed to waive all dividends and weighted-average anti-dilution adjustments accrued to date on the Series A Preferred Stock. Ampersand’s director designation rights as holder of Series A Preferred Stock were also replaced following the Exchange with the following Series B Preferred Stock director designation rights.
 
For so long as each of Ampersand and 1315 Capital holds at least sixty percent (60%) of the Series B Preferred Stock issued to it on January 15, 2020, such Investor will be entitled to elect two directors to the Board, provided that one of the directors qualifies as an “independent director” under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the listing rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor rule or similar rule promulgated by another exchange on which the Company’s securities are then listed or designated) (“Independent Director”). However, if at any time such Investor holds less than sixty percent (60%), but at least forty percent (40%), of the Series B Preferred Stock issued to them on January 15, 2020, such Investor would only be entitled to elect one director to the Board. Any director elected pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation may be removed without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock. A vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may be filled only by vote or written consent in lieu of a meeting of such holders of Series B Preferred Stock or by any remaining director or directors elected by such holders of Series B Preferred Stock.

Consistent with the director designation rights described above, the Board appointed and elected (a) one (1) Class I Director, as designated by Ampersand; and (b) three (3) Class II Directors, one of whom was designated by Ampersand and two by 1315 Capital. In connection with such appointments and elections as directors, two former directors resigned as directors and from all applicable committees of the Board. Moreover, under the terms of the Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of the Company’s stockholders at the 2020 annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders (the “2020 Annual Meeting”) of an amendment to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended, to eliminate the classified structure of the Board and to provide that all members of the Board stand for election at each annual meeting. Each Investor also agreed to vote in favor of the election of existing directors Jack Stover, Dr. Joseph Keegan and Stephen J. Sullivan to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting.
 
The Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”) provides that each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the holder into a number of shares of our common stock equal to dividing the amount equal to the greater of the stated value of $1,000 of such Series B Preferred Stock, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into our common stock immediately prior to a liquidation, by sixty cents ($0.60) (as adjusted to $6.00 following effectuation of the Reverse Stock Split in January 2020 and subject to further adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares). The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued through conversion of the currently outstanding Series B Preferred Stock is 78,333,334 shares (as adjusted to 7,833,334 shares following effectuation of the Reverse Stock Split and subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares). On any matter presented to our stockholders for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of our common stock into which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or by the Certificate of Designation, holders of Series B Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class and on an as-converted to common stock basis.
 
The Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holders thereof to certain protective provisions. In particular, for so long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the written consent of the holders of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) is required for us to amend, waive, alter or repeal the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Designation in a manner adverse to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, authorize, create or issue any equity securities senior to or pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock, or increase or decrease the number of directors constituting the Board. Moreover, for so long as thirty percent (30%) of the Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of January 15, 2020 remains outstanding (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares, including the Reverse Stock Split effected in January 2020), the written consent of the holders representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) is required for us to: (A) authorize, create or issue any debt securities for borrowed money or funded debt (1) pursuant to which we issue shares, warrants or any other convertible security, or (2) in excess of $4,500,000.00 initially, with such amount to be increased in connection with an aggregate consolidated revenue milestone, but excluding certain specified permitted transactions; (B) merge with or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of one or more other companies or entities with a value in excess of $20,000,000.00, to be increased in connection with an aggregate consolidated revenue milestone; (C) materially change our business; (D) consummate any Liquidation (as defined in the Certificate of Designation); (E) transfer material intellectual property rights other than in the ordinary course of business; (F) declare or pay any cash dividend or make any cash distribution on any of our equity interests other than the Series B Preferred Stock; (G) repurchase or redeem any shares of our capital stock, except for the redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation, or repurchases of our common stock under agreements previously approved by the Board with employees, consultants, advisors or others who performed services for us in connection with the cessation of such employment or service; (H) incur any additional individual debt, indebtedness for borrowed money or other additional liabilities pursuant to we issue shares, warrants or any other convertible security, or incur any individual debt, indebtedness for borrowed money or other liabilities pursuant to which we do not issue shares, warrants or any other convertible security exceeding, in each case, $4,500,000.00 initially, with such amount to be increased in connection with an aggregate consolidated revenue milestone, but excluding certain specified permitted transactions; (I) change any of our accounting methods, except for those changes required by GAAP or applicable regulatory agencies or authorities; or (J) conduct a public offering of common stock registered with the SEC, including any at-the-market offering of our common stock.
 
 During April 2020, the Company applied for various federal stimulus loans, grants and advances made available under Title 1 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including a loan request under the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In connection with the Company’s application for the PPP loan, both Ampersand and 1315 Capital consented to, and agreed to vote their shares of Series B Preferred Stock in favor of any “Fundamental Action” taken by the Company as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. “Fundamental Actions” include the Company’s ability to a) authorize, create or issue any debt securities for borrowed money or funded debt; b) merge with or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of one or more other companies or entities with a value in excess of $20 million; c) transfer, by sale, exclusive license or otherwise, material intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, other than those accomplished in the ordinary course of business; d) declare or pay any cash dividend or make any cash distribution on any equity interests of the Company other than the Series B Shares; d) incur any additional individual debt, indebtedness for borrowed money or other additional liabilities; and e) change any accounting methods or practices of the Company, except for those changes required by GAAP or applicable regulatory agencies or authorities.

Reverse Stock Split
 
At a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on December 13, 2019, our stockholders authorized our Board, in its discretion, to amend our certificate of incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio between one-for-five (1:5) and one-for-fifteen (1:15), with such final ratio to be determined by the Board following the special meeting (the “Reverse Stock Split”). On January 14, 2020, the Board determined to set the Reverse Stock Split ratio at one-for-ten (1:10) and approved the final form of the certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 14, 2020. The Reverse Stock Split became effective in accordance with the terms of the certificate of amendment at 12:01a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, January 15, 2020, at which time every ten (10) shares of common stock issued and outstanding automatically combined into one (1) share of issued and outstanding common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Fractional shares were not issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any fractional shares of our common stock that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share.
 
The Reverse Stock Split resulted in a proportionate adjustment to the per share exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding stock options and warrants, as well as the number of shares of common stock eligible for issuance under the Interpace Biosciences, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan and the Interpace Biosciences, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
 
Except as otherwise indicated, all share and per share information herein gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
