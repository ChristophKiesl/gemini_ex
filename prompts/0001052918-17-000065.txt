General

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 8, 2007 under the name of Aspen Global Corp. On June 10, 2008, we changed our name to Diversified Mortgage Workout Corp. On June 19, 2013, Arem Pacific Corporation, an Arizona corporation (Arem Pacific-Arizona), acquired voting control of the Company (then Diversified Workout Corporation). Subsequently, on August 8, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Arem Pacific Corporation, an Arizona corporation (Arem Pacific-Arizona), from its then existing shareholders. In connection with that transaction, we retired and returned to our treasury all of the capital stock acquired by Arem Pacific-Arizona in the July 19, 2013 transaction and we also changed our name in Delaware to Arem Pacific Corp (Arem Pacific-Delaware). On July 23, 2013, we effected a 388 to 1 reverse stock split of our common stock. Arem Pacific-Arizona, our wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated on July 11, 2007. Effective April 15, 2016, our Form S-1 Registration Statement registering 13,694,711 shares of our common stock was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition, on June 30, 2012, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement with Sanyi Pty Ltd, an Australian company, Arem acquired all of the equity interest in that company. In exchange, the sole owner of Sanyi Pty Ltd, Mr. Xin Jin, received 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares were issued on August 30, 2013.

Our principal office address is 47 Mount Pleasant Road, Nunawading, Victoria, Australia 3131 and our telephone is (61) 424-158008.  As of March 31, 2015, we have 12 employees, including four officers who work part-time for the company. Currently, we do not have a web-site. 

Our Business

During 2015, we operated two wellness centers in Victoria State, Australia. One of the centers was located in Chirnside Park Shopping Centre, Chirnside Park (a suburb of Victoria), Australia VIC 3116, and the second is located in Point Cook Shopping Centre, 2 Main St, Point Cook, Victoria, Australia VIC 3030. On April 1, 2016, we closed our location at Chirnside Park, and we are now operating the one location.

The Point Cook location consists of approximately 88 square meters and its layout is depicted below:

The Point Cook location has 1 full time supervisor and 5 full time masseurs. The size of future locations are expected to range between 50 to 100 square meters.

Services Provided at Centers.
 The Company provides the following services at its centers:

·
 Acupressure/Reflexology,
 ·
 Neck, shoulder, back, legs and full body massages, 
 ·
 Foot massages,
 ·
 Cupping, and 
 ·
 Deep Tissue and hot oil massage. 

Acupressure/Reflexology  is considered acupuncture without needles. Similar to acupuncture, strategic body meridians are targeted by the practitioner using pressure from their fingers, elbows or special devices. Acupressure also is component of traditional Chinese medicine. Reflexology is similar to acupressure and targets specific points on the feet and hands which correspond to organs in the body. 
Massage Therapy  involves the application of soft tissue manipulation techniques to the body designed to reduce muscle tension and increase circulation. There are many variations of massage therapy, including Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others. It is believed that massage therapy was practiced in many ancient civilizations, including China, India and Greece.
Cupping  involves the warming of glass cups through a flammable substance which eliminates oxygen, thus creating a vacuum. The cup is then placed over a specific area. The lack of oxygen anchors the cup and the suction draws the skin which simulates blood flow to the area. This process is considered the inverse of massage. Cupping is one of the oldest forms of Chinese medicine. 

The services are provided by skilled practitioners trained in massage therapy, acupressure and cupping. Sessions vary from 15 to 90 minutes and prices vary according to the nature of services and length of session. Our price list is set forth below:

Our Revenue Model
 We generate revenues from the following methods:

- Fees for Services  we charge fees to our customers dependent on the treatment administered and length of treatment. Computed on an hourly basis, these fees range from $50 to $80 per hour. 

Revenues derived from an average customer approximate $34 per visit. At our locations, each masseur averages 5 customers/day (8 hours of operation) or 30 customers/week (6 working days) or 1,500 customers/year (50 weeks). An average of 5 masseurs/location yields approximate sales revenue of $250,000 to $275,000 annualized. Although our average has been 5 customers a day, we believe that each masseur is capable of serving up to 10 customers per day.

Our Masseurs
 Each of our locations is staffed with between 5 to 6 masseurs and one supervisor. The supervisor is our most experienced masseur at the location. The supervisor oversees the day to day operations of the center and may serve customers during personnel shortages. Our masseurs are employees and are paid a yearly salary of approximately $49,000 depending on experience. In addition, we are required by law to pay our full and part time employees health insurance which is roughly less than 1% of salary. From time to time, we use independent contractors during personnel shortages and they are paid a portion of the customer fee ranging between 45-55%.

There are no license requirements for masseurs in Australia. Many of our masseurs have received a Certificate IV in Massage Therapy Practice by Melbourne College of Professional Therapists. The remainder of our masseurs has been trained internally by our location supervisor. These trainees undergo a 6 month training program with our supervisor. In addition, we require each masseur to have a first aid certificate, a certificate of insurance, and 2 written character references from the staff of a college or from a member of the Australian Association of Massage Therapists.

Marketing
 To date our marketing and promotional activities have been limited. In the past, we have principally relied upon traffic at our mall locations to generate customers. To a lesser extent, periodically we distributed promotional materials to neighborhoods surrounding our two locations. As stated in our Growth Strategy below, we intend increase our marketing and promotional efforts in an effort to drive more traffic to our locations.
Our Growth Strategy 
 Our growth and expansion strategy for the next 6-12 months will include allocating more capital resources to marketing and promotion of our centers. In addition, we may attempt to acquire additional locations in the Victoria area. 

Increase our marketing and promotional efforts. We plan to allocate more capital resources to the marketing and promotion of our existing centers. Beginning in the third calendar quarter of 2015, we plan expend approximately $1,500 per location each quarter in advertising and promotion in an effort to drive more traffic to our locations. 

Our new marketing initiatives will attempt to take advantage of our location in busy shopping malls and will include the following; 

·
 During holidays and select weekends throughout the year, we intend to set up displays outside our centers with employees offering various promotions (such as offering free 10 minute massages and providing a refreshing herbal drink or snack to shoppers in the mall).
 ·
 Commencing in third calendar quarter of 2015, we will begin offering 10 minute free massages to senior citizens and to members of social clubs and gyms in connection with various events sponsored by the community. In addition, during that period, we will initiate a referral program offering a 10% discount to existing customer that brings in new clients.

We also intend to improve our communications to our customer base by offering regular email promotions designed to encourage old customers to use our services. 

Acquire additional locations. We will seek to acquire additional operating massage locations in Victoria. In order to accomplish this objective, we plan on using a combination of bank debt (or owner financing) and our capital stock to acquire these outlets. Presently, we have not identified any locations for acquisition, nor have we made any arrangements with any bank for acquisition financing. We can not predict if we will be successful in acquiring any additional locations on terms which we might find acceptable or on any terms.

Seasonality
 There is no discernible seasonality in our business, although as a percentage of total annual net revenue, we expect the first calendar year quarter is typically the lowest.  Revenue and operating income will vary by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter.    In addition, the volatility in the local economy will impact our quarterly revenue and operating income.
Regulatory Matters
 We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulations. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we plan to conduct our wellness operation and sell advertising, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
Competition
 We plan to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence and the competitors introduction of low-priced services.

Employees
 As of June 30, 2016, we had 1 full time employee and 11 part time employees, including our chairman and chief executive officer. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

Currently, we have not entered into an employment agreement with any of our officers nor the Chief Executive Officer of Sanyi. The Company presently does not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, the Company may adopt plans in the future.   Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time.  

Properties 
 Our corporate offices are located at 47 Mount Pleasant Road, Nunawading, Victoria, Australia at a space owned by Mr. Xin Jin, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Sanyi and our Director. We occupy the space on a month to month basis, rent free. The office space consists of approximately 50 square meters. 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company has one company owned center. Relevant information with respect to this location is as follows: 


Location | Size of Premises (Sq. Meters) | Lease Term | Commencement Date | Annual Rent
Point Cook Outlet | 88 | 6 years Renewable for an additional 5 years | 8/28/2008 | $67,000 

Equipment and Equipment Suppliers

The Companys equipment needs are minimal consisting of massage benches and various office equipment and computers. The Company purchases its equipment from local suppliers on an as needed basis and presently does not believe the loss of any one supplier will have an adverse effect on its business.

We are an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
