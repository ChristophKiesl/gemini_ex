Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 
We are a commercial stage RNA platform-based life sciences company focused on advancing the promise of precision medicine. Our proprietary NGS-adapted chemistry and HTG EdgeSeq platform automate sample processing and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile hundreds or thousands of molecular targets using a relatively small amount of biological sample, in liquid or solid forms. Our products include instruments, consumables and software that combine to form our HTG EdgeSeq platform. Our menu of HTG EdgeSeq molecular profiling panels is automated on our HTG EdgeSeq platform, applying genomic sequencing tools to quickly generate gene expression data using our simplified workflow for customers. 
 Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, companion diagnostic development and molecular diagnostics, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe that our target customers desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples, with the ability to test and analyze such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost.
 We seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling for biomarker analysis and diagnostics, including the acceleration of precision medicine, the migration of molecular testing to NGS-based applications, the movement to smaller and less invasive biopsies, the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity, the need to conform to challenging healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow, including simplified bioinformatics. Our capabilities enable customers to extend the use of limited biological samples for retrospective analysis, gaining further understanding of the molecular drivers of disease with the goal of developing biomarker-driven targeted therapies. 
 Our HTG EdgeSeq technology solution is currently being used in two complementary ways to advance precision medicine. Biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and other translational research centers purchase our HTG EdgeSeq technology to discover and validate biomarkers and develop molecular subtypes which can identify patient populations most likely to respond to certain therapies. Our HTG EdgeSeq platform, assays and software facilitate customer analysis of gene expression profiles from a wide variety of sample types to accelerate discovery, support translational applications and evaluate target biomarkers for companion diagnostics. Our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software is a complementary technology that supports our customers in interrogating and visualizing HTG EdgeSeq data, and gaining insights into complex biology using gene signatures that enable a greater understanding of the disease heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. 
 In addition to purchasing our technology for use in their facilities, customers can also obtain the advantages of our technology by contracting with one of our certified service providers or Preferred Academic Centers of Excellence (“PACE”) partners, or through our Tucson, Arizona-based VERI/O laboratory for sample processing and custom assay development service offerings. Our PACE program has established a network of small and large academic centers committed to expanding the utility of our technology in distinct areas of cancer, neurodegenerative and auto-immune disease research. PACE partners support this effort by establishing a consortium of users, generating useful data demonstrating the utility of our technology and conducting technology workshops to raise awareness of our technology and its applications. 
 Pre-clinical services, including custom assay design and sample processing services provided by our VERI/O laboratory employees, allow our customers to identify and validate biomarker signatures across their drug portfolios or patient cohorts more efficiently. Our VERI/O laboratory is a high-volume molecular laboratory focused solely on providing high-quality data from our proprietary molecular profiling technology. These services provide our customers expedited access to our technology at a competitive price. For our biopharmaceutical company customers, we offer an end-to-end solution leveraging a single technology from discovery to diagnostics. Through collaboration with biopharmaceutical company customers, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive services to design, develop and manufacture custom targeted assays with complex molecular diagnostic signatures as investigational use only (“IUO”) assays for use in global prospective or retrospective clinical trials. Our expertise in medical device design control and global regulatory submissions, coupled with our ISO 13485:2016 certified quality system, enable us to support potential companion diagnostic (“CDx”) programs. Although our initial focus primarily has been in oncology, we offer customers a full solution from biomarker discovery to deployment of CDx assays across numerous disease states. Utilizing NGS as our method of detection provides our customers with the benefits of our highly multiplexed and extraction-free chemistry and the sensitivity and dynamic range of the sequencers, providing a powerful value proposition and complete workflow. 
 Our product and service offerings currently result in recognition of two primary sources of revenue: 
  
• | product and product-related services revenue from the sale of research use only (“RUO”) and profiling products with a CE Marking as defined by the Requirements of European Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (“CE/IVD”), sample processing services and custom assay design services; and

• | revenue from collaborative development services for companion diagnostic development programs for biopharmaceutical companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe RNA-based applications represent a large and growing market with significant, unmet needs where our HTG EdgeSeq platform has allowed us to demonstrate competitive advantages. We further believe that our platform technology can enable gene expression profiling growth to accelerate as we make NGS-based gene expression analysis easier and more sample sparing.
 
We have experienced a significant slowing of product and product-related services revenue since March 2020, and we believe this period of reduced revenue will continue through at least the first half of 2021 due to continued disruptions to our customers’ businesses from the pandemic and, in many instances, their prioritization of projects in areas focus related to COVID-19. We have also experienced limited delays in our development efforts as a result of stay-at-home orders and our efforts to prioritize the safety of our employees during this pandemic. However, all of our 2020 key development milestones were met and high priority development efforts continued, including extensive experiment study planning and analysis, despite the numerous operational challenges we have faced. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our productivity, supply chains, distribution networks and other areas of our operation as the pandemic continues to disrupt our business and the businesses of our vendors, partners and customers.
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in gene expression for molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe HTG EdgeSeq technology is a platform that we can leverage into three primary revenue verticals: RUO profiling, molecular diagnostics and companion diagnostic collaborations. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Expand our position in translational medicine with our RUO molecular profiling products. We believe the market for gene expression analysis for translational medicine is large and growing quickly. We have built targeted panels in oncology, immuno-oncology, immune response and micro-RNA that enable scientists to look at gene expression patterns to identify molecular subtypes, study key pathways and to discover and validate biomarker hypotheses to help drive precision medicine. In 2020, we expanded the utility of these panels by adding new applications to interrogate the tumor micro-environment such as tumor inflammation and immunophenotyping signatures in our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software. Next, we expect to continue development of our transcriptome product, which is expected to measure approximately 20,000 RNA targets, covering the entire human transcriptome, with commercial launch of an RUO product currently expected for the third quarter of 2021. We expect this product to enable gene expression analysis of the transcriptome from significantly less sample input and from lower quality samples. We further expect this product to expand our product offerings outside of oncology and autoimmune and into markets such as transplant and diabetes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partner with other diagnostic developers to develop, or develop independently, molecular diagnostic panels with high medical utility. Our HTG EdgeSeq platform technology was developed with features that we believe solve many of the challenges facing NGS-based assays and workflows. We plan to leverage our core HTG EdgeSeq technology to partner with other test developers and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified labs to develop molecular diagnostic tests or to enable laboratory developed test (“LDT”) development. We further expect the transcriptome product to be an additional platform on which we will partner with these customers and build proprietary HTG diagnostic panels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Re-establish companion diagnostics collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. We believe collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs have the potential to lead to us generating companion diagnostic consumables revenue. As of December 31, 2020, our technology and products were used in 50 active development programs across leading biopharmaceutical companies which are incorporating biomarkers and potentially companion diagnostics in their drug development programs. We plan to develop novel RNA-based gene classifiers to help biopharmaceutical companies and leading translational medicine researchers better understand and predict durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drug candidates, such as anti-PD-L1 therapeutics, in mono and combination therapies. We also plan to develop novel RNA profiling tests that can provide important biomarker information in emerging areas of immuno-oncology, autoimmune and other disease areas. In addition, once available, we expect to develop and market a clinical grade transcriptome product as a new universal CDx platform for gene expression profiling to biopharma customers. In 2020, we signed a new 10-year non-exclusive agreement with QIAGEN Manchester Limited (“QML”) to leverage its global commercial expertise and global distribution reach specifically for CDx assays. We believe this further strengthens our ability to partner with biopharma customers for potential CDx opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Establish our systems workflow as the best solution for RNA clinical sequencing. We intend to continue to establish our technology as the best complementary workflow with next-generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption by leveraging the large and growing installed base of next-generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners, including Illumina, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the addressable market of our technology through new applications and expansion into new disease states and liquid biopsies. In 2020, we released several new applications focused on oncology to interrogate the tumor micro-environment, such as tumor inflammation and immunophenotyping signatures available in our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software. We expect continued development of these new applications will allow us to reach new customers focused on additional disease areas and markets. Customers are now using our platform technology in autoimmune disorders, infectious disease and diabetes. We have also shown feasibility of being able to measure RNA in exosomes, which we believe positions us to expand into liquid biopsy applications. We continue to assess and broaden the utility of our platform technology, and strategically seek partners and collaborators who may be interested in additional areas outside of our core focus area of oncology.

Our Market Opportunities
 Cancer Molecular Profiling and Genomics in Life Science Research
 Molecular profiling is the analysis of biomarkers, including DNA, RNA and protein, in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify gene expression patterns or genomic changes. The HTG EdgeSeq technology coupled with NGS is making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of potentially tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. 
 Among what we believe are the most promising applications of molecular profiling is the targeted sequencing of RNA from patient samples to identify gene expression patterns or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. These applications have launched a fundamental shift towards personalized medicine where an individual patient’s molecular profile is used to guide treatment. 
 The supplier market for RNASeq is estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion and growing annually at 10-20%. The gene expression component of that market is estimated to be approximately $820.0 million and growing at the same rate. With these metrics in mind, we expect our target market, NGS-based gene expression profiling, to be between $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion by 2024. 
 Therapy Driven Diagnostics - Companion Diagnostics
 The World Health Organization estimates that cancer will lead to the death of 11.5 million people by 2030. As a result, biopharmaceutical companies are aggressively deploying biomarker driven strategies to improve the response rates to existing and new drugs in development as well as combination therapies. These companies are looking for technology solutions that can more effectively identify the biological root causes of disease and aid the discovery of biomarkers to better develop and target drugs to the right patients. The companion diagnostic market is currently estimated at $2.6 billion and growing approximately 20% annually. We believe that the acceleration of investment into immunotherapy drugs will also be a catalyst for future companion diagnostics for combination therapies where RNA gene expression classification is expected to be important.
 When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. In the United States, upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval or clearance of the CDx test, the patient must be tested with the CDx test prior to being treated with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility which generally supports favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe there are currently approximately 3,100 oncology clinical trials, approximately 24% of which are interrogating RNA. This percentage has more than doubled since 2014, and we believe this percentage will approach 50% by 2025.

Molecular Diagnostics – NGS-based Workflows
 Complexities and Challenges of Molecular Diagnostics Today
 Currently, molecular profiling is typically conducted in the clinical setting using a variety of profiling techniques and instrumentation platforms across multiple laboratory departments, and, in many situations, sent to distant labs. These techniques include immunohistochemistry (“IHC”), fluorescent in situ hybridization (“FISH”), polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”), gene expression arrays (“GEA”) and NGS. This distributed profiling approach has accelerated the use of molecular profiling and increased the need to make the process more accessible and routine. However, molecular profiling is also highly specialized because many current technologies are complex, require multiple capital-intensive workflows and are not economically scalable to the case volume of the local laboratory. The fragmentation of methods, smaller sample sizes, sample logistics and information flow has created significant challenges for labs, physicians and patients.
Our Solution
 At the core of our solution is our proprietary chemistry known as quantitative nuclease protection (“qNPA”). Our qNPA-based chemistry provides a sensitive and efficient method for analyzing RNA as it eliminates the need for nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, complicated bioinformatics steps and other complex processes. We designed and developed our automation platform and software analysis tools to optimize the capabilities of our chemistry, provide fast turnaround time and enable ease of use to molecular labs. Our chemistry and automation platform are highly adaptable, so when molecular profiling needs change or emerge, we expect to be able to efficiently add new applications to address these needs.
 Our products and services are designed to work with many different biological sample types, can generate robust results from very small samples, and obviate the need for many of the sample-preparation steps associated with traditional molecular techniques. Our platform and assays enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable, now or in the future, of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression levels, RNA-expressed gene fusions and insertions in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.
 We believe we are well positioned with the following key product benefits:
  
• | Optimize sample utilization. Our platform can analyze several thousand genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five-micron section of tissue or 15 microliters of plasma or serum. With the launch of our transcriptome panel, the analysis plex increases 10 times, while maintaining minimal sample input requirements. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical or pre-clinical laboratories where today there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing desired. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample volumes will be a significant driver of adoption of our technology and systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with multiple sample types. Our proprietary technology allows customers to profile and unlock molecular information from a wide variety of biological samples such as formalin fixed paraffin embedded (“FFPE”) tissue, cells, whole blood, serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile these and other sample types and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our technology will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use in multiple applications. We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure a variety of molecular targets in many necessary applications, including RNA expression levels and expressed RNA gene rearrangements (such as gene fusions and insertions), and offers the ability to quantify these applications on a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of our technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is comparatively simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-quantitative PCR (“RT-qPCR”), our chemistry does not require cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and opportunities for technician error.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust data. Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and the same answer can be produced under many different conditions. Our chemistry is highly specific and sensitive, meaning it can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our system produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use. Our technology is designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex sample-preparation processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, labeling, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq platform further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the data bioinformatics, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified bioinformatics. Our HTG EdgeSeq Reveal software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface that is flexible enough for researchers yet structured enough for clinical laboratories. The HTG EdgeSeq parser software, which processes the data generated from the NGS platform, is modular so that new applications can be downloaded without any changes to hardware. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Advantages

 Current Commercial Panels Offered on the HTG EdgeSeq Platform
 We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting early and late-stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies, such as immuno-oncology. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas, which, we also believe, will facilitate our commercialization of diagnostic tests, including tumor classifiers and prognostic tests. 
 
Our currently marketed panels are:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel.

• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay. DLBCL tumors are frequently classified into either ABC or GCB subtypes by measuring the molecular profile of the tumor. These two subtypes display different clinical pathologies, as patients with the GCB subtype of DLBCL tend to respond differently than those of the ABC subtype. With many of the large number of new DLBCL-targeting drugs appearing to have greater efficacy in one of the subtypes, a need for a reliable, FFPE-based cell of origin classification assay has emerged. This product is labeled RUO and is available as an IUO for use in late-stage drug programs to stratify patients.

Our Technology
 HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
 Our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry is shown schematically in the figure below. Specifically, DNA nuclease protection probes, or DNA protection probes, which include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences are hybridized to targeted RNAs. Target RNA can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen probes are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove single-stranded nucleic acids, including unhybridized DNA protection probes and RNA. Following S1 nuclease treatment, the only remaining DNA protection probes in the reaction are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen probes to form a hybridized complex. This produces an approximately 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the hybridized complexes releases the DNA protection probes from such complexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and tags in a thermocycler. The labeled DNA protection probes are concentrated, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the parser software provided with the HTG EdgeSeq platform.
 
Key Advantages of our HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
  
• | Multiplexing tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of reaction components. While we are currently marketing a panel with our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that can profile up to 2,560 genes in a sample, we have demonstrated feasibility on our technology working with panels as large as 22,000 genes. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA generally require RNA that is isolated and purified from other components found in the sample. These time-consuming steps may lead to some target loss and bias the test outcome. In FFPE tissues, for example, it has been reported that a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes molecular profiling of small FFPE tissues particularly challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA recovery. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be magnified throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for FFPE samples or most other sample types (we recommend extracting RNA from fresh-frozen tissue samples to prevent processing variability) and improves utilization of precious samples, thereby improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to bias the data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently RT-qPCR and traditional RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into DNA for analysis. This process, called reverse transcription, requires an enzyme to move along the extracted RNA to create a DNA copy of the molecule. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into DNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, removing a technical difficulty experienced with competitive technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of heat, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, we believe our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in amplification of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.

HTG Instrument Platform
 Our instrument and assays were developed internally and are manufactured in Tucson, AZ under ISO 13485:2016 certified procedures using our proprietary HTG EdgeSeq chemistry to simplify multiplexed nucleic acid testing in research and clinical laboratories. The entire workflow from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in as few as 36 hours for 96 samples. With the speed, flexibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of our HTG EdgeSeq platform, combined with the system’s ability to work effectively with small sample volumes, researchers can profile tens, hundreds or thousands of different genes per sample.
 

The HTG EdgeSeq platform consists of a processor (shown above), a host computer and integrated software. The processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. The instrument has barcode scanner units to process the two-dimensional barcodes printed on the consumables loaded into the instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use in order to reduce operator errors and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic liquid handling within the instrument is engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of the robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples. One host computer supports up to six processors allowing laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors.
 Applications of our HTG EdgeSeq technology combine the HTG EdgeSeq platform with a NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of tens, hundreds or thousands of targeted RNAs in a single panel. The sample is prepared for quantitation on the processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are concentrated, pooled, and sequenced on a NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the parser software included with the system. HTG EdgeSeq assays currently are available to process from one to 96 samples in a single batch. 
 In addition to direct sales of our systems, we utilize several alternative arrangements to provide customer access to our platform. Our platform can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase HTG EdgeSeq assays and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances, we provide our instruments free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation prior to acquisition. We also may choose to install instruments for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase assays and other consumables from us at a stated price and volume over the term of the agreement or allow customers to rent our instrument for a monthly fee. As of December 31, 2020, we had an installed base of 68 instruments (consisting of 51 systems sold, five covered under reagent rental or standard rental agreements, five evaluation units and seven systems with key opinion leaders).

Opportunities for Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Diagnostics
 We are currently developing what we believe will be a cornerstone transcriptome product for use in both RUO molecular profiling and as a platform technology for clinical and companion diagnostics. We are initially focused on partnering with other content providers who want an improved RNA GEP platform technology for their tests. We expect to partner with CLIA certified laboratories in the U.S. and major medical centers in Europe. We also expect to position the transcriptome product as a universal RNA GEP platform for biopharmaceutical company customer biomarker validation and CDx development. 
 We are leveraging our platform to develop comprehensive molecular profiling panels across an increasing set of molecular applications, with initial focus in immuno-oncology and the identification of pathologies through molecular profiling (“next-generation pathology”). In conjunction with our biopharmaceutical collaborators, we plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels and possibly classifiers that can provide information about inflammation signatures and the molecular immunophenotyping of tumors. Separately, we also plan to develop novel RNA-based gene panels designed for expanded applications in immune health monitoring and prescreening, detection of hyper-progression and predicting patient response to combination therapies. We believe that we will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq platform. We expect this to require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which all together represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels.
 Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2020, our research and development team consisted of 29 employees across the disciplines of research and development scientist, platform development and bioinformatics. 
 Our development efforts are primarily focused on the continued development and release of our planned transcriptome panel, which includes multiple advancements in our proprietary chemistry and associated workflow. Our development team is also responsible for clinical assay development services being performed for biopharmaceutical company customers. We believe these programs have the potential to generate future revenue through the sale of HTG EdgeSeq instruments and test kit annuities associated with a successfully approved companion diagnostic test as the related drug gains adoption. Our research efforts are currently focused on the expansion of our technology into new immune-oncology applications as well as other applications in solid and liquid biopsies, while working to continuously improve assay performance and probe design.
 Sales and Marketing
 We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the United States and Europe and through distributors in parts of Europe and other countries. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of 16 employees including seven in direct sales or sales management, four in sales support and five in marketing. In addition to our U.S. sales team, as of December 31, 2020, we had eight direct sales and support employees in Europe and distribution agreements in several additional countries. This sales model provides us with direct sales coverage in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, with distributors in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kosovo, Leetonia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
 Our sales and marketing efforts target biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq platform, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays upon marketing clearance or approval by the FDA, by expanding our U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and to influence utilization of our products.
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We primarily manufacture our products within our facility in Tucson, AZ. External resources are leveraged for their specific expertise in either producing components for our HTG EdgeSeq instrument and raw materials for our consumables in accordance with our designs or based on their catalog products which are utilized as is within our designs. We manufacture HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2016 standards. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next several years.
 11


We require a wide variety of raw materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies to manufacture our products. While multiple commercial sources provide the majority of these required components and supplies, we currently rely on a single supplier to manufacture a subcomponent used in our HTG EdgeSeq instrument. As part of our standard supply management process, we continuously monitor material availability, vendor status and supply chain disruptions to identify and mitigate potential risks by expanding material and source alternatives. In addition, to manage potential risks arising from use of the single source subcomponent supplier, we believe that, if necessary, we could identify and qualify a second supplier for this part. In addition, while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we closely monitor inventory of this subcomponent and purchase incremental inventory in this area as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain. If the capabilities of our suppliers and subcomponent manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disasters, quality, regulatory or other reasons, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products. 
 Instruments
 We assemble and test our HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Instrument component vendors are qualified under our quality system and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time. 
Consumables
 We manufacture and test our HTG EdgeSeq consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Raw material vendors are selected using precise standards and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase raw material stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand. We produce batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a minimum/maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand.

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and maintain intellectual property rights relating to key aspects of the technology employed in our HTG EdgeSeq platform and assays, maintain any strategic licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely upon certain patents, registered and common law trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, invention and patent assignment agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to aggressively protect, defend and extend the intellectual property rights in our technology.
Patents and Patent Applications
 As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio included 12 patent families that, collectively, consisted of six issued U.S. patents, 51 granted foreign patents (variously in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom), and 16 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions (including one allowed in Canada). This portfolio is directed to our nuclease-protection-based technologies, other nucleic-acid detection methods, and to methods for DLBCL and distinguishing indeterminate nevi from melanoma. Our patent portfolio will help us maintain an exclusive position in key areas of our business, including targeted nuclease-protection based sequencing, and DLBCL COO applications of our technology. In addition, this portfolio may provide out‑licensing opportunities, such as, for methods of detecting melanoma or detection of single-nucleotide changes. There were 10 granted patents, including one U.S. patent, directed to our novel HTG EdgeSeq methods in the portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The HTG EdgeSeq method patents will expire in April 2032. Our portfolio also included 16 applications as of December 31, 2020, including six for our direct-target sequencing (V2) HTG EdgeSeq methods, six for our DLBCL subtyping methods, and a patent cooperation treaty application directed to detecting DNA and RNA in the same sample. 
Trade Secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that we have entered into such agreements with all relevant parties, or that these parties will abide by the terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy or commercially exploit aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 For additional information relating to the risks associated with our intellectual property position see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”

Agreements with Third Parties
 Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC
 We entered into an asset purchase agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014, with NuvoGen Research, LLC (“NuvoGen”) to acquire certain intellectual property from NuvoGen (“NuvoGen obligation”). The acquired technology generally relates to our former array-based nuclease protection panels. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the acquired technology, we agreed to pay NuvoGen aggregate cash compensation of $15.0 million. On an annual basis we are currently obligated to pay the greater of $0.4 million or 6% of our annual revenue, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement totals $15.0 million. Interest on the remaining unpaid obligation has been accrued since January 1, 2019 and compounds annually at a rate of 2.5% per year. Accrued interest on this unpaid obligation is payable on the date that the remaining obligation is paid in full.
SVB Term Loan
 On June 24, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), as lender, which provides a secured term loan in the principal amount of $10.0 million (the “SVB Term Loan”). The proceeds from the SVB Term Loan were fully funded on the June 25, 2020. The proceeds from the SVB Term Loan, together with cash on hand, were used to repay in full all outstanding amounts and fees due under the Credit and Security Agreement (Term Loan) and Credit and Security Agreement (Revolving Loan) entered into with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent (the “MidCap Credit Facility”) and a subordinated convertible promissory note to QIAGEN North American Holdings, Inc. (the QNAH Convertible Note”). Our obligations under the SVB Term Loan are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). 
 
The SVB Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the greater of 2.5% above the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and 5.75%. Interest on the SVB Term Loan is due and payable monthly in arrears. The SVB Term Loan allows for interest-only payments through June 30, 2021. The interest only period may be extended for six months upon the achievement of an equity milestone as fully defined in the Loan Agreement. The ultimate interest-only period will be followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the maturity date of December 1, 2023.
 
Prepayments of the SVB Term Loan, in whole or in part, will be subject to early termination fees of up to 3% and we will be required to pay a final fee equal to 8% of the principal amount of the SVB Term Loan upon termination of the Loan Agreement. 
 
The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, if any, to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We must also comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash at an account with SVB of not less than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) an amount equal to six times the amount of our average monthly Cash Burn (as defined in the Loan Agreement) over the trailing three months.
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 Clinical laboratories acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories offer their customers a menu of testing services using our IVD test kits or their LDTs, which they may develop using consumables they purchase from us, or a combination of both. Our customers generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments. In the United States, claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) such as Novitas and Cahaba on behalf of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations (“LCDs”) issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations (“NCDs”) which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (“AMP”) and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans. We believe that establishment of reimbursement codes specific to genomic sequencing procedures such as our CDx tests currently in development is an important factor in expanding access to our products. Our success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for tests using our technology. In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, the Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets. Failure by our U.S. and ex-U.S. customers who use our tests to obtain coverage and sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes 
 14


in government and private third-party payors’ policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
 Government Regulation – Medical Device Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products in the United States for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The companion diagnostic tests under development by HTG are classified as “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA submission can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. We believe that our companion diagnostic tests under development would be eligible for the less burdensome 510(k) regulatory pathway.
 Device Classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” to either:
  
• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 15


After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 The PMA Process
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 A PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical study data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in the device studies.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
  
• | the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


• | post-approval study and post market surveillance requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 Research Use Only
 An RUO product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only”. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and most QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. In November 2013 the FDA issued a guidance document entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (the “RUO Guidance”) which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling, advertising or promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequently offer it for clinical diagnostic use as a laboratory developed test is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s position that any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinical laboratories, conflicts with RUO status.
European Union
 The European Union (“EU”) has also adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as several directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these currently effective directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (“IVDD”) which includes:

• | Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conformity Assessment. Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the IVDD for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal premarket review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vigilance. The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 26, 2017, the EU released a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (“IVDR”) which is expected to replace IVDD. Our products in the EU will have to comply with the IVDR requirements after May 26, 2022. Until that time, our CE/IVD marked products must continue to meet the requirements of IVDD for commercialization in the EU. 
 Other International
 Several other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the EU, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.
Government Regulation – Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, significant 
 17


criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. These laws include the following:
 
 
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiology assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and

For example, the EU has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. Over time we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate. In addition, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), it creates new

The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches.

Healthcare Reform
 There have been and we anticipate that there will be healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future that may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the reimbursement for healthcare products and services. For example, the ACA, which substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, remains subject to challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA, although it is unclear when a decision will be reached. It is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Employees
 Our ability to retain current talent and recruit new employees into our Company is a critical factor in our continued growth and performance improvement. We continue to initiate programs to promote our organizational culture and to identify the best possible new talent as the organization grows and new positions are made available. As of December 31, 2020, we had 83 full-time and one part-time employee, of which 18 are employed in administration, 20 in manufacturing and operations, 18 in research and development, five in regulatory and quality affairs, and 23 in direct sales and marketing. Of these employees, eight
 were located in Europe and all others were located in the United States. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining is established by law in France. We and our French employees have agreed to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
