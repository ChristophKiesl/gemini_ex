ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Separation from Dover Corporation
On February 28, 2014, Knowles Corporation ("Knowles") became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Dover Corporation ("Dover") of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Knowles to Dover’s stockholders. Knowles' common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “KN” on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on March 3, 2014.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to (i) “Knowles,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Knowles Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, after giving effect to the spin-off of Knowles from Dover Corporation, (ii) “Former Parent” refer to Dover Corporation and (iii) the “Separation” or the “Distribution” refer to our spin-off from our Former Parent. Knowles was incorporated in Delaware on June 12, 2013 for the purpose of holding certain of Former Parent’s communication technologies businesses in connection with the Separation. The address of our principal executive offices is 1151 Maplewood Drive, Itasca, Illinois 60143. Our telephone number is 630-250-5100.
Our Company
We are a market leader and global supplier of advanced micro-acoustic, audio processing and specialty component solutions, serving the mobile consumer electronics, communications, medical, military, aerospace and industrial markets. We use our leading position in micro-electro-mechanical systems ("MEMS") microphones and strong capabilities in audio processing technologies to optimize audio systems and improve the user experience in handsets, tablets, wearables and connected devices. We are also the leader in acoustics components used in hearing aids and have a strong position in high-end oscillators (timing devices) and capacitors. In 2016, we sold the MCE speaker and receiver product line and exited that market. Our focus on our customers, combined with our unique technology, proprietary manufacturing techniques, rigorous testing and global scale, enables us to deliver innovative solutions that optimize the user experience. Founded in 1946 and headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, Knowles has approximately 8,000 employees in 12 countries around the world.
Our Strategy
We are committed to growth that will be achieved through market leadership in our business segments and expansion into attractive adjacent markets. By leveraging our core high performance, miniature, low power acoustic expertise and expanding our capabilities in audio processing technologies, we intend to increase our audio content in the mobile communications and hearing health markets. We also plan to expand our offerings to serve emerging audio opportunities in wearables, connected devices and other applications that require improved voice and audio quality or that leverage voice as a user interface. We also continue to review our offerings in the oscillator and capacitor markets and may expand those offerings if we identify profitable opportunities. In addition to our focus on audio growth, we will continue to optimize our cost profile across the mobile consumer and specialty component businesses. We are focusing our investments on the segments that we believe will exhibit the greatest potential for optimal long-term returns and we remain focused on delivering high quality products and maintaining operational excellence across our business segments. Our success will be measured through revenue growth, margin expansion, market share gains, stockholder return and stakeholder satisfaction.
Our Business Segments
During 2016, we were organized into two reportable segments based on how management analyzes performance, allocates capital and makes strategic and operational decisions. These segments were determined in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280-Segment Reporting and are comprised of (i) Mobile Consumer Electronics (“MCE”) and (ii) Specialty Components (“SC”). The segments are aligned around similar product applications serving our key end markets, to enhance focus on end market growth strategies.

Market Trends
Our products are used in a variety of end markets, notably, mobile consumer devices, medical technology, aerospace and defense and telecommunications.
The markets served by MCE continue to be driven by trends in handsets, wearables and other consumer devices. Today, OEMs face challenges differentiating their products in the global marketplace while managing growing cost pressures and time-to-market expectations. In addition, consumers expect better quality voice calls, audio and video conferencing, sound capture and playback, media content consumption and gaming, as well as extended battery life. OEMs are increasingly adopting more intelligent active audio components (audio chipset) and higher performance passive acoustic components to enable devices to handle more demanding audio use cases. Trends impacting the smartphone market today include:

• | Smartphone growth from feature phone substitution. The smartphone segment within the mobile handset device market has exhibited unit growth over the past several years. There continues to be a positive mix shift to higher-performance smartphones from feature phones (i.e., non-smartphones). The average smartphone continues to drive higher audio content including more microphones than its feature phone counterpart, compounding the growth of acoustic content as mobile phone sales rise.


• | High-end consumer elasticity. Consumers are reluctant to downgrade from a high-end smartphone to a low-end smartphone in most circumstances. This is especially true as high-end smartphones will likely continue to offer significant performance advantages and new functionality compared to low-end smartphones.


• | Proliferation of premium acoustics and multiple microphone adoption. Consumers are seeking improved acoustic solutions, regardless of the country they live in or the type of device they are using. As a result, acoustic dollar content is generally expanding per device for two primary reasons. First, many of the solutions we are introducing are higher performance and command higher value. Second, a majority of OEMs are increasing the number of acoustic components per device. Over the past several years, we have seen an increase in the number of microphones used in high end smartphones. The benefits to the user are substantial, including reduced background noise, improved voice recognition, better hands-free communication and enhanced audio recording and playback capabilities. OEMs and their customers recognize the importance of these features in their next-generation products. We believe an additional opportunity exists for these trends to expand to mid-range phones and tablets, as well as emerging wearable devices. Knowles can capitalize on these market demands by leveraging our acoustics and audio processing expertise, as well as our proprietary process technologies, to deliver solutions that improve the performance of our OEM customers’ devices.


• | Smartphone OEM market share shifts are likely to remain volatile for some time. Over the past several years, Nokia, Blackberry and Samsung have lost significant market share to other United States and Asian-based OEMs who have released smartphones that have been more readily accepted due to, among other factors, perceived feature sets and price points. We expect the OEM market to continue to be dynamic over time, characterized by rapid market share shifts driven by new product introductions, price points and feature sets.

Our Specialty Components products are sold across diverse end markets. Portions of this segment face much greater exposure to capital investment cycles and government spending, both direct and indirect, as some of these end markets are largely dependent on project upgrades, expansion and government contracts. The end markets served by Specialty Components consist primarily of the following:

• | Medical and life sciences (i.e., transducers, hearing aids, capacitors). Sales are largely driven by aging demographics, healthcare spending, the rise of a middle class in emerging markets and government subsidies.


• | Aerospace and defense communications (i.e., capacitors, filters, oscillators). Aerospace and defense spending and automation (largest end market), telecom regional coverage and bandwidth expansion and growing industrial power supply requirements are a few of the end market trends driving the product sales in this sector.


• | Telecom infrastructure (i.e., capacitors, filters, oscillators). Sales are typically levered to the expansion of large telecom companies looking to increase wireless signal in new or existing territories, although these products are also sold to aerospace and defense companies (i.e., airplane radio frequencies).

Geographic Trends
We strive to maintain our manufacturing facilities in close proximity to our direct customers. In the case of MCE, we currently operate 4 facilities in Asia to serve the contract manufacturers who build OEM equipment on behalf of our end-customers. These contract manufacturers are largely based in China, Taiwan and India. Although end-user demand for consumer electronics is global and marketing activities occur globally, the majority of our manufacturing is located in Asia, primarily in China, Malaysia and the Philippines.
In the case of SC, we operate 5 facilities in Asia to serve the manufacturing sites of both hearing aid OEMs and the contract manufacturers who build OEM headsets on behalf of earphone makers. These OEM manufacturing sites are largely based in China, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. Although marketing activities and end-user demand for hearing aid and specialty consumer components is global, manufacturing is primarily located in Asia for the purposes of being close to the point of assembly. We also operate 5 facilities in North America and 2 in Europe for the manufacturing of capacitors and oscillators that support our global telecom and military customers, as well as their suppliers and contract manufacturers.
As a majority of our manufacturing and sales occur outside the United States, we generate the majority of our profits and cash outside the United States. While no significant statutory limitation exists, a repatriation of profits from foreign markets to the United States is inherently inefficient.
Competitive Landscape
Success in the electronic components industry is primarily driven by innovation and flexibility as customers compete to gain a share of the growing consumer device market. We compete across handset, wearables and other consumer platforms to deliver superior acoustic performance through customized products. Our investments in research and development enable us to capture new design wins across consumer OEMs. Our ability to balance and shift between full and semi-automation is key to our ability to optimize our operations and operating expenses. Additionally, it is important for suppliers to have flexibility and quick time-to-market to meet clients’ needs. Notably, according to industry estimates, the product cycle for mobile handsets has shortened over recent years. Key competitors include:

• | MCE - AAC Technologies, Goertek, Invensense and ST Microelectronics; and


• | SC - Sonion, Rakon, Kyocera and Epson Electronics.

In the MCE segment, our investments in research and development enable us to continually introduce new products with higher performance. Our customers are adopting these higher value microphones to improve the overall audio performance of their devices which in turn improves the end user experience. Typically our new products have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing. Once introduced, the pricing for these products trend lower, as is typical in the consumer electronics market.
For products that were introduced more than 18 months ago, we strive to offset anticipated price erosion through bill of material cost reductions, yield improvements, equipment efficiency and movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations.
In the SC segment, the end markets tend to be more stable. Within acoustics, we see limited competition but continuously invest to improve acoustic performance for our hearing health and high end headset customers. In precision devices, we see a highly fragmented set of competitors across capacitor and oscillator products for a diverse set of end markets including telecom infrastructure, military, aerospace and medical.
Customers, Sales and Distribution
We serve customers in the mobile consumer electronics, medical technology, defense/aerospace, telecommunication infrastructure and other industrial markets. Our customers include some of the largest OEMS and operators in these markets. In addition, many of our OEM customers outsource their manufacturing to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) companies. Other customers include global mobile phone and hearing aid manufacturers and many of the largest global EMS companies, particularly in China. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 17% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Apple, Inc. accounted for approximately 19% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Group accounted for approximately 16% and 15% of our total revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during these periods.

We manufacture and develop our products at facilities located throughout the world. We maintain sales and technical customer support offices and operating facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. In our Specialty Components segment, we supplement our direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors. Our global distribution center is located in Penang, Malaysia. Our worldwide sales force provides geographically specific support to our customers and specialized selling of product lines to various customer bases. For further detail and for additional disclosures regarding sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic location, see Note 18. Segment Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials, primarily metals and semi-processed or finished components. Commodity pricing for various precious metals, such as palladium and gold, fluctuates. As a result, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. Although some cost increases may be recovered through increased prices to customers, if commodity prices trend upward, we attempt to control such costs through fixed-price contracts with suppliers and various other programs.
We rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components or subassemblies that are used in our products which, in some cases, may be sole sourced from such suppliers or foundries or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. The loss of any single supplier has not had a material impact on operating profits. However, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding risks related to our business.
We have established a Green Materials Policy, pursuant to which we have established a Green Materials Standard. Our products are in compliance with the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("EU RoHS") and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") directives. This standard is based on the list of substances identified in the Joint Industry Guide-101 Standard which is endorsed by the Electronic Industry Association, the Joint Electronics Device Engineering Council and the Japan Green Procurement Survey Standardization Initiative associations as well as the Sony Standard-00259.
Research and Development
We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain other emerging product and technology opportunities. Expenditures for research and development in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $100.5 million, $92.8 million and $64.1 million, respectively. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into our customers’ products at competitive prices. Our future success may also depend on increasing acoustic content in our customers’ products including assisting our customers with integration of our products and software into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp.

Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2016 through 2035. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2016, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development. We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for KNOWLES, Knowles logo designs, along with various other trademarks. These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce. We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business. To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties.
Seasonality
In general, our businesses tend to have higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each calendar year. This is particularly true of those businesses that serve the consumer electronics market. Our businesses tend to have short product cycles due to the highly technical nature of the industries they serve which can result in new OEM product launches that can impact quarterly revenues, earnings and cash flow.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water and soil; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; and requirements with respect to treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws.
We are dedicated to the preservation and improvement of our global environment. To help achieve this, we have established a Green Materials Policy pursuant to which we have established a Green Materials Standard. The products we offer are in compliance with the EU RoHS/WEEE regulations. The regulations aim to restrict of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
Employees
We currently employ approximately 8,000 persons across our facilities in 12 countries. Approximately 81% of these employees are located in Asia. We are subject to various local, national and multi-national laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees. Our workforce in the United States is not unionized, however in the European Union, we have established workers councils composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe we generally have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
Other Information
We post our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports on the "SEC Filings” link on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.knowles.com. We post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
