ITEM 1:
BUSINESS
 
Silverton Energy, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 21, 2010, with fiscal year of September 30. We are currently have no operations and are a “shell company” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We were founded with the intent of producing environmentally aware footwear, but we abandoned this business in 2013.
 
We are currently assessing our options as how, and if, to proceed as a business. We believe that our most likely scenario for survival is to merge with and into or to acquire an existing business. To that end, we are seeking merger candidates and intend to take steps to make us a more attractive merger candidate.
 
If we are unable to begin a new business or enter into a merger with or acquire an existing business, we will need to raise additional funds to continue as a business. If we cannot secure additional funds we will have to cease our business and our investors will lose their entire investment.
