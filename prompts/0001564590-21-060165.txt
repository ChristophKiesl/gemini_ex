ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 PHX Minerals Inc. was founded in Range, Texas County, Oklahoma, in 1926, as Panhandle Cooperative Royalty Company. The Company operated as a cooperative until 1979, when it merged into Panhandle Royalty Company and its shares became publicly traded. On April 2, 2007, the Company changed its name to Panhandle Oil and Gas Inc., and on October 8, 2020, the Company changed its name to PHX Minerals Inc. 
 PHX Minerals Inc. is an Oklahoma City-based company focused on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership in resource plays in the United States. Prior to a strategy change in 2019, the Company participated with a working interest on some of its mineral and leasehold acreage and as a result still holds legacy interests in leasehold acreage and non-operated working interests in natural gas and oil properties.
 Strategic Focus on Mineral Ownership
 During fiscal year 2019, we made the strategic decision to focus on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership and growth by acquiring minerals in our core areas of focus and by developing our significant mineral acreage inventory. In accordance with this new strategy, we have ceased taking any working interest positions on our mineral and leasehold acreage. During fiscal years 2020 and 2021, we did not participate with a working interest in the drilling of any new wells. We believe that our strategy to focus on mineral ownership is the best path forward to provide our shareholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investments. 
 A “mineral fee” is an interest in real property in which the owner owns all of the rights to the minerals under the surface forever, as compared to a mineral lease in which the lessee’s rights end at the expiration of the lease term or after production in paying quantities ceases with respect to the lease or the lease otherwise terminates in accordance with its terms. Generally, the mineral interest owner of a mineral fee interest reserves a non-cost bearing royalty interest upon the lease of such gas, oil, and other minerals to a gas and oil exploration and development company. Such companies lease such mineral interests from the fee mineral owner for a term with the expectation of producing natural gas and oil, thereby generating free cash flow from bonuses and royalties to the mineral interest owner. 
 As referenced above, our leasehold interests, rather than our mineral interests, are non-operated working interests. These non-operated working interests require us to contribute our proportionate share of the costs incurred by the operator in the development of such minerals. As discussed above and further below, since the end of 2019 and going forward, we no longer seek to participate with such working interests and have started a process of divesting working interests and redeploying the proceeds into high quality mineral and royalty properties. Our producing mineral and leasehold properties are located primarily in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota and Arkansas.
 Although a significant amount of our revenues is currently derived from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL from our working interests, a growing portion of our revenues is derived from lease bonus payments and royalties generated from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL. These royalties are tied to our perpetual ownership of mineral acreage, unless we sell such mineral interests. Royalties are due and payable whenever the operator of such interest produces and sells natural gas, oil or NGL from wells located on our mineral acreage.
 As of September 30, 2021, we owned approximately 251,600 perpetual mineral acres, as detailed in the table below:
 1


 
Play | Net Acres | | % Producing | | % Leased But Not Producing | | % Unleased | 
-------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+------+----------------------------+-----+------------+----
SCOOP | | 6,837 | | 63% | | 7% | | 30%
STACK | | 5,814 | | 89% | | 5% | | 6% 
Haynesville | | 1,318 | | 100% | | 0% | | 0% 
Bakken/Three Forks | | 3,106 | | 89% | | 0% | | 11%
Arkoma Stack | | 11,576 | | 64% | | 2% | | 34%
Permian | | 35,931 | | 8% | | 17% | | 75%
Fayetteville | | 9,871 | | 72% | | 0% | | 28%
Other | | 177,147 | | 19% | | 3% | | 78%
Total: | | 251,600 | | 25% | | 5% | | 70%

 Approximately 30% of our net minerals are currently under lease with an operator and 25% have a producing well. Additionally, 70% of our net mineral position is currently unleased, providing the opportunity, through potential future leases, to generate additional cash flow from bonus payments and royalties without spending additional capital. We also own working interests, royalty interests or both, in 6,457 producing natural gas and oil wells and 277 wells in the process of being drilled or completed. 
 Exploration and development of our natural gas and oil properties are conducted by natural gas and oil exploration and production companies, which typically are larger, independent oil and gas operating companies. We do not operate any natural gas and oil properties. While we previously were an active working interest participant in wells drilled on our mineral and leasehold acreage, we now focus on growth through mineral acquisitions and through development of our significant mineral acreage inventory.
 We intend to maximize shareholder value through the acquisition of mineral acreage in the core areas of resource plays with substantial undeveloped opportunities, divestiture of non-core minerals with limited optionality when the amount negotiated exceeds our projected total value, and proactive leasing of our mineral holdings.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our principal business objective is to maximize shareholder value. At the end of 2019, we made the strategic decision to cease taking working interest positions on our mineral and leasehold acreage. Our focus since then has been on growth through mineral acquisitions and by developing our significant mineral acreage inventory in our core areas. We believe this is the best path to provide our shareholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investment. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following corporate strategies:

• | Actively Manage Mineral and Leasehold Assets as a Portfolio to Maximize Value. We plan to manage our mineral and leasehold assets through the following:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Increasing our mineral fee holdings by acquiring mineral acreage in the core areas of natural gas and oil resource plays with substantial undeveloped opportunities that meet or exceed our minimum return threshold;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Utilizing in-house geology and engineering expertise as a competitive advantage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Proactively leasing our unleased mineral holdings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


o | High-grading our asset base by: (a) selectively divesting non-core minerals when anticipated sales price exceeds our projected total value, (b) optimizing our leasehold and working interest positions through strategic sales and farmouts of such assets, and (c) redeploying proceeds from sales into our core areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain a Stable and Well Capitalized Balance Sheet. We plan to maintain a strong financial position through the following:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Maintaining a conservative amount of debt outstanding to ensure our ability to successfully operate in all business and commodity environments; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Hedging our future natural gas and oil prices to manage commodity price risk and protect our cash flow.

Our Business Strengths
 We believe the following attributes position us to achieve our objectives:
  
• | Focusing on Perpetual Mineral Fee Ownership. Our strategic decision to focus on mineral ownership provides us with the perpetual option to benefit from future development and technology. We are focused on generating meaningful revenues through lease bonuses and royalty interests, and our royalty revenue as a percentage of total revenue continues to increase. As of September 30, 2021, we owned approximately 251,600 net mineral acres located primarily in Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, Louisiana and Arkansas. We also own working interests, royalty interests, or both, in 6,457 producing natural gas and oil wells and 277 wells in the process of being drilled or completed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mineral and Leasehold Ownership in Multiple Top-Tier Resource Plays. We own mineral and leasehold interests in multiple top-tier resource plays in the United States, including positions in the SCOOP, STACK, Haynesville, Bakken/Three Forks, Arkoma Woodford, Eagle Ford, Permian Basin and Fayetteville plays. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL from these positions. During fiscal year 2021, production on our acreage averaged 24,864 Mcfed with approximately 74%, 15% and 11% of such volumes derived from the production of natural gas, oil and NGL, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Material Undeveloped Mineral Position in Gas and Oil Producing Basins. Over 70% of our mineral fee position is currently unleased or not currently producing, providing us with the opportunity to generate additional cash flows from bonus payments and royalties without deploying additional capital. We have an active program in place focused on leasing open acreage to generate additional lease bonus revenue and future royalty revenue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable and Flexible Financial Position. We maintain a stable and flexible financial position by actively managing our debt, cash and working capital. We hedge to manage commodity price risk and to protect our balance sheet and cash flow.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced Management and Technical Team. We have a management and technical team with extensive experience in the oil and gas industry. Our management and technical team members average over 20 years of industry experience in each applicable area of the Company, including accounting, land, geology, engineering and mergers and acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Principal Products and Markets
 We derive our revenue through bonus and royalty payments and from working interests on our mineral and leasehold acreage. Our principal products from the production associated with our royalty and non-operated interests, in order of revenue generated, are natural gas, crude oil and NGL. These products are generally sold by well operators to various purchasers, including pipeline and marketing companies, which service the areas where the producing wells are located. Since we do not operate any of the wells in which we own an interest, we must rely on the operating expertise of numerous companies that operate the wells in which we own interests, including expertise in the drilling and completion of new wells, producing well operations and, in most cases, the marketing or purchasing of production from the wells. We receive payment from natural gas, oil and NGL sales from the well operator or the contracted purchaser. 
 Prices of natural gas, oil and NGL are dependent on numerous factors beyond our control, including supply and demand, competition, weather, international events and geo-political circumstances, actions taken by OPEC and economic, political and regulatory developments. Since demand for natural gas is subject to weather conditions, prices received for our natural gas production may be subject to seasonal variations. 
 We enter into price risk management financial instruments (derivatives) to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in the price of natural gas and oil and to protect our return on investments. The derivative contracts apply only to a portion of our natural gas and oil production, provide only partial price protection against declines in natural gas and oil prices and may limit the benefit of future increases in natural gas and oil prices. Please see Item 7A – “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and Note 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding the derivative contracts we enter into.
 Competitive Business Conditions
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, particularly with respect to attempting to acquire additional fee mineral interests and natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. Many factors beyond our control affect our competitive position. Some of these factors include: the quantity and price of foreign oil imports; domestic supply and deliverability of natural gas, oil and NGL; 
 3


changes in prices received for natural gas, oil and NGL production; business and consumer demand for refined natural gas, oil products and NGL; and the effects of federal, state and local regulation of the exploration for, production of and sales of natural gas, oil and NGL (see Item 1A – “Risk Factors”). Many companies have substantially greater resources than we have, and such companies may have more resources to evaluate, bid for and purchase more mineral fee, royalty and similar interests than our financial or human resources permit.
 We do not operate any of the wells in which we have an interest; rather, we rely on operating companies with greater resources, staff, equipment, research and experience for both drilling and production of gas and oil wells. Our business strategy is to use our stable and flexible financial position, coupled with our own geologic and economic evaluations, to acquire new mineral acreage and to lease or farmout our mineral and leasehold acreage interests. We believe this strategy allows us to compete effectively in a competitive mineral market; however, our ability to acquire additional mineral fee, royalty and similar interests in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 Major Customers
 Our natural gas, oil and NGL production is sold, in most cases, through our lessees or well operators to numerous different purchasers. The loss of certain major purchasers of natural gas, oil and NGL production could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce and sell, through our lessees or well operators, natural gas, oil and NGL production. The following table shows sales to major purchasers, by percentage, through various operators/purchasers during 2021, 2020 and 2019.

 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
----------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
Company A | | 14 | % | | 23 | % | 23 | %
Company B | | 7 | % | | 6 | % | 8 | %
Company C | | 0 | % | | 5 | % | 8 | %

Regulation of the Natural Gas and Oil Industry
 General
 As the owner of mineral fee interests and non-operating working interests, we do not have any employees or contractors actually operating in the field, and we are not directly subject to many of the regulations of the oil and gas industry. The following disclosure describes regulations and environmental matters more directly associated with operators of natural gas and oil properties, including our current operators. Since we do not operate any wells in which we have interests, actual compliance with many laws and regulations is controlled by the well operators, and we are responsible only for our proportionate share of the costs, if any, involved on wells in which we own a working interest.
 Natural gas and oil operations are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. Legislation and regulation affecting the entire oil and natural gas industry is continuously being reviewed for potential revision. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply.
 Although we are generally not directly subject to many of the rules, regulations and limitations impacting the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry as a whole, companies that operate our interests may be impacted by such rules and regulations and we may be responsible for our proportionate share of costs for wells on which we own a working interest. While we may be partially insulated from compliance costs applicable to our operator-lessees, we may still be indirectly impacted by operator regulations because our revenue stream depends on operators complying with applicable laws and regulations that govern the production of natural gas, oil and NGL.
 Regulation of Drilling and Production
 The production of natural gas and oil is subject to regulation under federal, state and local statutes, rules, orders and regulations. These statutes and regulations require that operators obtain permits for drilling operations and drilling bonds, as well as provide for reporting requirements concerning operations. Additionally, the state regulatory agencies where we own mineral and leasehold interests have enacted regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from natural gas and oil wells, the regulation of well spacing and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of natural gas and oil that can be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations which can be drilled. Additionally, some 
 4


states where we hold mineral or leasehold interests may impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL within the applicable jurisdictions.
 Regulation of Transportation of Oil
 The sale and transportation of our crude oil is generally undertaken by the operators (or by third parties at the direction of the operators) of our properties. Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGL are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices; however, Congress has enacted price controls in the past and could reenact price controls in the future.
 Sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. 
 Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas
 The sale and transportation of our natural gas is generally undertaken by the operators (or by third parties at the direction of the operators) of our properties. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 The FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
 Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state.
 Environmental Compliance and Risks
 Our operators and properties are impacted by extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and relating to safety and health.
 Natural gas and oil exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Historically, most of the environmental regulation of gas and oil production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is significant natural gas and oil production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). However, there are various regulations issued by the EPA and other governmental agencies that would govern significant spills, blow-outs or uncontrolled emissions.
 Many states, including states where we own properties, have enacted natural gas and oil regulations that apply to the drilling, completion and operations of wells and the disposal of waste oil and salt water. The operators of our properties are subject to such regulations. There are also procedures incident to the plugging and abandonment of dry holes or other non-operational wells, all as governed by the applicable governing state agency.
 At the federal level, among the more significant laws and regulations that may affect our business and the oil and natural gas industry are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as “CERCLA” or 
 5


“Superfund”; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as “RCRA”; the Clean Air Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
 Since we do not operate any wells in which we own an interest, actual compliance with environmental laws is controlled by the well operators, and we are only responsible for our proportionate share of the costs for wells in which we own a working interest. As such, we have no knowledge of any instances of non-compliance with existing laws and regulations. We maintain insurance coverage at levels customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Taxes
 Our natural gas and oil properties are subject to various taxes, such as gross production taxes and, in some cases, ad valorem taxes, which we pay on minerals we own.
Employees
 At September 30, 2021, we had 20 full-time employees, including our executive officers, and did not have any part-time employees.
