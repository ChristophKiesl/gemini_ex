ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We are an energy company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation and/or development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. We are primarily focused on the acquisition of early-stage projects, the development and delineation of these projects, and then the monetization of those assets once these activities are completed.
 
Since 2010, our primary focus has been the development of interests in oil and gas projects we hold in the Permian Basin in West Texas. Presently, our primary interests include the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas and the Hazel Project in the Midland Basin. In November 2020, we sold our interest in the project in Winkler County, Texas.
 
We employ a private equity model within a public platform, with the goal to (i) enter into a play at favorable valuations, (ii) prove up and delineate the play through committed capital and exhaustive geologic and engineering review, and (iii) monetize our position through an exit to public and private independents that can continue full-scale development. Rich Masterson, our consulting geologist, has originated several of our current plays, as discussed below, based on his tenure as a geologist since 1974. He is credited with originating the Wolfbone shale play in the Southern Delaware Basin of West Texas and has prepared prospects totaling over 150,000 acres that have been leased, drilled and are currently being developed by Devon Energy Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Noble Energy, and Samson Oil & Gas Ltd., among others.
 
In April 2018, we announced that we have commenced a process that could result in the monetization of the Hazel Project. Pursuant to our corporate strategy, in our opinion the development activity at the Hazel Project, coupled with nearby activities of other oil and gas operators, is indicative of this project having achieved a level of value that suggests monetization. We believe that the liquidity that would be provided from selling the Hazel Project could be redeployed into the Orogrande Project. In August 2020, our subsidiaries entered into an option agreement with a third party (which was amended in September 2020), under which, in exchange for satisfying certain drilling obligations, the third party will have the option to purchase the entire Hazel Project by a date no later than May 31, 2021. In January 2021, the third party notified us of its intent to exercise its option to perform operations sufficient to satisfy the remaining drilling obligations. The option to purchase the Hazel Project may never be exercised.
 
We are also currently marketing the Orogrande Project for an outright sale or farm in partner. These efforts are continuing.
 
We operate our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (TEI), Hudspeth Oil Corporation, a Texas corporation, (Hudspeth), and Torchlight Hazel, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. We are in the process of winding up our subsidiaries Warwink Properties, LLC and Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC. We currently have four full-time employees and we employ consultants for various roles as needed.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 5700 W. Plano Parkway, Suite 3600, Plano, Texas 75093. The telephone number of our principal executive offices is (214) 432-8002. 
 
Arrangement Agreement with Meta
 
On December 14, 2020, we and our newly formed subsidiaries, Metamaterial Exchangeco Inc. (Canco) and 2798831 Ontario Inc. (Callco), both Ontario corporations, entered into an arrangement agreement (the Arrangement Agreement) with Metamaterial Inc., an Ontario corporation headquartered in Nova Scotia, Canada (Meta). Under the Arrangement Agreement, Canco is to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Meta by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario), or the Arrangement, on and subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement. On February 3, 2021, and on March 11, 2020, we and our Ontario subsidiaries entered into an amendment to the Arrangement Agreement with Meta. All references to the Arrangement Agreement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to the Arrangement Agreement as amended.
 
The Arrangement Agreement provides that the Meta shareholders may elect to receive either shares of our common stock or shares of the capital stock of Canco, which are referred to as the Exchangeable Shares, in exchange for such holders Meta common shares, in each case based on an exchange ratio (the Exchange Ratio) to be determined based on the number of Meta common shares and shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement (the Effective Time). After the Effective Time, each Exchangeable Share will be exchangeable by the holder for one share of the common stock of the combined company (subject to customary adjustments for stock splits or other reorganizations). In addition, we may require all outstanding Exchangeable Shares to be exchanged upon the occurrence of certain events and at any time following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the Arrangement. While outstanding, holders of Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to cast votes on matters for which holders of the common stock of the combined company are entitled to vote, and will be entitled to receive dividends economically equivalent to the dividends declared by the combined company with respect to its common stock. Eligibility to receive Exchangeable Shares will be subject to certain Canadian residency restrictions and tax statuses.

The Arrangement Agreement additionally makes provision for the conversion or amendment of other outstanding Meta securities, including options, deferred share units and warrants, such that they will be exercisable for shares of the common stock of the combined company, in each case with adjustments based on the Exchange Ratio.
 
Immediately following the Effective Time, based on the Exchange Ratio, the former shareholders of Meta are anticipated to own approximately 75% of the economic and voting interest of the combined company, with current Torchlight stockholders holding approximately 25% economic and voting interest. Following the Effective Time, the combined companys board of directors will be comprised of seven directors, with five of such directors to be nominees of Meta, one to be jointly nominated by Meta and Torchlight and one director to be a nominee of Torchlight, subject to the reasonable approval of Meta. Additionally, the current management of Torchlight will resign and be replaced by George Palikaras as Chief Executive Officer and Kenneth Rice as Chief Financial Officer.
 
Under the Arrangement Agreement, Torchlight will also submit to its stockholders a proposal to approve the issuance of stock under the Arrangement Agreement and amend Torchlights articles of incorporation to effect a reverse split (the Reverse Split), to maintain compliance with the listing standards of Nasdaq. In connection therewith, on February 4, 2021, we filed a preliminary proxy statement (the Proxy), with the SEC.
 
Following the Reverse Split, and prior to the Effective Time, Torchlight will declare and issue a dividend, on a pro rata basis, of shares of Series A preferred stock, (the Series A Preferred Stock), with the rights set forth in the Series A certificate of designation, (the Series A Certificate of Designation) which is attached as Annex H of the Proxy, to the holders of its common stock. Following the Effective Time, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend based on the net proceeds of the sale of any assets that are used or held for use in our oil and gas exploration business, (the O&G Assets), subject to certain holdbacks. Such asset sales must occur prior to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 or (ii) the date which is six months from the closing of the Arrangement, (the Sale Expiration Date). Following the Sale Expiration Date, subject to certain conditions, the combined company will effect a spin-off of any remaining O&G Assets with the Series A Preferred Stock holders to receive their pro rata equity interest in the spin-off entity.
 
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of Meta, and shareholders representing 48.06% of Metas common shares have entered into voting and support agreements in connection with the Arrangement. The transaction has also been unanimously approved by our board of directors, and stockholders representing 19.74% of our common stock have entered into voting and support agreements in connection with the Arrangement.
 
The consummation of the Arrangement is subject to certain closing conditions, including without limitation the requirement that (i) prior to the effective time of the Arrangement, we raise gross proceeds of at least $10 million through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, less the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest on certain loans that we have made to Meta (the Pre-Closing Financing) which condition has been met (ii) all of our debt is converted into shares of our common stock or repaid in full, with certain exceptions available and (iii) the shares issuable in connection with the arrangement have been approved for listing on Nasdaq. Other closing conditions include without limitation the receipt of all required approvals from our stockholders and Metas shareholders and from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), (the Court) and all other required regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either us or Meta. As of the date of this filing all of our notes payable have been retired.
 
The Arrangement is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and is to be implemented by way of an arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). The Arrangement Agreement provides for customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants of each party to (i) subject to certain exceptions, carry on its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the execution of the Arrangement Agreement and the Effective Time and (ii) not solicit any alternate transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, to engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Arrangement Agreement may be terminated by either party after May 15, 2021, and if the Arrangement Agreement is terminated prior to that date by either party as a result of obtaining a superior proposal from a third party, such terminating party is required to pay a termination fee of $2 million.
 
Under the Arrangement Agreement, we loaned Meta $500,000 on December 16, 2020, in exchange for an unsecured convertible promissory note in substantially the same form as the 8% unsecured convertible promissory note that evidences our loan to Meta of $500,000 on September 20, 2020. On February 18, 2021, Torchlight loaned to Meta $10,000,000, evidenced by an unsecured convertible promissory note issued by Meta (the Promissory Note), substantially in the same form as the previous bridge notes issued by Meta to us, to satisfy Torchlights requirement to provide additional bridge financing to Meta pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement. These three bridge loans, including the aggregate principal and unpaid interest, will be included in, and credited against, the funds we are obligated to raise in the Pre-Closing Financing. Upon the closing of the Arrangement, all of the bridge notes will be deemed cancelled and paid in full.

Key Torchlight Business Attributes
 
Experienced People. We build on the expertise and experiences of our management team, including John Brda and Roger Wurtele. We will also receive guidance from outside advisors as well as our Board of Directors and will align with high quality exploration and technical partners.
 
Project Focus. We are focusing primarily on exploitation projects by pursuing resources in areas where commercial production has already been established but where opportunity for additional and nearby development is indicated. We may pursue high risk exploration prospects which may appear less favored than low risk exploration. We will, however, consider these high risk-high reward exploration prospects in connection with exploitation opportunities in a project that would reduce the overall project economic risk. We will consider such high risk-high reward prospects on their individual merits.
 
Lower Cost Structure. We will attempt to maintain the lowest possible cost structure, enabling the greatest margins and providing opportunities for investment that would not be feasible for higher cost competitors.
 
Limit Capital Risks. Limited capital exposure is planned initially to add value to a project and determine its economic viability. Projects are staged and have options before additional capital is invested. We will limit our exposure in any one project by participating at reduced working interest levels, thereby being able to diversify with limited capital. Management has experience in successfully managing risks of projects, finance, and value.

Business Processes
 
We believe there are three principal business processes that we must follow to enable our operations to be profitable. Each major business process offers the opportunity for a distinct partner or alliance as we grow. These processes are:

● | Investment Evaluation and Review;
--+----------------------------------


● | Operations and Field Activities; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | Administrative and Finance Management.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Investment Evaluation and Review. This process is the key ingredient to our success. Recognition of quality investment opportunities is the fuel that drives our engine. Broadly, this process includes the following activities: prospect acquisition, regional and local geological and geophysical evaluations, data processing, economic analysis, lease acquisition and negotiations, permitting, and field supervision. We expect these evaluation processes to be managed by our management team. Expert or specific technical support will be outsourced as needed. Only if a project is taken to development, and only then, will additional staff be hired. New personnel will have very specific responsibilities. We anticipate attractive investment opportunities to be presented from outside companies and from the large informal community of geoscientists and engineers. Building a network of advisors is key to the pipeline of high-quality opportunities.
 
Operations and Field Activities. This process begins following management approval of an investment. Well site supervision, construction, drilling, logging, product marketing, and transportation are examples of some activities. We will prefer to be the operator, but when operations are not possible, we will farm-out sufficient interests to third parties that will be responsible for these operating activities. We provide personnel to monitor these activities and associated costs.
 
Administrative and Finance Management. This process coordinates our initial structuring and capitalization, general operations and accounting, reporting, audit, banking and cash management, regulatory agencies reporting and interaction, timely and accurate payment of royalties, taxes, leases rentals, vendor accounts and performance management that includes budgeting and maintenance of financial controls, and interface with legal counsel and tax and other financial and business advisors.
 
Current Projects
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had interests in three oil and gas projects: the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas, the Hazel Project in Sterling, Tom Green, and Irion Counties, Texas, and the Hunton wells in partnership with Kodiak in Central Oklahoma
 
See the description under Current Projects below under Note 4, Oil & Gas Properties, of the financial statements included with this report for information and disclosure regarding these projects, which description is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
Industry and Business Environment
 
We are experiencing a time of fluctuating oil prices caused by lower demand, higher US Supply, and OPECs policies on production. Unfortunately, this is the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. We experience highs and lows that seem to come in cycles. Fortunately, advances in technology drive the US market and we feel this will drive the development costs down on our exploration and drilling programs.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we will compete with numerous other companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas. Some of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also many carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. They may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.
 
Our larger or integrated competitors may have the resources to be better able to absorb the burden of current and future federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to locate reserves and acquire interests in properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
The market for oil and natural gas that we will produce depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels, and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.
 
Our oil production is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is expected to be sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. We will rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production.
 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations, and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole.
 
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
 
Our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations, when developed, will be subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal, and local authorities and agencies. Certain states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging, and abandonment of such wells. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations and properties are and will be subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation, and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. In the future, environmental legislation and regulation may trend toward stricter standards. These laws and regulations may:

● | require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit construction, drilling, and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict certain areas from fracking and other stimulation techniques.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
 
The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are and will be in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint, and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.
 
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish, and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force our company to discontinue certain operations altogether.
 
Hydraulic fracturing is regulated by state and federal oil and gas regulatory authorities, including specifically the requirement to disclose certain information related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Operators must follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management on federal acreage). Furthermore, well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, in light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells and hydraulic fracturing, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. Further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we or our operators are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
 
Climate Change
 
Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Many states and the federal government have enacted legislation directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions or requirements in connection with our drilling and production activities and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could affect operating costs and demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted at controlling climate change.
Employees
 
We currently have four full time employees and no part time employees. We employ consultants and contract help as needed. We anticipate, as needed, we will add additional employees, and we will continue using independent contractors, consultants, attorneys, and accountants as necessary to complement services rendered by our employees. We presently have independent technical professionals under consulting agreements who are available to us on an as needed basis.
Research and Development
 
We did not spend any funds on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
