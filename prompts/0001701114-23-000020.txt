ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Blue Apron's vision is Better Living Through Better Food™. Founded in 2012, we are on a mission to spark discovery, connection and joy through cooking. We offer fresh, chef-designed recipes that empower our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference cooking quality food can make in their lives. 
Our core product is the meal experience we help our customers create. These experiences extend from discovering new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques to preparing meals with families and loved ones to sharing photos and stories of culinary triumphs. Central to these experiences are the original recipes we design with fresh, seasonally-inspired produce and high-quality ingredients sent directly to our customers. We also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals or can be purchased à la carte, through Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service. Through Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce platform, we sell a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, which are tested and recommended by our culinary team. Our products are available to purchase through our website, mobile app, and beginning in the second quarter of 2022, our meal kits are also available for sale on third-party sales platforms. Our customers span ages, geographies, income brackets, and levels of culinary expertise. They include young couples, families, singles, and empty nesters. Our passionate community of home cooks tell us, through emails, phone calls, and social media, how much Blue Apron has changed their lives.
Central to our operations, we have developed an integrated network that employs technology and expertise across many disciplines. Our supply-demand coordination activities––demand planning, recipe creation, procurement, recipe merchandising, fulfillment operations, distribution, customer service, and marketing––drive our end-to-end value chain. 
Our Products
Meals
On our direct-to-consumer platform, we strive to offer our customers a balanced mix of ingredients, cuisines, familiarity, discovery, and preparation times. We are focused on offering a variety of choices every week, including a range of recipes designed for a healthy lifestyle, so that customers can make selections based on their individual or household needs and preferences. We currently offer our customers four weekly meal plans - a Two-Serving Signature Plan, a Two-Serving Vegetarian Plan, a Two-Serving Wellness Plan, and a Four-Serving Signature Plan. 
For meal plans, customers have the flexibility to choose any combination of the core recipes offered in any week, regardless of their plan. For each Order per week, this includes a minimum of two recipes with up to sixteen choices on the Two-Serving Plan and a minimum of two recipes with up to fourteen choices on the Four-Serving Plan. Beginning in 2022, the weekly main course recipe options also include two Ready to Cook recipes, which are shipped with a recyclable cooking tray and require no knife work or chopping. In addition, each week customers can add unlimited Add-ons recipes to each Order, which includes breakfast, appetizers, side dishes, desserts, à la carte proteins, and/or Heat & Eat meals, which are microwavable meals ready in minutes.
Customers are also able to purchase a second Order each week, allowing them to select additional recipes per week at staggered times, or double recipes to serve up to eight people per meal on the Four-Serving Plan. In 2021, Blue Apron also introduced a select number of meal kits that are available for purchase on Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce market, without a subscription. In 2022, we expanded the optionality to purchase non-subscription boxes to third-party e-commerce channels. 
Based on the number of Orders in 2022 per plan type, approximately 80% of our meal orders were for the Two-Serving Plan, and approximately 20% were for the Four-Serving Plan. Our customers can tailor their orders to complement their individual tastes and lifestyles. Some customers prefer to let our recipe recommendation algorithm choose their recipes based on the food preferences they have provided to us, while other customers actively choose several weeks in advance of delivery which recipes to receive. Customers can choose to receive orders each week, or less frequently if that better suits their schedules. Customers can make their weekly order selections on our website or through our mobile application.
In addition, customers have the option to customize some of their recipe selections, such as the ability to upgrade a protein for a more premium protein, replace a meat with a plant protein, or increase the serving size from two to four. We also offer Premium recipes, including our Craft offering, that introduce our customers to specialty protein combinations, advanced culinary techniques, and unique flavor twists. Both our customized options and Premium recipes are priced at a premium to our standard rates. We also sell seasonally-inspired occasion-based offerings throughout the year consisting of multiple recipes for six to eight people, which we sell as part of our subscription meal plan, along with the Blue Apron Market and third-party e-commerce channels.
Our culinary team, including chefs who are alumni of some of the best restaurants in the world, such as Michelin-starred Per Se and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, begins the recipe creation process with various seasonally-inspired ingredients. Our chefs apply to these raw ingredients their expertise and insights from our customer feedback and recipe ratings to create our recipe offerings, with an eye towards what is delicious and accessible for individuals and families to eat week in and week out.
We merchandise our recipes through various campaigns geared toward seasonality, dietary preferences, ingredients, and healthy lifestyles. Our approach to menu design seeks to balance ingredient supply and cost while appealing to a variety of customer lifestyles and cooking attitudes across a broad range of demographics and taste profiles. 
We are committed to sourcing fresh produce and other high-quality ingredients year-round from our supplier network that includes farmers, ranchers, fisheries, and artisans. Our recipes change every week based on the season and often feature specialty ingredients not readily available elsewhere. By merchandising these ingredients into carefully crafted recipes, we are able to introduce our customers to ingredients they may have never experienced before. We also collaborate with suppliers to create ingredients specifically for our recipes, such as custom sauces, unique spice blends, or, for example, bespoke ramen noodles from a third-generation noodle maker.
Our ingredient standards are critically important to us and our customers. We source only ingredients that are as sustainable as possible. All of our beef, poultry, and pork comes from animals not treated with added hormones or sub-therapeutic antibiotics, and our eggs are Certified Humane Raised and Handled® pasture raised. Similarly, we source high-quality seafood consistent with the standards established by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, one of the world’s most respected sustainable seafood organizations, and we prioritize sourcing seafood with additional third-party verified sustainability certifications.
Wine
Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service, uses an integrated supply chain and direct sourcing relationships to deliver high-quality wines at compelling values. We work directly with vineyards and consult with acclaimed winemakers to create custom Blue Apron wines that are specially crafted for our customers and uniquely curated to pair with our meals. Our wines included in our monthly wine delivery service are sized for a dinner for two (in 500ml bottles, rather than traditional 750ml bottles). Customers have the flexibility to customize their box, choosing six bottles from a monthly selection of wines that best meet their taste preferences. A pairing key system provides insight into the wine profiles, and enables customers to pair their Blue Apron meals and wines. Our wine offerings include curated red, white, rosé and sparkling wines, tasting notes, pairing tips, and the story behind each wine. We are a licensed winery, and currently ship directly to customers in 31 states and Washington, D.C.
As with our meals, customers may choose to actively manage their monthly wine orders by adjusting deliveries to fit their schedules, or they may simply sign up and receive one or two deliveries each month. Wine customers can also order a second box per monthly cycle. In addition to our monthly wine service, customers have the ability to order curated assortments and wine by 500ml and 750ml bottles, half-case, case, or other bundles on the Blue Apron Market, outside of the monthly subscription model.
Market
Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce market, features a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, pantry items, and add-on products for different culinary occasions, which are tested in our test kitchen and recommended by our culinary team. A number of these items are not available elsewhere, and we regularly evaluate expanding our exclusive items and partnerships. Our recipe cards feature cooking tools and utensils from Blue Apron Market, creating an integrated brand experience for our community of home cooks and repeated merchandising opportunities for our company. A selection of non-subscription meal kit boxes and our wines are also sold on the Blue Apron Market website.
Digital Experience 
Customers can find recipes, register their dietary preferences, manage their accounts, and make purchases on our website or on our iOS and Android mobile applications. Our digital customer experience is immersive: we offer how-to cooking videos, stories about our suppliers, a step-by-step interactive cook along, and our collection of thousands of recipes that customers can access on their own.
How We Do It
We have created an integrated network that enables us to source high quality, differentiated ingredients, design original recipes around those ingredients, and combine them into meaningful cooking experiences that we deliver to customers across the contiguous United States. Our interconnected end-to-end value chain allows us to execute cost-effectively and at scale. Coordination between our culinary team, procurement and operations teams, our marketing practices, and technology tools help us pair customer demand with supply, as well as to work with our suppliers to deliver high quality food at compelling values. Our kitchen manufacturing, fulfillment and logistics operations are built to support our ongoing product innovation.
Supply-Demand Coordination 
Our supply-demand coordination activities include demand planning, recipe development, recipe merchandising, and marketing. We use near-term and long-term demand forecasting based on proprietary data and software to inform decisions along our value chain, including fulfillment center capacity and ingredient purchasing. This process continues through recipe development, and merchandising, as we craft recipes around available ingredients, and have the ability to make adjustments up to just a few weeks prior to fulfillment. We have also tailored our marketing strategies based on these demand forecasts and planning to optimize our marketing return on investment.
Supplier Relationships
Our deep supplier relationships provide us the ability to source high quality ingredients. This enables us to collaborate on demand planning to manage inventories and optimize yields in effort to reduce waste and cost while minimizing our supply chain footprint. Blue Apron often aims to work directly with farmers when practicable to ensure customers receive high quality, seasonally-inspired produce at optimal freshness, at the best value. We source from farmers, ranchers, fisheries, and other suppliers of meat, seafood, and poultry products that meet our animal welfare standards, enabling us to provide premium ingredients to our customers such as pasture raised beef and Certified Humane Raised and Handled® pasture raised eggs. 
Operations
Our purchasing, production, fulfillment, and logistics operations are integrated with our demand management and supplier relationships. Successfully integrating these disparate activities requires us to possess a variety of competencies: a team with deep, ingredient-specific expertise; a technology-enabled platform that connects our end-to-end operations; and a scalable architecture that adapts to surges in demand as well as variations in available supply. Our enhanced planning and process-driven strategies enable us to make informed purchasing decisions and provide opportunities to better manage food costs, allocate labor and reduce waste in our fulfillment centers.
Informed Purchasing
While we work directly with our suppliers months in advance to plan our supply needs, we place purchase orders closer to the expected fulfillment, after coordinating supply and demand through processes such as recipe merchandising and analyzing the outputs of our demand planning and forecasting tools.
Production and Fulfillment
As of December 31, 2022, we operated two fulfillment centers. Our fulfillment centers are designed to effectively manage our variable, high-throughput, perishable inventory, as well as flexible production and labor needs. We have invested extensively in our fulfillment centers, including the opening of our Linden, New Jersey center in 2017 and the implementation of automation equipment in our Linden and Richmond, California fulfillment centers, and continue to optimize our network with a focus on maximizing efficiencies. 
Because we prep and ship perishable products, our fulfillment centers must adhere to stringent food safety standards, temperature protocols, and regulatory guidelines, and our fulfillment centers are staffed with trained professionals to ensure that our ingredients adhere to our food safety and quality standards. Our Linden and Richmond fulfillment centers are certified under the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Food Safety Code for Manufacturing nationwide, a globally recognized, independent food safety standard administered by the Safe Quality Food Institute.
To support our fulfillment operations we have developed proprietary technology, such as our proprietary inventory management tools to assess incoming ingredients for quality and our proprietary kitchen prep software that demonstrates to fulfillment center associates how to prep ingredients for each recipe, and provides instructions on selecting the correct type of packaging for each ingredient. We also use third-party technology in fulfillment operations to complement our proprietary systems. 
Logistics
Our logistics team designs, manages, and optimizes a ground-based delivery network of several third-party service providers capable of delivering within the contiguous United States. We analyze outbound logistics on a zip code by zip code basis to enable cost-effective and timely delivery of orders, while also adjusting the packaging of our ingredients and other components of our fulfillment operations based on the expected delivery route, weather, or ultimate destination. All of our packaging materials are chosen with environmental impact in mind. We select packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable when practicable. Our packaging innovation team, with the support of third-party sustainability experts, is focused on innovating to improve our packaging design, lower overall costs, and reduce our carbon footprint.
Our Brand and Marketing
We are continuing to build a consumer lifestyle brand that empowers our customers to embrace their culinary curiosity and challenge their abilities to see what a difference cooking quality food can make in their lives. Several nights a week, our customers invite us into their homes. We take part in some of the most joyful parts of their days, helping them create a meal for themselves, their families and their loved ones. Their challenges are opportunities for us to learn together, and their accomplishments are among our proudest achievements. We hear their success stories every day. Unlike a purely transactional e-commerce platform, we believe the emotional connection that customers have with our brand will enable us to have a more meaningful role in their lives. 
We believe in utilizing a strategic mix of marketing channels to efficiently add new customers as well as to engage and create value for our existing customers. This includes a diverse mix of online and offline channels, as well as strategic partnerships that enable us to expand our brand to new segments of customers. We deliberately focus on the marketing channels we believe to be the most efficient and on customer segments that have demonstrated stronger affinity and retention. We believe our customers continue to be some of our best marketers, and we see them share their Blue Apron moments through social media, blogs, and referrals. We also have a customer referral program through which certain existing customers may invite others to receive a single complimentary meal kit box.
For all of our products, we use a combination of paid, earned, and owned media to increase the awareness of our brand and attract new customers. Our content enables customers to connect and interact with our brand even when they are not cooking with us. For example, we leverage both our digital channels and printed content within deliveries to highlight specific ingredients, provide general cooking tips and techniques and foster conversation within our community of home cooks.
In addition, strategic brand partnerships are an important opportunity for us to leverage the platform we are building to add value for our existing customers and showcase our brand to new customer segments.
Finally, as we continue to promote our brand to attract new customers, we are focused on investments in marketing technology, especially in response to the ongoing elimination of cookie-based tracking. This work includes building out a customer data platform to better manage our first party data and investing in our engineering capabilities to improve overall user experience.
Our Customers
Our customers represent a broad range of demographics including a wide range of age groups and incomes. Customers of all kinds are able to successfully incorporate Blue Apron into a wide variety of lifestyles.

We also believe our customers roughly mirror the general geographical population distribution of the United States. According to the 2020 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, the top ten states account for 54% of total U.S. households. Similarly, we estimate that these states accounted for 53% of our customers in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Our Competition
The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we face an array of competitors from many different industry sectors. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) other food and meal delivery companies; (2) the supermarket industry, including online supermarket retailers; (3) a wide array of food retailers, including natural and organic, specialty, conventional, mass, discount, and other food retail formats; (4) casual dining and quick-service restaurants and other food service businesses in the restaurant industry; (5) online wine retailers, wine specialty stores, and retail liquor stores; and (6) food manufacturers, consumer packaged goods companies, providers of logistics services, and other food and ingredient producers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors upon which we compete include: marketing; variety and flexibility of product offering; price and value perception; brand reputation; product quality (including uniqueness of ingredients, flavors and techniques); customer satisfaction; convenience; food safety; customer service; and reliable and timely fulfillment.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology and our customer data, is an important factor in our strategy and the success of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and patent, and other intellectual property protections under applicable law. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also seek to protect and avoid disclosure of our intellectual property through confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees, and through appropriate agreements with our suppliers and others. We have two registered patents related to product packaging.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulatory requirements, including regulation of our food and wine operations.
Government Regulation of Food and Food Companies
Food companies, such as Blue Apron, are subject to extensive government regulation. Federal statutes applicable to food production include, for example, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act. Federal regulators have promulgated extensive regulatory schemes to implement these and other relevant statutes. These evolving regulatory structures govern matters including manufacturing, formulating, labeling, advertising, packaging, storing, and implementing safety measures for our food products. In particular, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, continues its implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act by promulgating substantial numbers of new regulations and introducing multiple versions of non-binding, draft guidance documents suggesting new compliance measures for the food industry. Understanding within the food industry of how to apply these regulations and the suggestions offered in FDA guidance documents continues to evolve.
State and local jurisdictions also regulate U.S. food manufacturing facilities. For example, we currently produce and fulfill products in the states of California and New Jersey. State and local governments exert regulatory authority over our operations in these jurisdictions. The states and localities in which a food production facility is located can impose registration, licensing, and inspection requirements in addition to those imposed by federal law. Some also enforce significant consumer protection-focused statutory schemes, which can impose additional costs and complexity on food producers.
Food companies in the United States are subject to government inspection with or without notice at any time, with concomitant responsibility to provide access to facilities and equipment, produce extensive operational documentation, and furnish product, packaging, and labeling samples for governmental examination. Federal, state, and local governmental agencies enjoy extensive discretion to determine whether, when and how to conduct these activities. Food companies are therefore vulnerable to unexpected business interruptions and publicity.
All food companies in the United States bear legal responsibility for any violation of applicable food laws or regulations, whether that violation is negligent, non-negligent, or deliberate. Any U.S. company found to have violated food laws or regulations may have its products seized, its operations enjoined, its goods recalled from the market and destroyed, and its business exposed to significant adverse publicity. It is also possible that new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing requirements, might require us to change our compliance policies, incur additional cost, or result in unexpected liabilities that could be significant.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
We maintain a food safety and quality program to verify that the food products supplied to our customers are processed in a safe and sanitary environment and are in compliance with applicable food safety and regulatory requirements and standards. All meat and poultry products that we source are processed in facilities inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or by the equivalent agencies in countries deemed eligible by USDA for exporting meat and poultry to the United States. Accordingly, these products must conform to USDA requirements. All food and packaging suppliers are prequalified and have agreed to comply with our requirements. While we perform supplier inspections and conduct product audits to evaluate suppliers and products for compliance with our company standards and specifications, we may not be able to prevent individual suppliers from failing to comply with food safety laws or our requirements, and we may not be able to locate each failure to comply with food safety laws or our requirements prior to receiving food products. Our customer experience team captures and addresses customer feedback, including inquiries and complaints about the safety and quality of our food products.
Government Regulation of Our Wine Business
The production, sale, and shipment of wine in the United States is regulated by the federal government and by each state government. State laws are not uniform, so business models that are national in scope must account for the state-by-state rules to achieve compliance.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary BAW, Inc., or BAW, is a licensed California winery, and must comply with federal and California law controlling winery operations, and with the laws of each state to which we ship wine. Various regulations control production, excise tax, labeling, alcohol content and recordkeeping. In addition, the promotion and marketing of wine, including pricing, is subject to federal or state regulations. For example, wine marketing cannot be targeted to children, and some states restrict excessive discounts on wine. To assist with federal and state regulatory compliance, BAW relies on various internal and external personnel with relevant experience. 
Alcohol distribution in the United States is traditionally conducted through a “three tier” system, in which alcohol passes from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer in each state, before it can be sold to a consumer. However, applicable state regulations permit manufacturers to ship wine directly to consumers around the country. As a licensed California winery, BAW relies on such regulations to sell and ship wine to the residents of 31 states plus the District of Columbia. Each state permit held by BAW has specific compliance requirements, such as monthly reporting, limits on the amount of wine that can be shipped to a given household, and obtaining an adult signature on delivery.
Human Capital Management
Overview of Human Capital Management
Our human capital management plan is designed to meet the diverse needs of our employee population. Our employee base includes management professionals, engineers, culinary and food safety professionals, fulfillment center employees, and customer service employees in multiple locations across the United States. 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,549 full- and part-time employees, of which a little over 80% were based in our fulfillment centers in Linden, New Jersey, and Richmond, California. From time to time, we also supplement our hourly fulfillment and customer service staffing with temporary personnel.
In addition, on December 8, 2022, to better align internal resources with strategic priorities, we announced a reduction in corporate personnel. This action resulted in a reduction of approximately 10% of our total corporate workforce, inclusive of both then current and vacant roles. 
Expanding and evolving our human capital management plan continues to be at the forefront of how we attract and retain qualified talent. Our people strategy is overseen by our Chief People Officer, our executive and senior leadership team, and senior human resource professionals, and management regularly provides updates to our board of directors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Attraction, Retention, and Development of Talent
Our human capital management strategy is focused on building a culture of accountability, high performance, and inclusion for our employees. We strive to recruit and retain the best people for the job regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other differences. 
In 2022, as a result of an increase in our hourly pay rate to $18.00 per hour in the fourth quarter of 2021, we were able to attract and retain more talent into our fulfillment centers through large-scale onsite hiring events. We continue to work on enhanced attraction and retention opportunities in our fulfillment centers, including a more robust onboarding process and ongoing training programs.
In 2022, we also strengthened our benefits offerings across the company with the introduction of a new 401(k) matching program as of January 1, 2022. We also continue to assess and review all components of our compensation and benefit programs to ensure these programs are competitive and aligned against the markets in which we operate.
Investing in our employee’s growth and development has been and remains a key focus area. In 2022, we implemented multiple programs throughout the year to support those efforts, including:
•Establishing a leadership development program, “At Our Best,” that provided our senior leaders with tools to operate at their best individually and collectively, with inclusion and empathy at the core, and to lead meaningful and sustainable change within the company; 
•Instituting a culture of accountability and implementing best-practice foundations to support better talent planning for our people which is designed to allow us to more effectively and efficiently deliver against our strategy, drive performance and accountability; and
•Introducing new incentive programs in our fulfillment centers to promote awareness around team performance in critical areas, focusing on quality and efficiency and creating a special place to work.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees has been and remains our top priority. We have a dedicated Environmental, Health & Safety, or EHS, team composed of representatives from across the company. The EHS team coordinates health and safety matters at all of our locations, including safety training at our fulfillment centers. Our team regularly evaluates injury rates, safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at our fulfillment centers to enhance worker safety. In addition to this team, we also have a Food Safety and Quality Assurance team which focuses on maintaining good manufacturing practices at our fulfillment centers in accordance with FDA guidance.
In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented new procedures and protocols to minimize the risk to the health and safety of our employees while allowing us to continue to operate our facilities and provide high quality products to our customers on a timely basis. Throughout the pandemic, we were able to continue to service our customers, while at the same time making investments to prioritize the health, safety, and welfare of our employees. We continue to monitor federal, state and local regulations to continue to adapt our health and safety COVID-19 policies in each of our locations. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Initiatives
We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our business experiences. As part of our investment in our people, we strive to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion. We aim to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. By recognizing and celebrating our differences, our goal is to cultivate an inclusive environment representing our core values and mission.
We also demonstrate diversity, equity, and inclusion at the highest levels of our company. As of December 31, 2022, 71% of our executive leadership team identify as female. We are committed to using our reasonable best efforts to maintain gender diversity and increase the racial diversity on our board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, 83.3% of our board of directors identify as female and 50% identify as racially diverse. 
As part of our "Aprons for All" initiative, our internal program for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that we launched in 2020, we created two key councils:
•The Responsible Sourcing Council to help set guidelines and standards for product sourcing, business relationships, and marketing partnerships to align with "Aprons For All"; and
•The Diversity Council to foster an environment that ensures that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunities to succeed and grow at Blue Apron.
