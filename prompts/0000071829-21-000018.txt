Segment Name Change
As part of the Company’s strategic efforts to leverage our core competencies into industrial end-markets and further diversify our revenue streams, we began producing disinfectant and industrial cleaning products in the second quarter of 2020. The ramp-up in production was completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020, which effectively repositioned our chemical blending operation located in Conroe, Texas from primarily supporting the oil and gas fluids markets to fully supporting industrial end-markets. With this transition completed, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the assets and operating results associated with these industrial blending operations have been reported prospectively along with Site and Access Solutions (formerly Mats and Integrated Services) in the newly-defined Industrial Solutions segment.
Industry Fundamentals
Consistent with our long-term strategy as approved by our Board of Directors, the Company has been focused in recent years on expanding our presence in a variety of industrial end-markets, which provide growth opportunities and help reduce our dependency on the volatile E&P industry, as well as improve the stability in cash flow generation and returns on invested capital. However, our Fluids Systems operating results remain dependent on oil and natural gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve and the nature of the drilling operations (including the depth and whether the wells are drilled vertically or horizontally), which governs the revenue potential of each well. Drilling activity levels, in turn, depend on a variety of factors, including oil and natural gas commodity pricing, inventory levels, product demand, and regulatory restrictions. Oil and natural gas prices and activity are cyclical and volatile, and this market volatility has a significant impact on our operating results. In the transition to clean-renewable energy sources, we see an expanding role for geothermal in the coming years, although this application remains a small portion of the global energy market today.
While our Fluids Systems revenue potential is driven by a number of factors including those described above, rig count data remains the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity. The average Baker Hughes Company North American Rig Count was 522 in 2020, compared to 1,077 in 2019, and 1,223 in 2018. During 2019, U.S. rig count steadily 
declined, exiting the year at 805 active rigs, a 26% decline from the end of 2018. During March 2020, oil prices collapsed due to geopolitical events along with the worldwide effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, average U.S. rig count declined 52% in 2020 from 2019. After reaching a low of 244 in mid-August, the U.S. rig count has since increased to 397 as of February 19, 2021. We anticipate that market activity will continue to improve from current levels, although the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and an uncertain economic environment make the timing and pace of recovery difficult to predict.
Outside of North America land markets, drilling activity is generally more stable as this drilling activity is based on longer-term economic projections and multi-year drilling programs, which typically reduces the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity. However, operations in several countries in the EMEA region experienced activity disruptions and project delays beginning in March 2020 and continuing into 2021, driven by government-imposed restrictions on movements of personnel, quarantines of staffing, and logistical limitations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect these disruptions and project delays will continue to impact international activity levels in the near-term, and while we anticipate a general improvement in customer activity during 2021, the impact from the duration and magnitude of the ongoing health pandemic and related government responses are very difficult to predict.
Our Industrial Solutions segment serves a variety of industries, providing temporary worksite access products and services to the electrical transmission & distribution, E&P, pipeline, renewable energy, petrochemical, construction and other industries. The demand for our products and services from customers in these industries is driven, in part, by infrastructure construction and maintenance activity levels in these industries within the United States and the United Kingdom, including required infrastructure investments to support energy transition efforts.
During 2020, demand for worksite access was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers delayed product purchases and planned projects citing COVID-related market uncertainty, permitting delays, and logistical restrictions. During the fourth quarter of 2020, customer activity began to recover and we expect that increased activity for both rental projects and product sales to generally improve in 2021 as COVID-related restrictions on economic activity are lifted and our customers gain confidence in the broader economic recovery. 
Following our 2020 expansion into industrial blending, we provide disinfectants and industrial cleaning products to a variety of industries, and intend to expand our customer base into other industrial markets. We believe that in the wake of COVID-19, the near-term demand for disinfectant and industrial cleaning products will remain stable.
Reportable Segments
Fluids Systems
Our Fluids Systems segment provides drilling, completion, and stimulation fluids products and related technical services to customers primarily in North America and EMEA, as well as certain countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America. We offer customized solutions for highly technical oil, natural gas, and geothermal projects involving complex subsurface conditions such as horizontal, directional, geologically deep, or drilling in deep water. These projects require high levels of monitoring and technical support of the fluids system during the drilling process.
We also have industrial mineral grinding operations for barite, a critical raw material in drilling fluids systems, which serve to support our activities in the North American drilling fluids market. We grind barite and other industrial minerals at four facilities, including locations in Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, and use the resulting products in our drilling fluids systems and also sell the products to third party users, including other drilling fluids companies. In addition, we sell a variety of other minerals, principally to third-party industrial (non-oil and natural gas) markets.
Raw Materials — We believe that our sources of supply for materials and equipment used in our fluids business are adequate for our needs. Our specialty milling operation is our primary supplier of barite used in our North American fluids business. Our mills obtain raw barite ore under supply agreements from foreign sources, primarily China and India. We obtain other materials used in the fluids business from various third-party suppliers. We have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining these raw materials. 
Technology — Proprietary technology and systems, such as our Kronos™ deepwater drilling fluid systems, are an important aspect of our business strategy. We seek patents and licenses on new developments whenever we believe it creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We own patent rights in a family of high-performance water-based fluids systems, which we market as Evolution® and DeepDrill® systems, which are designed to enhance drilling performance while also providing a variety of environmental benefits relative to traditional oil-based fluids. We also rely on a variety of unpatented proprietary technologies and know-how in many of our applications. We believe that our reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements are of equal or greater competitive significance than our existing proprietary rights.
Competition — We face competition from larger companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their fluids systems. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us primarily on price and local relationships. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include a combination of technical proficiency, reputation, price, reliability, quality, breadth of services offered, and experience, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our best-in-class customer experience and value enhancing products and services.
Customers — Our customers are principally major integrated and independent oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. During 2020, approximately 62% of segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers, of which the two largest customers represented 11% and 10%, respectively, of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 57% of its revenues domestically during 2020. In North America, we primarily perform services either under short-term standard contracts or under “master” service agreements. Internationally, some customers issue multi-year contracts, but many are on a well-by-well or project basis. As most agreements with our customers can be terminated upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Industrial Solutions
Our Industrial Solutions segment provides composite matting system rentals utilized for temporary worksite access, along with related site construction and services to customers in various markets including electrical transmission & distribution, E&P, pipeline, renewable energy, petrochemical, construction and other industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. We also sell our manufactured composite mats to customers around the world. In addition, we began leveraging our chemical blending capacity and technical expertise into industrial blending operations, and in response to the increasing market demand for cleaning products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, began producing disinfectants and industrial cleaning products in 2020.
We manufacture our recyclable DURA-BASE® Advanced Composite Mats for use in our rental operations as well as for third-party sales. Our matting systems provide environmental protection and ensure all-weather access to sites with unstable soil conditions. We continue to expand our product offering, which now include the EPZ Grounding System™ for enhanced safety and efficiency for contractors working on power line maintenance and construction projects and the T-REX™ automated mat cleaning system to provide customers with a cost effective and environmentally sensitive system to clean composite mats on site. We continue to make investments in matting and component innovation to deliver further market differentiation, environmental benefits, and competitive advantage to our business.
Raw Materials — The resins, chemicals, and other materials used to manufacture composite mats are widely available. Resin is the largest material component in the manufacturing of our composite mat products. We believe that our sources of supply for materials used in our business are adequate for our needs. We are not dependent upon any one supplier and we have encountered no significant shortages or delays in obtaining any raw materials.
Technology — We have obtained patents related to the design and manufacturing of our recyclable DURA-BASE mats and several of the components, as well as other products and systems related to these mats (including the connecting pins and the EPZ Grounding System™), although certain key patents of the DURA-BASE system expired in May 2020. Using proprietary technology and systems is an important aspect of our business strategy. We believe the lightweight design of our matting system provides a distinct environmental advantage for our customers as compared to alternative wood mat products in the market, by eliminating deforestation required to produce wood mat products and also reducing CO2 emissions associated with product transportation. While we continue to enhance the performance, environmental, and safety benefits of our products and add to our patent portfolio, we believe that our scale and reputation in the industry, the range of services we offer, ongoing technical development and know-how, responsiveness to customers, and understanding of regulatory requirements also have competitive significance in the markets we serve.
Competition — Our market is fragmented and competitive, with many competitors providing various forms of site preparation products and services. The composite mat sales component of our business is not as fragmented as the rental and services components with only a few competitors providing various alternatives to our DURA-BASE composite mat products, such as Signature Systems Group and ISOKON. This is due to many factors, including large capital start-up costs and proprietary technology associated with these products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our businesses include reputation, product capabilities, price, innovation through R&D, and reliability, and that our competitive position is enhanced by our proprietary products, manufacturing expertise, services, and experience.
Customers — Our customers are principally utility companies, infrastructure construction companies, and oil and natural gas E&P companies operating in the markets that we serve. Wood mats and stone continue to be the primary solutions utilized for temporary worksite access across industries, though composite matting solutions continue to gain market share. During 2020, approximately 56% of our segment revenues were derived from the 20 largest segment customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues. The segment also generated 91% of its revenues domestically during 2020. Typically, we perform services either under short-term contracts or rental service agreements. As most agreements with our customers are cancelable upon short notice, our backlog is not significant. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from government contracts.
Human Capital
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for all employees and for those with whom we conduct business. We recognize our greatest assets are our people, and our long-term sustainability depends on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the highly talented individuals that make up the Newpark team, while protecting each other like family and sustaining the environment in which we work. We appreciate our people and their achievements as we recognize they are integral to fully implementing our business strategy, which directly translates to improving our long-term profitability and increasing shareholder value. 
As a global company, the Newpark team supporting our customers spans more than 20 countries, and more than half of our employees reside outside of the United States. Our global footprint provides natural diversity within our organization and serves as a foundation to support an inclusive approach to everything that we do. At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,560 full and part-time personnel, none of which are represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory and through various company-culture initiatives, strive to reinforce our commitment to our Core Values of safety, integrity, respect, excellence, and accountability. The following charts present the geographic composition of our revenues and workforce.
Governmental Regulations
Our business exposes us to regulatory risks associated with the various industries that we serve, including governmental regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general, as well as environmental, health, and safety regulations that have specific application to our business. Our activities are impacted by various federal and state regulatory agencies, and provincial pollution control, health, and safety programs that are administered and enforced by regulatory agencies.
We have implemented various procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and reduce the risk of damage or loss. These include specified handling procedures and guidelines for waste, ongoing employee training, and monitoring, as well as maintaining insurance coverage. We also utilize a corporate-wide health, safety, and environmental management system (“HSEMS”). The HSEMS is designed to capture information related to the planning, decision-making, and general operations of environmental regulatory activities within our operations. We also use the HSEMS to capture the information generated by regularly scheduled independent audits that are performed to validate the findings of our internal monitoring and auditing procedures.
