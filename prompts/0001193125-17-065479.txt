Backlog 
 At December 31, 2016, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products and services was $338 million, compared to $93 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in backlog of $245 million in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily attributed to the Newport Merger, which accounted for $218 million of the increase. The remainder of the increase of $27 million is attributed to an increase in business levels for the Vacuum & Analysis segment in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $316 million of our consolidated backlog was scheduled to be shipped on or before December 31, 2017. In general, we schedule production of our products based upon our customers delivery requirements. Our lead times are very short, as a large portion of our orders are received and shipped within 90 days. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm orders, orders may be subject to cancellation or delay, in many cases, by the customer with limited or no penalty. Our backlog at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual sales which may be generated for any succeeding period. Historically, our backlog levels have fluctuated based upon the ordering patterns of our customers and changes in our manufacturing capacity.
