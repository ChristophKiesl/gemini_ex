TZP Strategies Acquisition Corp. 
 We are a blank check company recently incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. While TZP is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, we currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. 
 While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and manage a business in industries that align with TZP Group’s (“TZP”) focus sectors, including technology services, business services and consumer products and services (collectively our “Focus Sectors”). We aim to partner with owners and management teams seeking an investor with the experience, skills and relationships to enable their business to drive value creation and reach its full potential. Our comparative advantage includes a scaled, operator driven investment platform with broad sourcing capabilities, a well-defined investment process and deep domain knowledge coupled with extensive investing experience across our teams. We employ rigorous and repeatable processes from sourcing and diligence to value creation. We are confident that our disciplined approach will help us both identify strong acquisition candidates and drive long-term value-creation in a business combination. We believe our management team is well-suited to identify opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 
 Our sponsor is an affiliate of TZP, a registered investment adviser. Through our affiliation with TZP, we intend to utilize its broad platform capabilities and leverage the sourcing relationships, industry knowledge and insights and infrastructure of the TZP team. Given TZP’s experience, we believe our management team has the required investment, operational, diligence and capital raising expertise to effect a business combination with an attractive target and to position it for long-term shareholder value creation and success in the public markets. 
 TZP History and Overview 
 TZP manages approximately $2.0 billion of committed and co-investor capital targeting investments in lower and middle market companies with strong growth prospects in our identified Focus Sectors. Samuel Katz founded TZP in 2007 to execute an innovative model of investing in businesses that could benefit from the significant investment and operating expertise of its investment professionals. Historically, these investments have included businesses in coverage areas such as outsourced businesses and IT services, franchise services, tech and tech-enabled services, marketing and media services, travel and leisure, real estate services, consumer and specialty finance. TZP seeks long-term capital appreciation through private equity and equity-related investments in primarily North American businesses. TZP focuses on investments in which existing shareholders and management teams typically retain significant ownership stakes and seek to leverage the platform and value creation capabilities of TZP and its professionals to maximize shareholder value. 
 TZP is differentiated from its lower middle market private equity competitors through its operator driven investment approach that leverages the operating experience and deep domain expertise across its team. TZP has created a unified and proprietary investment platform that generates significant synergies through close coordination of adjacent fund investing strategies. These synergies include broad sourcing capabilities, well- defined investment processes and deep domain knowledge in the Focus Sectors across all investment and operations teams. The firm employs rigorous and repeatable processes that are codified in proprietary sourcing, due diligence, post-close value creation and fund administration playbooks (collectively its “Playbooks”). The TZP Playbooks, which are updated regularly, incorporate best practices identified over TZP’s fifteen- year history to ensure disciplined deployment of capital across various market cycles. These Playbooks create a competitive advantage in utilizing systematic procedures to methodically source, acquire and maximize shareholder value for all TZP investments.

  Business Strategy 
 While we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire and build a company that aligns with TZP’s Focus Sectors and investment criteria. We expect to primarily target tech-enabled businesses with strong secular tailwinds within our broader coverage areas and investment themes. We have particular interest in businesses where our management team or other TZP investing and operating professionals have specific knowledge or experience. We expect to employ a thematic approach to investing that aligns with TZP’s current investment themes, such as, but not limited to, the migration of offline to online for B2B and B2C products and services, outsourcing of non-core business activities, shift of consumer spend to health, wellness, travel and experiences. 
 The opportunity set for SPAC-suitable acquisition targets has expanded considerably with the addition of TZP’s growth equity team in 2019. TZP Strategies Acquisition Corp, is a natural extension of this team’s ability to identify and execute larger transactions. The new growth equity team has already expanded the aperture of proprietary sourcing for high growth and IPO-ready companies and complements TZP’s existing experience in executing growth equity transactions, including several in its portfolio. 
 Our management team has jointly collaborated on a significant number of transactions with enterprise values larger than TZP’s current size criteria, but which would be consistent with the size of a potential acquisition pursued by the Company. For example, Sam Katz and Richard Smith worked together on the acquisitions of Coldwell Banker LLC and PHH Corporation; Sam Katz, Ken Esterow and JoAnne Kruse worked together on the acquisitions of Galileo International, Inc., Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. and Gullivers Travel Associates. We believe this experience will be valuable in identifying acquisition targets and executing on an initial business combination. 
 Our business strategy and investment approach will be further defined by seeking acquisition candidates with one or more of the following characteristics: 
 

• | Favorable macroeconomic or demographic trends
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Well-defined and defensible market niche with meaningful barriers to entry
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary products and services, brand names or channels of distribution
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unrecognized or untapped potential for revenue growth
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Resistance to recessionary pressures due to strong value proposition or significant recurring revenue
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunity to recruit and add talent from TZP’s network
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Identified business development, sales strategy opportunities, or prospects for cross-selling within the target
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identified growth investments in technology infrastructure
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong cash flow characteristics with low capital intensity and attractive free cash flow conversion, and high operating leverage
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong core management team with potential for augmenting and upgrading
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential opportunities for add-on, accretive acquisitions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies that will be well-perceived by public shareholders
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

  Our business strategy will be augmented by the TZP platform, including the following benefits: 
 

• | Established Brand and Reputation. Advantaged credibility with sellers, management teams, intermediaries, lenders and service providers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public Company Experience. Multiple partners with public company operating and acquisition experience, including decades of experience in working together and driving shareholder value creation
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Structured Investment Processes. Well-defined processes with adherence to core principals, application of third generation Playbooks and culture of continuous improvement
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deal Sourcing. Access to proprietary deal flow with a deal sourcing engine focused on growth companies and driven by deep industry expertise and coverage across our investment and operating team
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Domain Knowledge: Firm-wide cross-pollination of industry vertical knowledge and expertise, including the experience of our management team and our network of executives
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational Expertise: Full-time Portfolio Operations Group and executive network with experience driving value creation in public companies and with private equity backed businesses
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Human Capital Development: Core competency in attracting, developing and retaining top management talent, including through our external network of senior advisors and other provider partnerships
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administrative Infrastructure: Robust finance, compliance and administrative capabilities that are capable of supporting public company needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Values-Based Organization: Commitment to Code of Values which shapes TZP’s culture and guides its interactions with employees, portfolio company executives, investors, intermediaries and service providers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Although we believe our affiliation with TZP allows us to benefit from its platform in the aforementioned ways, we do not have any agreements, arrangements or understandings with TZP, whether oral or written, to provide us with the foregoing benefits. 
 Acquisition Criteria 
 We have an existing pipeline of available opportunities due to unutilized sources of internally developed, quality targets where TZP has a competitive advantage. TZP Strategies Acquisition Corp, is an organic and logical extension of TZP’s existing platform and will allow us to pursue acquisition candidates from TZP’s sourcing efforts that do not align with TZP’s existing investing strategies due to size, portfolio construction or deal structure. Additionally, the synergy of deal flow, knowledge sharing, and available resources is expected to enhance our investment sourcing process. 
 We plan to focus on growth-oriented and/or non-control acquisitions, including target companies seeking a public market alternative and primary capital for growth investments, by leveraging TZP’s existing deal flow, vertical expertise and extensive executive networks. We have proven experience executing on growth equity and non-control transactions, which positions us well in identifying a strong acquisition target. This expertise is demonstrated through seven prior or current examples of growth and/or non-control deals within the TZP portfolio, including Xero Shoes, Evergent, Vegas.com, Saatva, The Black Tux, AvVenta and BQ Resorts. 
 Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe: 
 

• | will benefit from TZP’s well established Playbooks, which can drive efficiencies and post-closing value creation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9 

  
• | will benefit from TZP partners’ hands-on operating and public company experience;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will benefit from disciplined process, measurement and constant improvement, which are core principles of our operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will benefit from TZP’s structured processes to generate continuous improvement via proprietary Playbooks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. In order to ensure a thorough and rigorous review of a prospective target business, we will utilize TZP’s proprietary diligence Playbooks, which include comprehensive procedures that guide each phase of our due diligence process. 
 Our due diligence process will start with organizing a deal team of experienced investment professionals to interact with the business target and execute on each phase of the diligence Playbook. Our team will review all available information regarding the target business, its management team and the broader industry landscape to develop conviction in the attractiveness of the investment opportunity and validation of the investment thesis. Furthermore, our team will create a list of critical diligence considerations, each of which will need to be addressed prior to consummating a transaction, to help guide our process. Our team will also establish a formal check-in date to evaluate progress against our critical diligence considerations and evaluate our conviction in the opportunity before proceeding to third-party diligence. Along with our own intensive financial and business due diligence, we will engage a variety of highly experienced third-party accountants, consultants and industry experts to supplement our investigation into the business target. We will utilize a disciplined check-in process, marked by distinct diligence milestones, to ensure efficiency in the use of time and expenses throughout the due diligence review. As a part of the final due diligence stage, we will create an investment memorandum memorializing (i) a summary of the key terms of the proposed transaction; (ii) validation of our conviction and investment thesis; (iii) all findings from the due diligence process; (iv) final capital structure; and (v) expected investment returns under a variety of scenarios. Ultimately, our management team will review the final due diligence findings along with the investment memorandum to confirm that the investment opportunity fulfills our investment criteria. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or an independent accounting firm. 
 Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
10 

  Initial Business Combination 
 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (net of amounts previously disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 We may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with one or more parties affiliated with TZP, including without limitation, officers and partners of TZP, investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by affiliates of TZP and/or investors in funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by affiliates of TZP. Any such party may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a specified future issuance. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such joint acquisition or specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital share of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post¬ transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 
11 

  The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Other Considerations 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with TZP or our sponsor, Founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with TZP, our sponsor or any of our Founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. While TZP is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, we currently do not have any specific business combination under consideration. 
 TZP manages multiple investment vehicles, and may raise additional funds and/or accounts in the future, which may be during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. These TZP investment entities may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity. 
 In addition, certain of our Founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by TZP or its affiliates and certain companies in which TZP or such entities have invested. As a result, if any of our Founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any TZP funds or other investment vehicles), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these funds or investment entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to TZP or our Founders may be suitable for both us and a current or future TZP fund, portfolio company or other investment entity and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties, will first be directed to such fund, portfolio company or other entity before being directed, if at all, to us. None of TZP, our Founders or any members of our board of directors who are also employed by TZP or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or executives of TZP. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. 
 
12 

  Our Founders and our directors and officers, TZP, or its affiliates may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates and the director and officer teams. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 In addition, our Founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our Founders, officers and directors have and will have in the future time and attention requirements for current and future investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by TZP or its affiliates. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, investments funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by TZP or its affiliates (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of our Founders, officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities), TZP and its affiliates will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. 
 Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 7 Times Square, Suite 4307, New York, NY 10036, and our telephone number is (212) 398-0300. We maintain a corporate website at tzpgroup.com/tzpspac. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and expect to receive, after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 
13 

  We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
