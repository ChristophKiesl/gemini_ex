G T International, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc., existing as a Wyoming corporation. Not all subsidiaries are currently active.
 
On December 31, 2012, Global Tech and its new subsidiary, TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, signed a binding asset purchase agreement with American Resource Technologies, Inc. (“ARUR”), a Kansas corporation, to acquire all the assets of ARUR for a purchase price of $513,538, which was paid in the form of 4,668,530 shares of Global Tech’s common stock as described in the asset purchase agreement. The shares were valued at $0.11 per share, based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the Closing Date. The assets purchased from ARUR include a 75% working interest in oil and gas leases in Kansas, as well as other oil field assets, a natural gas pipeline, currently shut down that is also located in Kansas, 25% interest in three other business entities operating in Kansas, and accounts receivables from two companies operating in Brazil in the amounts of $3,600,000 and $3,600,000 respectively. TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. also purchased three promissory notes in the amounts of $100,000, $100,000 and $350,000, as well an overdue contract for revenue in the amount of $1,000,000. Finally, a gun sight patent was also acquired from Century Technologies, Inc. All accounts and notes receivable were deemed uncollectable due to the age and circumstances, and therefore were assessed no value in the asset purchase. The equity ownerships were also deemed to be impaired due to the inactive nature of the entities, and were not allocated any value. The gun sight patent was also not readily assessable as to value and no purchase price was allocated to this asset. Also, due to the mechanic’s lien and lawsuit on the oil leases, as well as the absence of an official reserve report, the oil lease was also impaired and no value was recorded for this asset. On September 2015, the Chautauqua County Court decided that American Resource Technologies Inc management and Board of Directors improperly acted and rendered the original Agreement a nullity. During 2019, the Company removed additional obligations related to the ARUR acquisition and settled legal fees due. During the 2nd quarter 2020, the Company was successful in recalling the 4,668,530 shares and cancelling them from the shareholders list.

On December 30, 2016, Global Tech Industries Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, executed a stock purchase agreement (the “Agreement”), which was signed and closed in Hong Kong, with GoFun Group, Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary Go F & B Holdings, Ltd. GoFun Group, Ltd. is a privately held company running a casual dining restaurant business, based in Hong Kong. Subsequent to the agreement being signed, GoFun Group failed to substantially perform under the agreement, including, but not limited to providing audited financials of its assets, making the ongoing payments called for in the agreement, along with other matters that led Global Tech to initiate litigation in the United States. Currently, Global Tech and GoFun are litigating the matter in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York, Docket No.17-CV-03727.  On October 2, 2019, the Company was able to secure, via preliminary settlement, the return of 43,649,491 shares of the Company’s stock, that was issued in good faith to GoFun in anticipation of a final stock exchange. The stock has since been returned to the Company’s treasury and cancelled. As of this writing, motions are pending that may require remaining negotiations to continue in arbitration.
 
On December 30, 2019, a dispute between the Company and its counsel regarding the GoFun matter, above, resulted in a filing, and subsequent settlement, of an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York (Index No. 656396/2019). Pursuant to the settlement, counsel for the company accepted previously-issued shares as full payment for all legal work, expenses, costs, and other fees.
 
Research and Development
 
Although Global Tech’s staff is limited, it continues to monitor new developments and any emerging technologies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
With the acquisition of BAT, Global Tech acquired fifteen (15) intellectual properties pertaining to the construction of the mobile configuration and operation of the glyd-arc medical waste destruction unit, as well as an enhanced configuration and novel method for coal gasification.
 
There is currently no use or activity involving the intellectual properties of the Company, and accordingly, there is no recorded value assigned to these assets.
 
Government Regulation
 
BAT
 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), no registration of the BAT system is required because the waste destruction process does not involve incineration. Incineration processes are subject to regulation by the EPA. However, any hazardous waste destruction system that is constructed will be subject to the state laws and regulations where the system is located, as well as any regulations pertaining to the storage, transporting and/or destroying hazardous waste. BAT is also subject to government laws and regulations governing health, safety, working conditions, employee relations, wrongful termination, wages, taxes and other matters applicable to businesses in general. The Company currently has no plans to manufacture, sell, or use any BAT-related systems.
