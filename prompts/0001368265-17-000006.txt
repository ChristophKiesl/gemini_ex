Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets in the United States and Canada, based on the number of stations operated and the amount of gasoline gallon equivalents ("GGEs") of CNG, LNG and RNG delivered. 
Our principal business is supplying CNG, LNG and RNG (which can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG) for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and providing operation and maintenance ("O&M") services for natural gas fueling stations. As a comprehensive solution provider, we also: design, build, operate and maintain fueling stations; manufacture, sell and service non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations and LNG stations; offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets; transport and sell CNG and LNG to industrial and institutional energy users who do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines; sell RNG; sell tradable credits we generate by selling natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel, including LCFS Credits and RIN Credits; help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles; and obtain federal, state and local credits, grants and incentives.
We serve fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, government fleets, and industrial and institutional energy users. We believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for natural gas vehicle fuel for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, we serve nearly 1,000 fleet customers operating over 45,000 natural gas vehicles and we own, operate or supply over 570 natural gas fueling stations in 42 states in the United States and four provinces in Canada.
Market for Natural Gas as an Alternative Vehicle Fuel
As of December 31, 2016, Natural Gas Vehicles for America ("NGV America") estimates that there were approximately 1,750 natural gas fueling stations in the United States and about 153,000 natural gas vehicles on American roads, including 39,500 heavy-duty vehicles (e.g. tractors, refuse trucks and buses), 25,800 medium-duty vehicles (e.g. delivery vans and shuttles) and 87,000 light-duty vehicles (e.g. passenger cars, small utility vehicles, trucks and vans).
We believe that natural gas is an attractive alternative to gasoline and diesel for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States because it is plentiful, domestically produced, cleaner and typically cheaper than gasoline or diesel. Historically, oil, gasoline and diesel prices have been highly volatile, while natural gas prices have generally been stable and lower than the cost of oil, gasoline and diesel on an energy equivalent basis. Additionally, we expect increasingly stringent federal, state and local air quality regulations, additional regulations mandating low carbon fuels and expanding initiatives by fleet operators to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel diversity, all of which may increase market adoption of natural gas as an alternative to gasoline and diesel as a vehicle fuel. We believe these factors may encourage the development of an opportunity to market natural gas as a vehicle fuel in the United States.
Benefits of Natural Gas Fuel
Domestic and Plentiful Supply.    Technological advances in natural gas drilling and production, including the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques and the use of hydraulic fracturing, have unlocked vast natural gas reserves. The United States produces the highest volume of natural gas in the world, with proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas. 
Less Expensive.    Due to the abundance of natural gas, the cost of natural gas in the United States is less than the cost of crude oil, on an energy equivalent basis. Based on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, we believe that natural gas will remain cheaper than gasoline and diesel for the foreseeable future. In addition, because the price of the natural gas commodity makes up a smaller portion of the cost of a GGE of CNG or LNG relative to the commodity portion of the cost of a GGE of diesel or gasoline, the price of a GGE of CNG or LNG is less sensitive to increases in the underlying commodity cost.
Cleaner.    Natural gas contains less carbon than any other fossil fuel and thus produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned.  The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has concluded that a natural gas vehicle emits fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle on a well-to-wheel basis. Additionally, a study from Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, indicates that natural gas vehicles produce at least 13% to 21% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles.  
For natural gas vehicles that run on RNG, we estimate, based on CARB data, that the greenhouse gas emissions produced are from 50% to 125% less than comparable gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, depending on the source of biogas. We believe 
4

the RNG we sell for use as a vehicle fuel, which is distributed under the brand name Redeem™, is the first commercially available RNG vehicle fuel made from organic waste.
Safer.    As reported by NGV America, CNG and LNG are relatively safer than gasoline and diesel because they dissipate into the air when spilled or in the event of a vehicle accident. When released, CNG and LNG are also less combustible than gasoline or diesel because they ignite only at relatively high temperatures. The fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas vehicles are subjected to a number of federally required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressure and crash testing, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Additionally, CNG and LNG are stored in above-ground tanks and therefore will not contaminate soil or groundwater in the event of a spill or leak. 
Natural Gas Vehicles
Natural gas vehicles use internal combustion engines similar to those used in gasoline or diesel powered vehicles and the acceleration and other performance characteristics of natural gas vehicles are similar to those of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles of the same weight and engine class. Additionally, natural gas vehicles, whether they run on CNG or LNG, are refueled using a hose and nozzle that makes an airtight seal with the vehicle's gas tank.
Natural gas vehicles have engines specially tuned to run on natural gas fuels, which have higher octane content than gasoline or diesel, and fuel tanks and lines specially designed to hold CNG and LNG and deliver it to the vehicle’s engine. These special features, including primarily the fuel tanks that hold CNG and LNG, cause natural gas vehicles to typically cost more than gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles. Additionally, for heavy-duty vehicles, spark ignited natural gas vehicles generally operate more quietly than diesel-powered vehicles.
Virtually any car, truck, bus or other vehicle is capable of being manufactured or modified to run on natural gas. Many models of heavy-, medium- and light- duty natural gas vehicles and engines are available in the United States and Canada. These vehicles include long-haul tractors, refuse trucks, regional tractors, transit buses, ready-mix trucks, delivery trucks, vocational work trucks, school buses, shuttles, passenger sedans, pickup trucks and cargo and passenger vans. We expect that additional models and types of natural gas vehicles will become available if natural gas is increasingly adopted as a vehicle fuel in the United States.
Products, Services and Other Business Activities
CNG Sales.    CNG is natural gas that is compressed and dispensed in gaseous form. We typically deliver CNG by obtaining natural gas from local utilities or third-party marketers and then compressing, storing and dispensing it into our customers' vehicles. Some of the natural gas we obtain from third parties for CNG sales is purchased under take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas.
We sell CNG for use as a vehicle fuel through fueling stations located on our customers' properties and through our network of public access fueling stations. Our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made primarily through contracts with our customers. Under these contracts, pricing is principally determined on an index-plus basis, which is calculated by adding a margin and delivery cost to the local index or utility price for natural gas. As a result, CNG vehicle fuel sales determined by an index-plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas which includes transportation charges, utilities, and other fees. The remainder of our CNG vehicle fuel sales are on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access stations based on prevailing market conditions.
Our subsidiary, NG Advantage also sells CNG for non-vehicle purposes. NG Advantage uses a fleet of 70 high-capacity tube trailers to deliver CNG to institutions and industrial energy users, such as hospitals, food processors, manufacturers and paper mills that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines. Utilizing its trailer fleet, NG Advantage creates a "virtual natural gas pipeline" that allows oil, diesel or propane users to take advantage of the cost savings and environmental benefits of natural gas. We anticipate that NG Advantage will need to purchase or lease additional trailers in the future to transport CNG in support of its operations.
LNG Production and Sales.    LNG is natural gas that is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260 degrees Fahrenheit until it condenses into a liquid. We obtain LNG from our own liquefaction plants and from third party suppliers. We own and operate LNG liquefaction plants near Houston, Texas and Boron, California, which we call the "Pickens Plant" and the "Boron Plant," respectively. The Pickens Plant has the capacity to produce 35 million gallons of LNG per year and includes a tanker trailer loading system and a 1.0 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 840,000 usable gallons. The Boron Plant is capable of producing 60 million gallons of LNG per year and has a dual tanker trailer loading system and a 1.8 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 1.5 million usable gallons. In 2016, we purchased 44% of our LNG from third-party suppliers and we produced the remainder of our LNG at the Pickens Plant and the Boron Plant. Some natural gas we obtain from third-parties for LNG sales is purchased under “take or pay” contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas.
5

We sell LNG for use as a vehicle fuel on a bulk basis to fleet customers, who often own and operate their fueling stations, and through our network of public access fueling stations. We deliver LNG via our fleet of 84 tanker trailers to fueling stations, where it is stored and then dispensed in liquid form into vehicles. We contract with third parties to provide tractors and drivers. The need to liquefy and transport LNG generally causes LNG to cost more than CNG. We sell LNG through supply contracts that are priced on an index-plus basis, such that LNG sales under these contracts increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas. We also sell LNG vehicle fuel on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access stations based on prevailing market conditions. Additionally, we sell LNG for non-vehicle purposes, including to customers who use LNG in oil fields, and for industrial, utility, marine and rail applications.
O&M Services.   We perform O&M services for CNG and LNG fueling stations that we do not own. For these services, we generally charge a fixed or a per-gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station. We have an operations team performing preventive maintenance and available to respond to service requests.
VETC. Under separate pieces of U.S. federal legislation from October 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015, we were eligible to receive a federal alternative fuels tax credit (“VETC”) of $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as vehicle fuel. From January 1, 2016, the new credit was the same as the credit it replaced, except that the credit for LNG sold as a vehicle fuel in 2016 was based on the diesel gallon equivalent of LNG sold rather than the liquid gallon of LNG sold. Based on the service relationship with our customers, either we or our customers claimed the credit. VETC ceased to be available after it expired on December 31, 2016, and it may not be available for any subsequent period. 
Station Construction and Engineering.    We design and construct fueling stations and facility modifications and sell or lease some of these stations to our customers. We charge construction or other fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project. 
Since 2008, we have served as general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors to build 416 natural gas fueling stations. We acquired the additional stations that we own but did not build through acquisitions of assets or businesses. We use a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build fueling stations. Equipment for a CNG station typically consists of dryers, compressors (including those manufactured by Clean Energy Compression), dispensers and storage tanks. Equipment for a LNG station typically consists of storage tanks and dispensing equipment. Many of our fueling stations have separate public access areas for retail customers, which generally have the look, feel and dispensing rates of gasoline and diesel fueling stations.
We also offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets. For example, our NGV Easy Bay™ product is a natural gas vapor leak barrier developed specifically for natural gas vehicle facilities. 
RNG Production and Sales.    RNG is produced from waste streams such as landfills, animal waste digesters and waste water treatment plants. RNG production plants are connected to natural gas pipelines, which allow RNG to be transported to vehicle fueling stations where it can be compressed and dispensed as CNG, and to LNG liquefaction facilities where it is converted to LNG.
We obtain RNG through our own production plants as well as through third-party producers. Our subsidiary, Renewables, currently owns RNG production facilities located at Republic Services landfills in Canton, Michigan and North Shelby, Tennessee, and has entered into long-term fixed-price sale contracts for the majority of the RNG that we expect these facilities to produce over the next seven years. Additionally, we have sought to expand our RNG business by pursuing additional RNG production projects, either on our own or with project partners. For instance, Renewables, entered into agreements to form joint ventures with Aria Energy Operating LLC, a developer of RNG production facilities, to develop RNG production facilities at a Republic Services landfill in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and an Advanced Disposal landfill near Atlanta, Georgia.
We sell some of the RNG we produce through our natural gas fueling infrastructure for use as a vehicle fuel. In addition, we purchase RNG from third party producers and sell that RNG for vehicle fuel use through our fueling infrastructure. The RNG we sell for vehicle fuel is distributed under the name Redeem™.
In February 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to our existing RNG production business, including our two existing RNG production facilities and our interest in the two new RNG production facilities in development. We expect this sale to close on or before March 31, 2017, and thereafter we will continue to procure and sell RNG as Redeem.
Sales of RINs and LCFS Credits.   We generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon, and we generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emissions requirements. Generally, the amount of RINs and LCFS Credits we generate increases as we sell higher volumes of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, but the amount of these credits that we sell and our revenue from these sales can vary depending on the market 
6

for these credits, which has historically been volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations, and changes to applicable regulations.
Natural Gas Fueling Compressors.    Our subsidiary Clean Energy Compression manufactures, sells and services non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market. Clean Energy Compression is headquartered near Vancouver, British Columbia, has an additional manufacturing facility near Shanghai, China, and has sales and service offices in the United States, Bangladesh, Colombia and Peru. Clean Energy Compression enables us to satisfy our internal compressor needs since compressors are the most important piece of equipment for a CNG station. Clean Energy Compression also allows us to offer a high-quality and price competitive "equipment only" solution for customers who do not want our full suite of engineering and construction services.
Vehicle Acquisition and Finance.    We offer vehicle finance services, including loans and leases, to help our customers acquire natural gas vehicles. As appropriate, we apply for and receive federal, state and local incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers. We may also secure vehicles to place with customers and/or pay deposits with respect to these vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers, which we may be required to purchase if our customers fail to purchase the vehicle as anticipated.
Sales and Marketing
We have sales representatives covering all of our major operating territories, including the United States, Canada, China, Peru, Columbia, Mexico and Europe. 
We market primarily through our direct sales force, attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our sales and marketing group also works closely with federal, state and local government agencies to provide education on the value of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry.
Key Markets and Customers
We serve customers in a variety of markets, such as trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users and government fleets. We believe these customers markets are well-suited for the adoption of natural gas vehicle fuel because they use relatively high volumes of fuel, can be served by a fueling infrastructure that is centralized or along well-defined routes and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental regulations.
Trucking. We believe that heavy-duty trucking represents one of the greatest opportunities for natural gas to be used as a vehicle fuel in the United States, and as of December 31, 2016 we fuel over 3,000 heavy-duty trucks. Because these high-mileage vehicles consume substantial amounts of fuel, they can derive significant benefits from the lower cost of natural gas. Many well-known shippers, manufacturers, retailers and other truck fleet operators have started to adopt natural gas fueled trucks to move their freight. Such companies include Honda, Frito-Lay, FedEx, Anheuser-Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, Johnson & Johnson, The Home Depot, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Costco Wholesale, Lowes, Pepsi, UPS, MillerCoors, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Kraft, Kroger, P&G, Hertz and Owens Corning. 
To help facilitate the transition of trucking fleets to natural gas, we have negotiated favorable CNG and LNG tank pricing from manufacturers, which we are passing along to our customers, and we've built America's Natural Gas Highway. Many existing ANGH stations are located at Pilot Flying J Travel Centers, one of the largest truck fueling operators in the United States. Building ANGH has required, and may continue to require, a commitment of capital and other resources. For instance, most of our ANGH stations were initially built to provide LNG, which costs more than CNG on an energy equivalent basis, and we have been spending, and expect to continue to spend, additional capital to add CNG fueling capability to many of our ANGH stations. 
Airports. We estimate that vehicles serving airports in the United States, including airport delivery fleets, rental car and parking passenger shuttles and taxis, consume an aggregate of approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. Additionally, many U.S. airports face emissions challenges and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce pollution, particularly as part of any expansion plans. As a result, many of these airports have adopted various strategies to address tailpipe emissions, including rental car and hotel shuttle consolidation, and requiring or encouraging service vehicle operators to switch their fleets to natural gas. To assist in this effort, airports are contracting with service providers to design, build and operate natural gas fueling stations in strategic locations on their properties. 
We serve customers at 39 airports, including Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International, Baltimore Washington International, Dallas-Ft. Worth International, Denver International, Dulles International, George Bush International, Las Vegas, Logan International, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International, Los Angeles International, Newark International, Oakland International, Orlando, Phoenix Sky Harbor International, San Francisco International, San Diego International, SeaTac International (Seattle) and Tampa, International.

Refuse. According to INFORM, there are nearly 200,000 refuse trucks in the United States that collect and haul refuse and recyclables, which collectively consume approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. We estimate that approximately 55% of new refuse trucks in 2016 operate on natural gas, up from approximately 3% of new refuse trucks in 2008. Refuse haulers are increasingly adopting trucks that run on CNG to realize operating savings and to address their customers' demands for reduced emissions. 
We fuel over 10,000 refuse vehicles for customers including Waste Management and Republic Services, as well as other waste haulers such as Atlas Disposal, Burrtec, Recology, South San Francisco Scavenger, Waste Connections and Waste Pro, among others. We also provide vehicle fueling services to municipal refuse fleets, including fleets in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and New York City, among other locations. 
Transit Agencies. According to the American Public Transportation Association, there are over 71,000 municipal transit buses operating in the United States. In many areas increasingly stringent emissions standards have limited the fueling options available to public transit operators. Also, transit agencies typically fuel at a central location and use high volumes of fuel. We estimate that transit agencies in the United States consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. Many transit agencies have been early adopters of natural gas vehicles, and over 25% of existing transit buses and over 35% of new transit buses operate on natural gas. 
We fuel close to 9,000 transit vehicles and our U.S. public transit customers include the following: Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, Foothill Transit, Orange County Transit Authority, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, Dallas Area Rapid Transit Phoenix Transit, Jacksonville Transportation Authority, NICE Bus and Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority. We also serve public transit customers in British Columbia.
Industrial and Institutional Customers. See "Business - Products, Services and Other Business Activities" above for a description of industrial and institutional customers we supply with CNG and LNG.
Government Fleets. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, approximately 18%, 18% and 16% of our revenue, respectively, were derived from contracts with government entities such as municipal transit fleets. As government regulations on pollution continue to become more stringent, government agencies are evaluating ways to make their fleets cleaner and run more economically. 
Our representative government fleet customers include the California Department of Transportation, State of New York, State of Colorado, City of New York, City of Denver, City and County of Los Angeles, City of Newport Beach, South Coast Air Quality Management District, City and County of San Francisco, City of Oakland, City and County of Dallas, City of Phoenix, The University of California, and Oklahoma State University.
Grant Programs
We apply for and help our fleet customers apply for federal, state and local grant programs in areas where we operate. These programs provide funding for natural gas vehicle conversions and purchases, natural gas fueling station construction and natural gas vehicle fuel sales.
Competition
The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. We believe the biggest competition for CNG and LNG is gasoline and diesel, as the vast majority of vehicles in the United States and Canada are powered by gasoline and diesel. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and other alternative fueling stations. Further, for certain of our key customer markets, such as airports and public transit, we indirectly compete with companies such as Uber and Lyft that provide alternative transportation methods.
A significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station operators, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or may enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration and substantially greater financial, marketing, research, and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences or legal requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market. Additionally, utilities and their affiliates typically have additional and unique competitive advantages, including a lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness and large and well-trained sales and marketing organizations.
8

 We believe we have approximately 75 competitors in the market for natural gas vehicle fuels, including:

• | Providers of CNG fuel infrastructure and fueling services, including Love's Trillium, Gain Clean Fuels, TruStar Energy, AmpCNG and EVO CNG, ;


• | Fuel station owners, such as Kwik Trip, a company that owns CNG fueling stations in the Midwestern United States;


• | Shell Oil Products U.S., which operates LNG fueling stations;


• | Applied LNG Technology, Stabilis and Prometheus Energy, each of which distributes LNG; and


• | Utilities and their affiliates in several states, including California, Utah, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina and Washington, which own and operate public access CNG stations that compete with our stations. In addition, utilities are seeking approval from the California Public Utilities Commission to spend approximately $1.0 billion on electric vehicle charging infrastructure for trucks, buses and other vehicles which infrastructure, if built, would compete with our stations. 

We also manufacture and sell CNG fueling equipment through Clean Energy Compression. The market for CNG fueling equipment is highly competitive and our competitors in this market include Aspro, GNC Galileo, GE, SAFE, ANGI Energy Systems, and Atlas Copco. Numerous other equipment or compressor manufacturing companies may also enter this market in the future. We also compete with many third parties for the rights to develop RNG production facilities, the rights to acquire RNG from third party producers and for customers to purchase the RNG that we sell. In addition, we sell CNG to industrial and institutional energy users through NG Advantage and compete with other participants in this highly competitive market, including Xpress Natural Gas, OsComp Systems and Irving Ltd.
We compete for vehicle fuel users based on demand for the type of fuel, which may be affected by such factors as fuel cost, supply and availability, cost and availability of vehicles, convenience and accessibility of fueling stations, the quality, cleanliness and safety of the fuel, and brand recognition. As of December 31, 2016, we owned, operated or supplied over 570 CNG and LNG fueling stations, which we estimate is approximately four times the number of CNG fueling stations operated by our next largest competitor. We believe we are the only company in the United States or Canada that provides both CNG and LNG vehicle fuel on a significant scale, and our natural gas fueling operations cover more states and provinces than any of our competitors. 
We expect competition to increase in the alternative fuel markets generally and, if the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, the market for natural gas fuel. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Certain aspects of our operations are subject to regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws. Further, if we were to violate these laws or if the laws were to change, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect our operations are described below. We believe we are in material compliance with these and other regulatory requirements known to apply to our business. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date, but new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations to make them more stringent, such as more rigorous air emissions requirements or increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to undertake significant capital expenditures in the future.
CNG and LNG Stations. To construct a CNG or LNG fueling station, we must satisfy permitting and other requirements and either we or a third party contractor must be licensed as a general engineering contractor. Each CNG and LNG fueling station must be constructed in accordance with federal, state and local regulations pertaining to station design, environmental health, accidental release prevention, above-ground storage tanks and hazardous waste and other materials. We are also required to register with certain state agencies as a retailer/wholesaler of CNG and LNG.
Transfer of LNG. Federal safety standards require each transfer of LNG to be conducted in accordance with specific written safety procedures. These procedures must be located at each transfer location and must require that qualified personnel be in attendance during all LNG transfer operations.
LNG Liquefaction Plants. To build and operate LNG liquefaction plants, we must apply for facility permits or licenses that address many factors, including storm water and wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions related to production activities or equipment operations. The construction of LNG plants must also be approved by local planning boards and fire departments.
Financing. State agencies generally require the registration of finance lenders. For example, in California, pursuant to the California Finance Lenders Law, one of our subsidiaries is required to be registered as a finance lender with the California Department of Corporations.

Natural Gas Fueling Compressors. Our manufacturing facility for natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment is located in Canada and is registered with the British Columbia Safety Authority and the Society of Mechanical Engineers for manufacturing and operating pressure vessels. Additionally, CNG fueling equipment is manufactured to meet the electrical and mechanical design standards of the country where the equipment will be installed. 
RNG. RNG production facilities are required to comply with Title V of the Clean Air Act. In addition, RNG projects must produce RNG that meets the gas quality specifications of the local utilities that accept the gas. These specifications are approved by the applicable state utilities commission. 
RIN Credits. In February 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") finalized the RFS (which was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992/2005), which creates RINs that can be generated by the production and use of RNG in the transportation sector and can be sold to fuel providers that are not compliant under the RFS.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. California has adopted laws requiring statewide reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. As of January 1, 2015, California's AB 32 law began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including the emissions associated with LNG and CNG vehicle fuel. 
Under AB 32, the LNG vehicle fuel provider is the regulated party with respect to LNG vehicle fuel use. We will incur costs to comply with AB 32 based on how much LNG vehicle fuel we sell that is regulated, CARB's guidance on the regulation of LNG vehicle fuel, potential regulatory changes and the cost of carbon credits under AB 32. We anticipate that we will pass the costs we incur to comply with this law through to our LNG customers. With respect to CNG, the regulated party under AB 32 is the utility that owns the pipe through which the fossil fuel natural gas is sold.  We anticipate that, over time, as the utilities' compliance costs increase, we or, to the extent we pass these costs through to our customers, our CNG customers will be required to pay more for CNG vehicle fuel to cover the increased AB 32 compliance costs of the utility. The amount of these costs that we or our CNG customers will be required to pay will be determined by the amount the utility spends to buy any carbon credits needed to comply with AB 32 and the amount of natural gas we or our customers buy through a utility’s pipeline. 
Although our Redeem™ RNG vehicle fuel may qualify for an exemption from AB 32 when sold as LNG or CNG, the availability of any such exemption is uncertain at this time due to the complexity of the requirements that must be met in order to qualify for such an exemption and the possibility of changes to the law. Any Redeem™ volumes that are not exempt would incur compliance costs commensurate with sales of CNG and LNG derived from fossil fuel natural gas. 
To help achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions for mobile sources that are mandated by AB 32, CARB approved the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which encourages low carbon "compliant" transportation fuels (including CNG, LNG and RNG) in the marketplace by allowing producers of these fuels to generate LCFS Credits that can be sold to noncompliant regulated parties.
The federal and other state governments are also considering measures to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any of these regulations, if and when implemented, may regulate the greenhouse gas emissions produced by or associated with our LNG production plants, our CNG and LNG fueling stations, our existing RNG production facilities (which we expect to sell on or before March 31, 2017, as described under "- Products, Services and Other Business Activities - RNG Production and Sales" above) or the CNG, LNG and RNG we sell, and could require us to obtain emissions credits or invest in costly emissions prevention technology. We cannot estimate the potential costs associated with compliance with potential federal, state or local regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 832 people. We have not experienced any work stoppages and none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in one reportable segment. For information about our revenue, operating income (loss) and long-lived assets in different geographic areas, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We are subject to certain risks attendant to our foreign operations, which are described below in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Corporate Information; Acquisitions and Divestitures
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2001. We have completed, and we anticipate continuing to pursue, acquisitions, investments, divestitures, joint ventures and other partnerships as we become aware of opportunities that 
10

we believe can increase our competitive advantages, expand our product offerings, take advantage of industry developments, enhance our market position or provide other benefits, including streamlining operations and reducing our costs. Recent significant transactions of this nature include: our acquisition of the manufacturing and servicing business of Clean Energy Compression in September 2010; our sale of our former natural gas vehicle conversion business in June 2013; our acquisition of a controlling interest in NG Advantage in October 2014; our sale of our interest in a RNG production facility in Dallas, Texas in December 2014; and our proposed sale of the assets related to our RNG production business, which we expect to occur on or before March 31, 2017.
