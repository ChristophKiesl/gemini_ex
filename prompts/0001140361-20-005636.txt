--------+---------

General
 
Dime Community Bancshares, Inc. (the “Holding Company” and together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation organized by Dime Community Bank (the “Bank”) for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of the Bank issued in the Bank’s conversion to stock ownership on June 26, 1996. On January 24, 2019, the Bank filed an application with the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”) seeking approval to convert from a New York stock form savings bank to a New York commercial bank (the “Charter Conversion”).  Simultaneous with the Charter Conversion application to NYSDFS, the Company filed an application with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to delist as a savings and loan holding company and elect to become a bank holding company.  Having received all applicable regulatory approvals, on April 25, 2019, the Bank completed the Charter Conversion, and began operating as a New York commercial bank. Simultaneously, the Company began operating as a bank holding company. At December 31, 2019, the significant assets of the Holding Company were the capital stock of the Bank and investments retained by the Holding Company.  The liabilities of the Holding Company were comprised primarily of $115.0 million subordinated notes due in 2027, which become callable commencing in 2022.  The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
The Bank was originally founded in 1864 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank, and operated as a New York State-chartered stock savings bank until April 2019.  Effective August 1, 2016, the Bank changed its name from The Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh to Dime Community Bank.  The new name more accurately reflects the Bank’s evolving business model and emphasizes its broader geographic and business reach while retaining the Bank’s mission to be in and of the communities it serves, including the virtual online community. The Bank’s principal business is gathering deposits from customers within its market area and via the internet, and investing them primarily in multifamily residential, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, and one-to-four family residential real estate loans, as well as mortgage-backed securities, obligations of the U.S. government and government- sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), and corporate debt and equity securities.
 
The Company’s electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including copies of its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such filings, if any, are available, free of charge, as soon as practicable after they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website, www.dime.com. Information on this website is not and should not be considered to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Market Area and Competition
 
The Bank has historically operated as a community-oriented financial institution providing financial services, including various deposit related products, for its retail customer base and broker-sourced loans primarily for multifamily housing within its market areas. In early 2017, the Bank hired two seasoned executives to build out a relationship-banking platform that would provide both deposit products and relationship-based loan products to business customers in its footprint.
 
The Bank maintains its headquarters in the borough of Brooklyn, New York, and as of December 31, 2019 operated twenty-nine full-service retail banking offices located in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and in Nassau County and Suffolk County, New York. The Bank gathers deposits primarily from the communities and neighborhoods in close proximity to its branches, and via the internet. The Bank’s primary lending area is in the greater NYC metropolitan area.  The majority of the Bank’s loans are secured by properties located in its primary lending area, with approximately 79% secured by real estate located in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan as of December 31, 2019. The Bank also lends in markets that are contiguous to the aforementioned NYC boroughs.
 
The NYC banking environment is extremely competitive. The Bank’s competition for loans exists principally from savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage banks, and insurance companies and GSEs. The Bank continues to face sustained competition for the origination of multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans, which together comprised 88.7% of the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. Competition for C&I and one-to-four family loans also exists as the Bank develops these portfolios.
 
The Bank gathers deposits in direct competition with savings banks, commercial banks and brokerage firms, many among the largest in the nation. It must additionally compete for deposit monies with the stock and bond markets, especially during periods of strong performance in those arenas. Over the previous decade, consolidation in the financial services industry, coupled with the emergence of Internet banking, has dramatically altered the deposit gathering landscape. Facing increasingly larger and more efficient competitors, the Bank’s strategy to attract depositors has utilized various marketing approaches, relationship-based lending funded by low cost deposits and the delivery of technology-enhanced, and customer-friendly banking services while controlling operating expenses.

 Table of Contents     Banking competition occurs within an economic and financial marketplace that is largely beyond the control of any individual financial institution. The interest rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, while affected by marketplace competition, are generally a function of various broader-based macroeconomic and financial factors, including the supply of, and demand for, loanable funds. Within this environment, Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) monetary policy and governance of short-term rates also significantly influence the interest rates paid and charged by financial institutions.
 
The Bank’s success is additionally impacted by the overall condition of the economy, particularly in the NYC metropolitan area. As home to several national companies in the financial and business services industries, and as a popular destination for domestic and international travelers, the NYC economy is particularly sensitive to the health of both the national and global economies.
 
Lending Activities
 
The Bank historically focused on originating non-recourse loans, sourced by brokers, on multifamily and commercial real estate properties to limited liability companies. In early 2017, the Bank hired two seasoned executives to build out a relationship-banking platform that would provide both deposit products and relationship-based loan products to business customers in its footprint. The Bank’s lending is subject to the Bank’s lending policies, which are approved by the Board’s Lending and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) Committee on an annual basis. The types of loans the Bank may originate are subject to New York State (“NYS”) laws and regulations (See “Item 1. Business - Regulation – Regulation of New York State Chartered Commercial Banks”).
 
The Board of Directors of the Bank establishes lending authority levels for the various loan products offered by the Bank. The Bank maintains a Loan Operating Committee which, as of December 31, 2019, consisted of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, and Senior Vice President and Senior Lending Officer of Commercial Lending. The Loan Operating Committee has the authority to approve any portfolio loan origination. All loans approved by the Loan Operating Committee are presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors for its review.  Loans above $30 million must also be approved by the Executive Committee of the Board.
 
The Bank originates both adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”) and fixed-rate loans, depending upon customer demand and market rates of interest.
 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 – Loan Portfolio Composition” for details on the Bank’s loan portfolio.
 
Multifamily Residential and Commercial Real Estate Lending
 
The majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio consists of originating adjustable- and fixed-rate multifamily residential (generally buildings possessing a minimum of five residential units) and commercial real estate loans. The properties securing these loans are generally located in the Bank’s primary lending area.
 
At December 31, 2019, multifamily residential loans and commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank were secured by three distinct property types: (1) fully residential apartment buildings; (2) “mixed-use” properties featuring a combination of residential and commercial units within the same building; and (3) fully commercial buildings. The underwriting procedures for each of these property types were substantially similar. The Bank classified loans secured by fully residential apartment buildings as multifamily residential loans in all instances. Loans secured by fully commercial real estate were classified as commercial real estate loans in all instances. Loans secured by mixed-use properties were classified as either residential mixed-use (a component of total multifamily residential loans) or commercial mixed-use (a component of total commercial real estate loans) based upon the percentage of the property’s rental income received from its residential as compared to its commercial tenants. If 50% or more of the rental income was received from residential tenants, the full balance of the loan was classified as multifamily residential. If less than 50% of the rental income was received from residential tenants, the full balance of the loan was classified as commercial real estate.
 
Multifamily residential loans in the Bank’s portfolio generally range in amount from $1.0 million to $7.0 million.  Commercial real estate loans in the Bank’s portfolio generally range in amount from $1.0 million to $5.0 million.
 
The typical multifamily residential and commercial real estate ARM carries a final maturity of 10 or 12 years, and an amortization period not exceeding 30 years. These loans generally have an interest rate that adjusts once after the fifth or seventh year, indexed to the 5-year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) advance rate plus a spread typically approximating 250 basis points, but generally may not adjust below the initial interest rate of the loan. Prepayment fees are assessed throughout the majority of the life of the loans. The Bank may also offer interest only loans, i.e., loans that do not amortize principal during part of the contractual maturity period. The Bank also offers fixed-rate, self-amortizing, multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans with maturities of up to fifteen years.
 

5
 
 Table of Contents     Multifamily residential real estate loans are either retained in the Bank’s portfolio, sold in the secondary market to other third-party financial institutions, or may be securitized. The Bank currently has no formal arrangement pursuant to which it sells multifamily residential or commercial real estate loans to the secondary market.
 
The Bank’s underwriting standards for multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans generally require: (1) a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% based upon an appraisal performed by an independent, state licensed appraiser, and (2) sufficient rental income from the underlying property to adequately service the debt, represented by a minimum debt service ratio of 1.20x for multifamily residential and 1.25x for commercial real estate loans. The weighted average loan-to-value and debt service ratios approximated 52.7% and 1.59x, respectively, on all multifamily residential real estate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2019, and 63.9% and 1.72x, respectively, on commercial real estate loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank additionally requires all multifamily residential and commercial real estate borrowers to represent that they are unaware of any environmental risks directly related to the collateral. In instances where the Bank’s property inspection procedures indicate a potential environmental risk on a collateral property, the Bank will require a Phase 1 environmental risk analysis to be completed, and will decline loans where any significant residual environmental liability is identified. The Bank further considers the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar properties, the Bank’s lending experience with the borrower, and the borrower’s credit history and business experience, as well as other criteria.
 
It is the Bank’s policy to require appropriate insurance protection at closing, including title, hazard, and when applicable, flood insurance, on all real estate loans. Borrowers generally are required to advance funds for certain expenses such as real estate taxes, hazard insurance and flood insurance.
 
Repayment of multifamily residential loans is dependent, in significant part, on cash flow from the collateral property sufficient to satisfy operating expenses and debt service. Future increases in interest rates, increases in vacancy rates on multifamily residential or commercial buildings, and other economic events which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank could negatively impact the future net operating income of such properties. Similarly, government regulations, such as the existing NYC Rent Regulation and Rent Stabilization laws, could limit future increases in the revenue from these buildings. As a result, rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in either the loan rate at repricing or in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, and insurance).
 
Commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as exposing lenders to a greater risk of loss than both one-to-four family and multifamily residential real estate loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the collateral properties, as well as the success of the business and retail tenants occupying the properties, repayment of such loans is generally more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, or fluctuate in value based upon its rentability, among other commercial factors. This increased risk is partially mitigated in the following manners: (i) the Bank requires, in addition to the security interest in the commercial real estate, a security interest in the personal property associated with the collateral and standby assignments of rents and leases from the borrower; and (ii) the interest rate on commercial real estate loans generally exceeds that on multifamily residential loans.
 
Included in commercial real estate loans are also certain Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans in which the loan is secured by underlying real estate as collateral. The Bank may sell a portion of the loan, guaranteed by the SBA, to a third-party investor. The Bank will continue to service the loan after the sale.
 
As a NYS-chartered stock commercial bank originating loans secured by real estate having a market value at least equal to the loan amount at the time of origination, the Bank is generally not subject to the regulations of its primary regulator, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”) limiting individual loan or borrower exposures.
 
Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”) Loans
 
The C&I loan portfolio is primarily comprised of lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, and term loans. These loans are originated as part of the Bank’s relationship-based lending to borrowers who are either businesses or high net worth individuals. The owners of these businesses typically provide recourse such that they guarantee the debt. The lines of credit are generally secured by the assets of the business, though they may at times be issued on an unsecured basis. Generally speaking, they are subject to renewal on an annual basis based upon review of the borrower’s financial statements. Term loans are generally secured by either specific or general asset liens of the borrower’s business. These loans are granted based upon the strength of the cash generation ability of the borrower.

 Table of Contents      The Bank may originate adjustable- and fixed-rate C&I loans. C&I loans in the Bank’s portfolio vary in size depending on the type of product. As of December 31, 2019, the C&I portfolio primarily consisted of loans to the following industries: finance and insurance; healthcare and social assistance; real estate rental and leasing; and generally high net worth individuals. As of December 31, 2019, the largest C&I loan was $30.7 million.


Included in C&I loans are also certain SBA loans in which the loan is secured by underlying assets of the business. The Bank may sell a portion of the loan, guaranteed by the SBA, to a third-party investor. The Bank will continue to service the loan after the sale.
 
One-to-four family Residential and Condominium / Cooperative Apartment Lending
 
Prior to February 2013, the Bank generally sold its newly originated one-to-four family fixed-rate residential loans in the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Bank ceased all one-to-four family fixed-rate residential lending in order to focus on its core multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending activities.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank resumed originations of one-to-four family loan products under a newly hired, experienced Residential Lending team.  This initiative is intended to offer more lending products to its borrowers across its branch locations and existing business clientele and to diversify the Bank’s lending portfolio. The Bank will continue to sell originations of one-to-four family fixed-rate residential loans in the secondary market, and retain non-conforming and adjustable-rate loans on its balance sheet.  The Bank outsources the servicing of a portion of its one-to-four family loan portfolio, including one-to-four family loans serviced for other investors, to an unrelated third party under a sub-servicing agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Residential Lending team originated and retained $54.0 million of one-to-four family loans, with an average loan size of $0.75 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Bank originated and sold $22.7 million of one-to-four family loans.
 
Home Equity and Home Improvement Loans
 
During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Bank ceased origination of home equity and home improvement loans. In the existing portfolio, home equity loans and home improvement loans, the majority of which are included in one-to-four family loans, were originated to a maximum of $500,000. The combined balance of the first mortgage and home equity or home improvement loan was not permitted to exceed 75% of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination of the home equity or home improvement loan. At the time of origination, interest rates offered on home equity and home improvement loans was initially at the prime interest rate, and after six months, the interest rate adjusts and ranges from the prime interest rate to 100 basis points above the prime interest rate in effect at the time. The interest rate on the loan can never fall below the rate at origination. The Bank may offer home equity and home improvement loan products under the Residential Lending team during 2020.
Equity Lines of Credit on Multifamily Residential and Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
Equity lines of credit are available on multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans. These loans are underwritten in the same manner as first mortgage loans on these properties, except that the combined first mortgage amount and equity line are used to determine the loan-to-value ratio and minimum debt service coverage ratio. The interest rate on multifamily residential and commercial real estate equity lines of credit adjusts regularly.
 
Acquisition, land development and construction (“ADC”) loans
 
ADC loans help finance the purchase of land intended for further development, including single-family homes, multi-family housing, and commercial income properties. In general, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for a land acquisition loan is 50% of the appraised value of the property. The maximum loan amount is generally limited to the cost of the improvements, plus limited approval of soft costs (i.e. architect and engineering fees), subject to an overall loan-to-value limitation.
 
Consumer Loans
 
Consumer loans in the Bank’s portfolio consist of depositor loans and other consumer installment products. The balances of these loans are generally small dollar balances.
 
Asset Quality
 
General
 
The Bank does not originate or purchase loans, either whole loans or loans underlying mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), which would have been considered subprime loans at origination, i.e., real estate loans advanced to borrowers who did not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their income or credit history. See Note 6 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of evaluation for impaired investment securities and MBS.

 Table of Contents     Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans
 
Management of the Bank reviews delinquent loans on a monthly basis and reports to its Board of Directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting regarding the status of all non-performing and otherwise delinquent loans in the Bank’s portfolio.
 
The Bank’s loan servicing policies and procedures require that an automated late notice be sent to a delinquent borrower as soon as possible after a payment is ten days late in the case of multifamily residential, commercial real estate loans, and C&I loans, or fifteen days late in connection with one-to-four family or consumer loans. A second letter is sent to the borrower if payment has not been received within 30 days of the due date, or 32 days for one-to-four family loans serviced by the subservicer. Thereafter, periodic letters are mailed and phone calls placed to the borrower until payment is received. When contact is made with the borrower at any time prior to foreclosure, the Bank will attempt to obtain the full payment due or negotiate a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure.
 
Accrual of interest is generally discontinued on a loan that meets any of the following three criteria: (i) full payment of principal or interest is not expected; (ii) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more (unless the loan is both deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection); or (iii) an election has otherwise been made to maintain the loan on a cash basis due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. Such non-accrual determination practices are applied consistently to all loans regardless of their internal classification or designation. Upon entering non-accrual status, the Bank reverses all outstanding accrued interest receivable.
 
The Bank generally initiates foreclosure proceedings on real estate loans when a loan enters non-accrual status based upon non-payment, and typically does not accept partial payments once foreclosure proceedings have commenced. At some point during foreclosure proceedings, the Bank procures current appraisal information in order to prepare an estimate of the fair value of the underlying collateral. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure action is completed, the property securing the loan is transferred to Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) status. The Bank generally attempts to utilize all available remedies, such as note sales in lieu of foreclosure, in an effort to resolve non-accrual loans and OREO properties as quickly and prudently as possible in consideration of market conditions, the physical condition of the property and any other mitigating circumstances. In the event that a non-accrual loan is subsequently brought current, it is returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectability has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions for a period of at least six months.
 
The C&I portfolio is actively managed by the Bank’s lenders and underwriters. All credit facilities at a minimum require an annual review of the exposure and typically terms of the loan require annual and interim financial reporting and have financial covenants to indicate expected performance levels. Guarantors are also required to, at a minimum, annually update their financial reporting. All exposures are risk rated and those entering adverse ratings due to financial performance concerns of the borrower or material delinquency of any payments or financial reporting are subjected to added management scrutiny. Measures taken typically include amendments to the amount of the available credit facility, requirements for increased collateral, a request for a capital infusion, additional guarantor support or a material enhancement to the frequency and quality of financial reporting. Loans determined to reach adverse risk rating standards are subject to quarterly updating to Credit Administration and executive management. When warranted, loans reaching a Substandard rating could be reassigned to Credit Administration for direct handling.
 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans (“TDRs”)
 
Under ASC 310-40-15, the measurement, de-recognition, disclosure, and implementation guidance issues concerning troubled debt restructurings focused on the creditor’s records, the Bank is required to recognize loans for which certain modifications or concessions have been made as TDRs. A TDR has been created in the event that, for economic or legal reasons, a concession has been granted that would not have otherwise been considered to a debtor experiencing financial difficulties. The following criteria are considered concessions:

1. | A reduction of interest rate has been made for the remaining term of the loan;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The maturity date of the loan has been extended with a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The outstanding principal amount and/or accrued interest have been reduced.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------



In instances in which the interest rate has been reduced, management would not deem the modification a TDR in the event that the reduction in interest rate reflected either a general decline in market interest rates or an effort to maintain a relationship with a borrower who could readily obtain funds from other sources at the current market interest rate, and the terms of the restructured loan are comparable to the terms offered by the Bank to non-troubled debtors.
 

8
 
 Table of Contents     Accrual status for TDRs is determined separately for each TDR in accordance with the policies for determining accrual or non-accrual status that are outlined in the previous section titled “Monitoring and Collection of Delinquent Loans.” At the time an agreement is entered into between the Bank and the borrower that results in the Bank’s determination that a TDR has been created, the loan can be either on accrual or non-accrual status. If a loan is on non-accrual status at the time it is restructured, it continues to be classified as non-accrual until the borrower has demonstrated compliance with the modified loan terms for a period of at least six months. Conversely, if at the time of restructuring the loan is performing (and accruing); it will remain accruing throughout its restructured period, unless the loan subsequently meets any of the criteria for non-accrual status under the Bank’s policy and agency regulations.
 
The Bank never accepts receivables or equity interests in satisfaction of TDRs.
 
For TDRs that demonstrate conditions sufficient to warrant accrual status, the present value of the expected net cash flows of the underlying property is utilized as the primary means of determining impairment. Any shortfall in the present value of the expected net cash flows calculated at each measurement period (typically quarter-end) compared to the present value of the expected net cash flows at the time of the original loan agreement was recognized as either an allocated reserve (in the event that it related to lower expected interest payments) or a charge-off (if related to lower expected principal payments). For TDRs on non-accrual status, an appraisal of the underlying real estate collateral is deemed the most appropriate measure to utilize when evaluating impairment, and any shortfall in valuation from the recorded balance is accounted for through a charge-off. In the event that either an allocated reserve or a charge-off is recognized on TDRs, the periodic loan loss provision is impacted.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) require the Bank to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The Bank maintains a Loan Loss Reserve Committee consisting of the Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Senior Vice President and Controller, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Senior Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, First Vice President - Loan Servicing, and Director of Credit Administration, charged with, among other functions, responsibility for monitoring the appropriateness of the loan loss reserve.
 
To assist the Loan Loss Reserve Committee in carrying out its assigned duties, the Bank engages the services of an independent, experienced third-party loan review firm to perform a review of the loan portfolio. The 2019 review program covered 50% of the non-one-to-four family and consumer loan portfolio, 100% of ADC loans, 100% of SBA loans, 100% of C&I loans greater than $0.25 million, and 100% of owner-occupied non-farm non-residential loans. Included within the annual 50% target of the non-one-to-four family and consumer loan portfolio were:
 
  
(1) | twenty largest loan relationships;
----+-----------------------------------


(2) | twenty largest loans;
----+----------------------


(3) | ten largest multifamily residential real estate loans;
----+-------------------------------------------------------


(4) | ten largest multifamily mixed-use real estate loans;
----+-----------------------------------------------------


(5) | ten largest pure commercial real estate loan portfolio;
----+--------------------------------------------------------


(6) | ten largest commercial mixed-use real estate loans;
----+----------------------------------------------------


(7) | all loans over $500,000 that were scheduled to reprice during the year;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | 30% of all new loan originations during the year;
----+--------------------------------------------------


(9) | 70% of all commercial real estate loans;
----+-----------------------------------------


(10) | internally criticized and classified loans over $250,000 plus additionally identified loans;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(11) | all commercial loans over $1.5 million that were in the lowest three categories of pass loan grade (including Watch list loans);
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(12) | all ADC loans;
-----+---------------


(13) | all SBA loans;
-----+---------------


(14) | all C&I over $250,000 plus additionally identified loans; and
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(15) | all owner-occupied commercial real estate.
-----+-------------------------------------------



The Loan Loss Reserve Committee’s findings, along with recommendations for changes to loan loss reserve provisions, if any, are reported directly to certain members of the Bank’s executive management and the Board of Directors.
 
The Loan Loss Reserve Committee evaluates the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis in order to maintain its allowance for loan losses at a level it believes appropriate to absorb probable losses incurred within the Bank’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. Factors considered in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses include the Bank’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, existing adverse situations which may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions in the Bank’s lending area. Although management uses available information to estimate losses on loans, future additions to, or reductions in, the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or other factors beyond management’s control. In addition, the Bank’s regulators, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses, and may require the Bank to recognize additions to, or reductions in, the allowance based upon judgments different from those of management.

 Table of Contents     The Bank’s periodic evaluation of its allowance for loan losses is comprised of different components, each of which is discussed in Note 7 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Bank also maintains a reserve associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by the borrower. This reserve is determined based upon the outstanding volume of loan commitments at each period end. Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in periodic non-interest expense.
 
In September 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update “(ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), referred to as “Current Expected Credit Loss”  (“CECL”), which requires that the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date be based on historical experience, current condition, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard requires financial institutions and other organizations to use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates.
 
In anticipation of adoption, the Company has established the CECL Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Loan Loss Reserve Committee to oversee the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has licensed a third party model to assist with the measurement of expected credit losses. The CECL Subcommittee has determined loan segments based on credit risk of the loan portfolio, completed data validation, and developed qualitative adjustments. The CECL Subcommittee is in the process of developing and updating internal policies, procedures, and key controls over the calculation of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”). The Company has also engaged an independent third party vendor which is in the process of reviewing the regression models, assumptions utilized, and validating the model for measuring the expected credit losses. The model validation report has not yet been finalized.
 
Upon adoption, the Company expects to recognize a one-time cumulative effect change to the allowance for loan losses. The Company is currently estimating that the impact upon adoption of CECL, including off-balance sheet exposures, as well as current economic conditions and forecasts, will not have an  impact to the consolidated financial statements based on the Bank’s current loan portfolio. The Company estimates that the change in the ACL from the probable incurred allowance for loan losses could be in the range of a decrease of $2.0 million to an increase of $2.0 million. Upon completion of the aforementioned items, the Loan Loss Reserve Committee, who has oversight over the implementation of CECL, is expected to finalize and approve the adoption of the standard during the first quarter of 2020.
 
Investment Activities
 
Investment strategies are implemented by the Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Retail Officer, and other senior officers. The strategies take into account the overall composition of the Bank’s balance sheet, including loans and deposits, and are intended to protect and enhance the Bank’s earnings and market value, and effectively manage both interest rate risk and liquidity. The strategies are reviewed periodically by the ALCO and reported to the Board of Directors.
 
Investment Policy of the Bank
 
The investment policy of the Bank, which is approved by its Board of Directors, is designed to help achieve the Bank’s overall asset/liability management objectives while complying with applicable regulations. Generally, when selecting investments for the Bank’s portfolio, the policy emphasizes principal preservation, liquidity, diversification, short maturities and/or repricing terms, and a favorable return on investment. The policy permits investments in various types of liquid assets, including obligations of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, various types of MBS, municipal securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit (“CDs”) and when applicable, overnight federal funds sold to financial institutions. The Bank’s Board of Directors periodically approves all financial institutions to which the Bank may sell federal funds.
 
The Bank’s investment policy allows for new investments in corporate debt to companies rated “investment grade” according to the investment policy at the time of purchase, and limits investments in any one corporate entity to the lesser of 2% of total assets or 20% of the Bank’s total capital. The investment policy limits a combined investment in securities issued by any one entity, with the exception of obligations of the U.S. Government, federal agencies and GSEs, to an amount not exceeding: 1% of total assets and 5% of the Bank’s total capital for municipal securities with a single “A” rating, 2% of total assets and 10% of total capital for municipal securities with a triple “A” rating, 1% of total assets and 15% of the Bank’s total capital for MBS and CMO securities with single “A” ratings, and 2% of total assets and 20% of total capital for MBS and CMO securities with triple “A” ratings. The Bank was in compliance with this policy limit at both December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank may engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments with Board approval. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank did not hold any derivative instruments or embedded derivative instruments that required bifurcation.

 Table of Contents     Federal Agency Obligations and Corporate Securities
 
Federal agency obligations and corporate securities are purchased from time to time in order to provide the Bank a favorable yield in comparison to overnight investments. Federal Agency Obligations possess sound credit ratings, and are readily accepted as collateral for the Bank’s borrowings. The Bank reviews the financials of the issuer of corporate note securities to assess the financial health and quality, as defined by the Bank’s investment policy, of the issuer at the time of purchase, and on annual basis.
MBS
 
The Bank’s investment policy calls for the purchase of only priority tranches when investing in MBS, and typically possess the highest credit rating from at least one nationally recognized rating agency. MBS provide the portfolio with investments offering desirable repricing, cash flow and credit quality characteristics. MBS yield less than the loans that underlie the securities as a result of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements which reduce credit risk to the investor. Although MBS guaranteed by federally sponsored agencies carry a reduced credit risk compared to whole loans, such securities remain subject to the risk that fluctuating interest rates, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of such loans and thus affect the value of such securities. MBS, however, are more liquid than individual real estate loans and may readily be used to collateralize borrowings. MBS also provide the Company with important interest rate risk management features, as the entire portfolio provides monthly cash flow for re-investment at current market interest rates.
Investment Strategies of the Holding Company
 
The Holding Company’s investment policy generally calls for investments in relatively short-term, liquid securities similar to those permitted by the securities investment policy of the Bank. The investment policy allows for new investments in corporate debt to companies rated “investment grade” according to the investment policy at the time of purchase, and limits investments in any one corporate entity to the lesser of 2% of total assets or 20% of the Company’s total capital. The investment policy limits a combined investment in securities issued by any one entity, with the exception of obligations of the U.S. Government, federal agencies and GSEs, to an amount not exceeding: 1% of total assets and 5% of the Company’s total capital for municipal securities with a single “A” rating, 2% of total assets and 10% of total capital for municipal securities with a triple “A” rating, 1% of total assets and 15% of the Company’s total capital for MBS and CMO securities with single “A” ratings, and 2% of total assets and 20% of total capital for MBS and CMO securities with Triple “A” ratings. The Holding Company may, with Board approval, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Holding Company did not hold any derivative instruments or embedded derivative instruments that required bifurcation.
 
Holding Company investments are generally intended primarily to provide future liquidity which may be utilized for general business activities, including, but not limited to: (1) purchases of Common Stock into treasury; (2) repayment of principal and interest on the Holding Company’s subordinated notes payable; (3) subject to applicable restrictions, the payment of dividends on the Common Stock; and/or (4) investments in the equity securities of other financial institutions and other investments not permitted to the Bank.
 
The Holding Company cannot assure that it will engage in these investment activities in the future. At December 31, 2019, the Holding Company’s principal asset was its $689.5 million investment in the Bank’s common stock. This investment in its subsidiary is not actively managed and falls outside of the Holding Company investment policy and strategy discussed above.
 
GAAP requires that investments in debt securities be classified in one of the following three categories and accounted for accordingly: trading securities, securities available-for-sale or securities held-to-maturity. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity referred to as accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of deferred taxes.  GAAP requires investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values be classified as marketable equity securities, with changes in fair value recognized through the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

 Table of Contents      Sources of Funds


General
 
The Bank’s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits, loan and MBS payments, investment security principal and interest payments, and advances from the FHLBNY and overnight or short-term borrowings from the American Financial Exchange (“AFX”). The Bank may also sell or securitize selected multifamily residential, mixed-use and one-to-four family residential real estate loans to private sector secondary market purchasers and has in the past sold such loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), and the State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”). The Company may additionally issue debt or capital stock under appropriate circumstances. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments on real estate loans and MBS are influenced by interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
Deposits
 
The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts possessing a range of interest rates and terms, including savings, money market, interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts, and CDs. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition from other financial institutions and investment products. The Bank relies upon direct and general marketing, customer service, convenience and long-standing relationships with customers or borrowers to generate deposits. The communities in which the Bank maintains branch offices have historically provided the great majority of its deposits.
 
The Bank also participates in various brokered deposits programs to obtain brokered deposits, such as Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), through which it can either purchase or sell CDs, and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”), through which it can either purchase or sell money market accounts. Purchases of brokered deposits are limited by Bank policy to an aggregate of 10% of total assets.
 
Borrowings
 
In June 2017, the Company issued $115.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due June 2027, which will become callable commencing in June 2022. Interest will be paid semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15 at a fixed annual interest rate equal to 4.50%, until June 2022, at which point the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then current three-month LIBOR plus 266 basis points. The notes will mature on June 15, 2027. The Company used part of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem its $70.7 million of trust preferred securities, which had a 7.00% annual coupon in July 2017.
 
The Bank has been a member and shareholder of the FHLBNY since 1980. One of the privileges offered to FHLBNY shareholders is the ability to secure advances from the FHLBNY under various lending programs at competitive interest rates.
 
In December 2018, the Bank became a member of AFX, through which it may either borrow or lend funds on an overnight or short-term basis with other member institutions. The availability of funds changes daily.
 
Capital Stock Issuance
 
On February 5, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 2,999,200 shares, or $75.0 million in aggregate liquidation preference, of its 5.50% Fixed-Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Stock”), with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The Company will pay dividends from the original date of issuance, when, as, and if declared by its board of directors, at a fixed rate of 5.50% per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2020. The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no stated maturity. The Company may redeem the Preferred Stock at its option at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends), subject to regulatory approval, on or after February 15, 2025, or within 90 days under certain circumstances.
Subsidiary Activities
 
In addition to the Bank, the Holding Company’s indirect subsidiaries consist of seven corporations, which are wholly-owned by the Bank. The following table presents an overview of the Holding Company’s indirect subsidiaries, other than the Bank, as of December 31, 2019:

 Table of Contents      Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 421 full-time and 36 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit, and the Holding Company and all of its subsidiaries consider their relationships with their employees to be good.
Federal, State and Local Taxation
 
The following is a general description of material tax matters and does not purport to be a comprehensive review of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
Federal Taxation
 
For federal income tax purposes, the Company files a consolidated income tax return on a December 31st calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including, particularly, the Bank’s tax reserve for bad debts.
 
The Bank, as a “large bank” under Internal Revenue Service classifications (i.e., one with assets having an adjusted basis in excess of $500 million), is: (i) unable to make additions to its tax bad debt reserve, (ii) permitted to deduct bad debts only as they occur, and (iii) required to recapture (i.e., take into taxable income) the balance of its “base year tax bad debt reserve” (i.e., its tax bad debt reserve as of December 31, 1987) under certain distribution scenarios discussed below. The Bank’s accumulated bad debt reserves totaled $15.2 million, for which no provision for income tax was required to be recorded for the tax liability that would result upon the recapture of the base year tax bad debt reserve. The amount of tax liability that would result from a full recapture of the base year tax bad debt reserve is $5.0 million, as additional income tax expense. These bad debt reserves could be subject to recapture into taxable income under certain circumstances, including a distribution of the bad debt benefits to the Holding Company or the failure of the Bank to qualify as a bank for federal income tax purposes. The Bank does not anticipate making any distributions that would result in a full or partial recapture of the base year tax bad debt reserve.
 
On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and business. For businesses, the Tax Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%. The rate reduction took effect January 1, 2018.
 
Under GAAP, the Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be recovered or settled. As of a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Act, the Company recorded tax expense of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
State and Local Taxation
 
The Company is subject to NYS franchise tax on a consolidated basis. NYS enacted several reforms in 2014 (the “Tax Reform Package”) to its tax structure, including changes to the franchise, sales, estate and personal income taxes. These changes generally became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The Tax Reform Package is intended to simplify the existing corporate tax code for NYS businesses while remaining relatively neutral in relation to corporate tax receipts. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the NYS income tax rate applied to the Company apportioned NYS taxable income is 6.5%.
 
The Company is subject to NYC franchise tax on a consolidated basis. NYC generally conforms its tax law to NYS tax law, and adopted conforming Tax Reform Package provisions similar to those described above for NYS purposes, with only a few minor differences. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the NYC income tax rate applied to the Company apportioned NYC taxable income is 8.85%.

 Table of Contents     State of Delaware
 
As a Delaware holding company not conducting business in Delaware, the Holding Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax. However, it is required to file an annual report and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware based upon the assumed par value capital method.
Regulation
 
General
 
The Bank is a NYS-chartered commercial bank.  It was formerly a NYS-chartered savings bank but converted to a NYS commercial bank charter, effective April 25, 2019.  The Holding Company became a bank holding company, rather than a savings and loan holding company, at the same time.  The Bank’s primary regulator is the NYSDFS, and the Bank’s primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), which regulates and examines state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“State Nonmember Banks”). The FDIC also administers laws and regulations applicable to all FDIC-insured depository institutions. The Holding Company is a bank holding company, within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”) and is subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) and, more specifically, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 
The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The Bank is required to file reports with both the NYSDFS and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and to obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. Both the NYSDFS and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a state-chartered bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders, investors or creditors other than insured depositors. As a publicly-held unitary bank holding company, the Holding Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, both the SEC, under the federal securities laws, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
 
The NYSDFS and the FDIC possess significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the NYSDFS, the FDIC or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of either the Bank or Holding Company.
 
The following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes and regulations applicable to NYS chartered commercial banks and bank holding companies. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations discussed.
 
Regulation of New York State Chartered Commercial Banks
 
Business Activities. The Bank derives its lending, investment, and other authority primarily from the New York Banking Law (“NYBL”) and the regulations of the NYSDFS, subject to limitations under applicable FDIC laws and regulations. Pursuant to the NYBL, the Bank may invest in all types of loans including real estate loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, and commercial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities (including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state, and local governments and agencies), and certain other assets. The lending powers of NYS-chartered commercial banks are not generally subject to percentage-of-assets or capital limitations, although there are limits applicable to loans to individual borrowers.
Recent Financial Regulatory Reforms
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”), which became law in 2010, was intended to address perceived weaknesses in the U.S. financial regulatory system and prevent future economic and financial crises. Many of the provisions of the Reform Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or require the issuance of implementing regulations. Implementation is ongoing and the Reform Act has, at a minimum, resulted in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and other costs for the Bank and Holding Company.

 Table of Contents     Basel III Capital Rules
 
On January 1, 2015, the Bank and the Holding Company became subject to a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that was issued by the FDIC and FRB in July 2013 (the “Basel III Capital Rules”), subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets ratios: a) 4.5% based upon common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”); b) 6.0% based upon tier 1 capital; and c) 8.0% based upon total regulatory capital. A minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital as a percentage of average consolidated assets) of 4.0% is also required under the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules additionally require institutions to retain a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, of 2.5% above these required minimum capital ratio levels. Banking organizations that fail to maintain the minimum 2.5% capital conservation buffer could face restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Restrictions would begin phasing in where the banking organization’s capital conservation buffer was below 2.5% at the beginning of a quarter, and distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be completely prohibited if no capital conservation buffer exists.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provided for a number of deductions from, and adjustments to, CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that servicing right assets (“SRA”), deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
 
Implementation of the deductions from, and other adjustments to, CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and were phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and increased by 0.625% each subsequent January 1, until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The Basel III Capital Rules also revised the definitions and components of regulatory capital, and addressed other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also addressed asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.
 
With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules revised the “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) regulations adopted pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the previous 6.0%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules increased the required capital levels of the Bank and subjected the Holding Company to consolidated capital rules. The Bank and Holding Company made the one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in stockholders’ equity for the purposes of determining the regulatory capital ratios. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters.
 
In accordance with the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies have adopted, effective January 1, 2020, a final rule whereby depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9% tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets, will be eligible to opt into a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” framework.  The alternative framework will first be available for use in the Bank’s March 31, 2020 Call Report.  Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules and will be considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action statutes.  The agencies reserved the authority to disallow the use of the Community Bank Leverage Ratio by a financial institution or holding company based on the risk profile of the organization.
 
FDIC Guidance on Managing Market Risk
 
In October 2013, the FDIC published guidance entitled “Managing Sensitivity to Market Risk in a Challenging Interest Rate Environment”. This guidance notes the FDIC’s ongoing supervisory concern that certain institutions may be insufficiently prepared or positioned for sustained increases in, or volatility of, interest rates. The guidance emphasizes a series of best practices to ensure that State Nonmember Banks, such as the Bank, have adopted a comprehensive asset-liability and interest rate risk management process. These practices include: (i) effective board governance and oversight; (ii) a sound policy framework and prudent exposure limits; (iii) well-developed risk measurement tools for effective measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk and; (iv) effective risk mitigation strategies. The Bank continues to comply with this guidance.

 Table of Contents     FDIC Real Estate Lending Standards
 
FDIC regulations prescribe standards for extensions of credit that (i) are secured by liens on or interests in real estate, or (ii) are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate. FDIC regulations require nonmember banks to establish and maintain written real estate lending policies that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities. The policies must also be consistent with accompanying interagency guidelines, which include loan-to-value limitations for different types of real estate loans. Under certain circumstances, institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the loan-to-value limitations. In addition, the federal banking agencies (the “Agencies”) consider as part of their ongoing supervisory monitoring processes whether an institution is exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions that (i) have experienced rapid growth in their commercial real estate lending, (ii) have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate or (iii) are approaching or have exceeded the following concentration thresholds may become subject to additional regulatory review: (a) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of the institution’s total capital; or (b) total commercial real estate loans, excluding owner occupied properties, represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
Limitation on Capital Distributions
 
The NYBL and the New York banking regulations, as well as FDIC and FRB regulations impose limitations upon capital distributions by state-chartered banks, such as cash dividends, payments to purchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger, and other distributions charged against capital.
 
Under the NYBL and the New York banking regulations, NYS-chartered commercial banks may declare and pay dividends out of net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital, however, approval of the New York State Superintendent of Financial Services (‘‘Superintendent’’) is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid.
 
Under FDIC PCA regulations, the Bank would be prohibited from making a capital distribution if, after the distribution, the Bank would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements, as described above (See “Part I - Item 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation of New York State Chartered Commercial Banks – PCA”).
 
Liquidity
 
Pursuant to FDIC regulations, the Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation.
 
Assessments
 
NYS-chartered commercial banks are required by the NYBL to pay annual assessments to the NYSDFS in connection with its regulation and supervision (including examination) of the Bank. This annual assessment is based primarily on the asset size of the Bank, among other factors determined by the NYSDFS. The Bank is not required to pay additional assessments to the FDIC for its regulation and supervision (including examination) of the Bank as a State Nonmember Bank, however, the Bank is required to pay assessments to the FDIC as an insured depository institution. (See “Insurance of Deposit Accounts”).
Branching
 
Subject to certain limitations, NYS and federal law permit NYS-chartered banks to establish branches in any state of the United States. In general, federal law allows the FDIC, and the NYBL allows the Superintendent, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches by merger. The NYBL authorizes NYS-chartered banks to open and occupy de novo branches outside the State of New York. Pursuant to the Reform Act, the FDIC is authorized to approve the establishment by a state bank of a de novo interstate branch if the intended host state allows de novo branching within that state by banks chartered by that state.
 
Community Reinvestment
 
Under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution possesses a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help satisfy the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are most appropriate to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a State Nonmember Bank, to assess the bank’s record of satisfying the credit needs of its community and consider such record in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination. Regulations additionally require that the Bank publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the CRA. The Bank has no such agreements.
 

16
 
 Table of Contents     The Bank is also subject to provisions of the NYBL that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a NYS-chartered bank to serve the credit needs of its local community (the ‘‘NYCRA’’). Such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA. The NYCRA requires the NYSDFS to make a periodic written assessment of an institution’s compliance with the NYCRA, utilizing a four-tiered rating system, and to make such assessment available to the public. The NYCRA also requires the Superintendent to consider the NYCRA rating when reviewing an application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices or ATMs, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. The Bank’s most recent rating under the NYCRA was “Satisfactory”.
Transactions with Related Parties
 
The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its ‘‘affiliates’’ is limited by FDIC regulations, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (‘‘FRA’’), and Regulation W issued by the FRB. FDIC regulations regarding transactions with affiliates generally conform to Regulation W. These provisions, among other matters, prohibit, limit or place restrictions upon a depository institution extending credit to, purchasing assets from, or entering into certain transactions (including securities lending, repurchase agreements and derivatives activities) with, its affiliates, which, for the Bank, would include the Holding Company and any other subsidiary of the Holding Company.
 
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers, and stockholders owning 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is additionally governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the FRB enacted thereunder. Among other matters, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: (i) be made on terms substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (ii) not exceed certain amount limitations individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. Regulation O additionally requires that extensions of credit in excess of certain limits be approved in advance by the bank’s board of directors.
 
New York banking regulations impose certain limits and requirements on various transactions with “insiders,” as defined in the New York banking regulations to include certain executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.
 
Historically, the Bank prohibited loans to its directors and executive officers. In April 2018, the Bank approved a policy permitting loans to directors and executive officers secured by their primary residences substantially on the same terms and conditions the Bank extends credit to its borrowers. At December 31, 2019, there were no loans to directors or executive officers secured by their primary residences.  The Holding Company presently prohibits loans to directors and executive officers.
 
Enforcement
 
Under the NYBL, the Superintendent possesses enforcement power over NYS-chartered commercial banks. The NYBL gives the Superintendent authority to order a NYS-chartered bank to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to maintain prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the Superintendent that a director, trustee or officer of a bank has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting its business after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee, or officer may be removed from office after notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Superintendent also has authority to appoint a conservator or receiver, such as the FDIC, for a bank under certain circumstances.
 
Under the FDIA, the FDIC possesses enforcement authority for FDIC insured depository institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action, including civil monetary penalties, against insured institutions and all ‘‘institution-affiliated parties,’’ including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder, attorney, appraiser or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation, breach of fiduciary duty or certain other wrongful actions that cause, or are likely to cause, more than minimal loss to or other significant adverse effect on an insured depository institution. Under the BHCA and the FDIA, the FRB possesses similar authority to bring enforcement actions and impose civil monetary penalties against bank holding companies for violations of applicable law or regulation. In addition, regulators possess substantial discretion to take enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with the law, particularly with respect to capital requirements. Possible enforcement actions range from informal enforcement actions, such as a memorandum of understanding, to formal enforcement actions, such as a written agreement, cease and desist order or civil money penalty, the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to receivership, conservatorship, or the termination of deposit insurance.

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, the FDIC, together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other features, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the FDIC has adopted regulations pursuant to FDICIA that authorize, but do not require, the FDIC to order an institution that has been given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so ordered, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized bank is subject under the PCA provisions of FDICIA (See “Part I - Item 1. Business - Regulation - Regulation of New York State Chartered Commercial Banks – PCA”). If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek enforcement in judicial proceedings and the imposition of civil money penalties.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
 
The standard maximum amount of FDIC deposit insurance is $250,000 per depositor. Insured depository institutions are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. Assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity. The assessment rate is determined through a risk-based system, with institutions deemed most risky paying higher assessments. For depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, the assessments are now primarily based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. The initial base assessment rate for institutions of less than $10 billion in assets currently ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate for such institutions could range from 1.5 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis.
 
As a result of the failures of a number of banks and thrifts in previous years, there has been a significant increase in the loss provisions of the DIF. This resulted in a decline in the DIF reserve ratio during 2008 below the then minimum designated reserve ratio of 1.15%. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Reform Act. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% of total insured deposits. The rule imposed a surcharge on the assessments of depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets beginning the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reached or exceeded 1.35% and December 31, 2018. As a depository institution with less than $10 billion in assets, this rule did not apply to the Bank. The FDIC indicated in November 2018 that the 1.35% DIF ratio has been exceeded and that institutions of less than $10 billion of assets would receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to raising the reserve ratios from 1.15% to 1.35%, beginning when the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%.  The FDIC has established a long-term target for the reserve ratio of 2.0%. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.
 
Acquisitions
 
Under the Federal Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the FDIC will consider, among other factors, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA (see “Community Reinvestment”) and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
Privacy and Security Protection
 
The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations for consumer privacy protection that require financial institutions to adopt procedures to protect customers and their “non-public personal information.” The regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship, and annually thereafter if there are changes to its policy. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers the ability to “opt-out” of: (1) the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties if the sharing of such information does not satisfy any of the permitted exceptions; and (2) the receipt of marketing solicitations from Bank affiliates.

 Table of Contents     The Bank is additionally subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the federal banking agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, including administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial customer harm or inconvenience.
 
Federal law additionally permits each state to enact legislation that is more protective of consumers’ personal information. There are periodically privacy bills considered by the New York legislature. Management of the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of these bills if enacted.
 
Cybersecurity more broadly has become a focus of federal and state regulators. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two statements regarding cybersecurity to reiterate regulatory expectations regarding cyberattacks compromising credentials and business continuity planning to ensure the rapid recovery of an institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. In October 2016, federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision. Once established, the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyber-attack or other cyber-related failure on the financial system. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards: (1) cyber risk governance; (2) cyber risk management; (3) internal dependency management; (4) external dependency management; and (5) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. In March 2017, the NYSDFS made effective regulations that require financial institutions regulated by the NYSDFS, including the Bank, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.  In January 2020, the FDIC issued a “Statement on Heightened Cybersecurity Risk” to remind regulated institutions of sound cybersecurity risk management principles.  The Company will continue to monitor any developments related to these proposed rulemakings as part of its ongoing cyber risk management. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors” for a further discussion of cybersecurity risks.
 
Consumer Protection and Compliance Provisions
 
The Bank is subject to various consumer protection laws and regulations. The Bank may be subject to potential liability for material violations of these laws and regulations, in the form of litigation by governmental and consumer groups, the FDIC and other federal regulatory agencies including the Department of Justice. Moreover, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all depository institutions, as well as the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices.
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) System
 
The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY, which is one of the eleven regional FHLBs composing the FHLB System. Each FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. Any advances from the FHLBNY must be secured by specified types of collateral, and long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance. The Bank, as a member of the FHLBNY, is currently required to acquire and hold shares of FHLBNY Class B stock as a membership requirement and must hold additional stock based on its FHLB borrowing and certain other activities. The Bank was in compliance with these requirements with an investment in FHLBNY Class B stock of $56.0 million at December 31, 2019. The FHLBNY can adjust the specific percentages and dollar amount periodically within the ranges established by the FHLBNY capital plan.
Federal Reserve System
 
The Bank is subject to FRB regulations requiring state-chartered depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a low-interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank’s interest-earning assets. The balances maintained to satisfy the FRB reserve requirements may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the FDIC.
 
The Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institutions’ required and excess reserve balances. The interest rate paid on required reserve balances and excess balances as of December 31, 2019 was 1.55%.
 
Depository institutions are additionally authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve ‘‘discount window,’’ however, FRB regulations require such institutions to hold reserves in the form of vault cash or deposits with Federal Reserve Banks in order to borrow.

 Table of Contents     Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification
 
Financial institutions are subject to Bank Secrecy Act amendments and specific federal agency guidance in relation to implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“PATRIOT Act”). The PATRIOT Act provides the federal government with powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the PATRIOT Act enacted measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of Title III and the FDIC guidance impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks and thrifts. Title III imposes the following requirements, among others, with respect to financial institutions: (i) establishment of anti-money laundering programs; (ii) establishment of procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers opening new accounts, including verifying their identity within a reasonable period of time; (iii) establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and (iv) prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. In addition, the NYSDFS issued a final regulation in June 2016 that sets forth, for financial institutions chartered or licensed under the New York Banking Law, the attributes of certain compliance programs such institutions must have to ensure compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering laws and regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The regulation requires the board of directors or a senior officer of an institution to make an annual finding as to an institution’s compliance with the requirements of the regulation.
 
Finally, bank regulators are directed to consider an organization’s effectiveness in preventing money laundering when reviewing and acting on regulatory applications.
 
OFAC Regulation
 
OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
 
Regulation of the Holding Company
 
The Holding Company is registered with the FRB as a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA. The Holding Company is currently subject to FRB regulations, examination, enforcement and supervision, as well as reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary depository institution. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Holding Company’s non-depository institution subsidiaries.
 
The Holding Company’s activities are limited to the activities permissible for bank holding companies, which generally include activities deemed by the FRB to be closely related or a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks.  A bank holding company that meets certain qualitative criteria may elect to be regulated as a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities, such as underwriting equity securities and insurance.  The Holding Company has not, up to now, elected to be regulated as a financial holding company.
 
Federal law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a class of voting securities of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, another bank or bank holding company, without prior written approval of the FRB. In evaluating applications by bank holding companies to acquire banks, the FRB considers, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community, competitive factors and compliance with anti-money laundering laws.
 
The Reform Act codified the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine applicable to depository institution to savings and loan holding companies. The FRB has issued regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
 
The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank and holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may also be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also specifies that a holding company should consult with FRB supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common or perpetual preferred stock when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock such that the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. FRB regulations specifically require agency approval for stock repurchases by bank holding companies in certain situations. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

 Table of Contents     Restrictions on the Acquisition of the Holding Company
 
Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (“CIBCA”) and implementing regulations, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the shares of outstanding Common Stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of the Holding Company. Under CIBCA and implementing regulations, the FRB generally has 60 days within which to act on such notices, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer; the convenience and needs of the communities served by the Holding Company, the Bank; and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Under the BHCA, any company would be required to obtain approval from the FRB before it may obtain “control” of the Holding Company within the meaning of the BHCA. Control is generally defined to mean the ownership or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Holding Company or the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of the Holding Company’s directors, although a person or entity may also be determined to “control” the Holding Company without satisfying these requirements if it is determined that he, she or it directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Holding Company. In addition, an existing bank holding company would, under federal banking laws and regulations, generally be required to obtain FRB approval before acquiring more than 5% of the Holding Company’s voting stock.
 
In addition to the applicable federal laws and regulations, NYS Banking Law generally requires prior approval of the Superintendent before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution organized in New York.
 
Federal Securities Laws
 
The Common Stock and Preferred Stock are registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. They are subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.
Delaware Corporation Law
 
The Holding Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and, therefore, is subject to regulation by the State of Delaware, and the rights of its shareholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
