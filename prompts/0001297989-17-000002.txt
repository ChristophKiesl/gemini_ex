ITEM 1. Business
ExlService Holdings, Inc. (“EXL”, “we”, “us", "our" or the "Company"), incorporated in Delaware in 2002, is an operations management and analytics company that helps businesses enhance growth and profitability. Using our proprietary platforms, methodologies and tools we look deeper to help companies improve global operations, enhance data-driven insights, increase customer satisfaction, and manage risk and compliance. We serve our customers in the insurance, healthcare, travel, transportation and logistics, banking and financial services and utilities industries, among others. Headquartered in New York, we have approximately 26,000 professionals in locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
We operate in the business process management (“BPM”) industry and we provide operations management and analytics services. Our eight operating segments are strategic business units that align our products and services with how we manage our business, approach our key markets and interact with our clients. Six of those operating segments provide BPM or “operations management” services, which we organize into industry-focused operating segments (Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Banking and Financial Services, and Utilities) and one “capability” operating segment (finance and accounting) that provides services to clients in our industry-focused segments as well as clients across other industries. In each of these six operating segments we provide operations management services, which typically involve transfer to the Company of select business operations of a client, after which we administer and manage those operations for our client on an ongoing basis. Our remaining two operating segments are Consulting, which provides industry-specific transformational services related to operations management services, and our Analytics operating segment, which provides services that focus on driving improved business outcomes for clients by generating data-driven insights across all parts of their business. 
In prior years we presented two reportable segments: Operations Management (which included our insurance, healthcare, travel, transportation and logistics, finance and accounting, banking and financial services, utilities and consulting operating segments) and Analytics. Effective for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, we present information for the following reportable segments:

• | Insurance


• | Healthcare


• | Travel, Transportation and Logistics


• | Finance and Accounting, and


• | Analytics

The remaining operating segments which includes our banking and financial services, utilities and consulting operating segments have been included in a category called “All Other”. Segment information for all prior years presented herein has been changed to conform to the current presentation. This change in segment presentation does not affect our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. We do not allocate assets by operating segment, although our operating segments do manage and control certain assets. For further descriptions of our segments, including financial information and revenues and cost of revenues, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
The July 2016 acquisition of Liss Systems Limited ("Liss") is included in the Insurance reportable segment and the September 2016 acquisition of IQR Consulting Inc. ("IQR") along with the October 2016 acquisition of Datasource Consulting, LLC ("Datasource") are included in the Analytics reportable segment.
Operations Management Services
Our operations management services, which we provide from our Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Finance and Accounting, Banking and Financial Services, Utilities and Consulting operating segments, typically involve the transfer to EXL of select business operations of a client such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations for our client on an ongoing basis, or in case of consulting, consulting services related to BPM services. We use a focused industry vertical approach to manage our business and to provide a suite of integrated BPM services to organizations in the insurance, healthcare, travel transportation and logistics, banking and financial services and utilities industries in addition to providing finance and accounting and consulting services across these industries as well as to clients in other industries like manufacturing, media among others.

The key differentiators and salient features of our BPM services include our agile operating and delivery model utilizing domain expertise and process excellence, the Business EXLerator FrameworkTM, our ability to deploy a Business Process-as-a-Service (“BPaaS”) delivery model, business process automation (including robotics), consulting-driven transformation and our industry vertical focused approach. The Business EXLerator FrameworkTM is our integrated approach to operations management which enables us to drive better customer outcomes by using advanced automation (such as robotics), lean six-sigma, workflow management, data visualization and embedded analytics. A visual description of this approach is in the figure below.
While the majority of our operations management services are provided to clients using client-owned or licensed technology platforms, we also deliver our services across clients and industries using a BPaaS delivery model. The BPaaS delivery model includes the provision of a technology platform along with process management services. The service offering typically requires lower capital outlay, is faster to implement and is priced based on the number of transactions or usage by the client. These services may use standardized and shared technology and operational delivery infrastructure enabling us to leverage technology and infrastructure investments across multiple clients.
The operating segments providing operations management services are described below:
Our Insurance operating segment serves property and casualty insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, annuity and retirement services companies. We provide BPM services related to business processes in the insurance industry such as claims processing, subrogation, premium and benefit administration, agency management, account reconciliation, policy research, underwriting support, new business processing, policy servicing, premium audit, surveys, billing and collection, commercial and residential survey, and customer service. In 2016, we continued to develop our BPaaS delivery model by deploying new platforms for providing distinctive BPM services to our clients. We provide insurance policy administration services using a BPaaS delivery model through our LifePRO ® platform in order to help clients administer life insurance, health insurance, annuities and credit life and disability insurance policies. We also provide subrogation services to property and casualty insurers using a BPaaS delivery model and our Subrosource ® software platform, the largest commercial end-to-end subrogation platform. Subrosource ® integrates with client systems, manages recovery workflow, increases recoveries and reduces costs. In 2016, we acquired Liss, a provider of digital customer acquisition and policy administration services for the insurance industry. Applicable to both the life & pensions and general insurance areas, LISS automates the end-to-end new business process, from quote to underwriting to issuance deploying a digital infrastructure.

Our Healthcare operating segment primarily serves U.S.-based healthcare payers and providers. We provide BPM services related to care management/population health, payment integrity, revenue optimization and customer engagement directly addressing the market need for improved healthcare outcomes, reduced claims and administrative costs, and improved access to the healthcare system in the healthcare market. We offer BPaaS, SaaS and platform BPM services designed to serve the healthcare industry as well as proprietary technology platforms. EXL’s CareRadius® and MaxMCsm applications connect payers, providers and members with critical clinical information, and automates a payer's operations to increase efficiencies across all aspects of care management.
Our Travel, Transportation and Logistics operating segment primarily serves clients in the travel, transport and logistics industries, including less-than-truckload (LTL), truckload and intermodal logistics sectors. We provide BPM services related to business processes in corporate and leisure travel such as reservations, customer service, fulfillment and finance and accounting. In addition, we have expertise in processing transportation and logistics transactions, including supply chain management, warehousing, transportation management and international logistics services. For companies in the transportation and logistics sector, we provide sales, billing, collection, claims management, revenue management, accounting freight audit and payment and logistics engineering services.
Our Finance and Accounting (“F&A”) operating segment provides finance and accounting BPM services across an array of F&A processes including procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, hire-to-retire, record-to-report, regulatory reporting, financial planning and analysis, audit and assurance, treasury and tax processes. This operating segment provides services across the five industry verticals within operations management as well as to clients in other industries like manufacturing, media among others. We also provide “Operations-as-a-Service” offerings in the procure to pay, order to cash and record to report areas by integrating proprietary analytics, advanced automation including robotics process automation, and F&A technology platforms, both proprietary as well as those from leading third party technology platform providers. 
Our Banking and Financial Services operating segment offers a comprehensive range of BPM services across the spectrum of the banking and financial services industry including residential mortgage lending, retail banking and credit cards, commercial banking and investment management. We have also assisted global banking and financial institutions with improving their operations by enabling clients to identify regulatory and compliance gaps, develop remediation plans and services, and track ongoing performance. EXL uses robotics process automation and proprietary business intelligence tools to innovate workflow management, transaction monitoring, and management information and reporting to enhance transparency in regulatory and management reporting.
Our Utilities operating segment services offers BPM services related to enhancing operating models, improving customer experience, reducing costs, shortening turnaround time and simplifying compliance for our clients. By leveraging our “Operations-as-a-Service” model, we combine domain expertise, customer-centric operations management practices and analytics capabilities with cloud-based billing & customer relationship management platform, digital services (Customer and Field Mobility Solutions), industry-specific products, business process automation and robotics. 
Our Consulting operating segment provides industry-specific transformational services, targeting select industries and functions (e.g., Insurance, Healthcare, Travel, Transportation and Logistics, Finance and Accounting and Banking & Financial Services), where we have developed broad and deep core competencies. Our services are designed to address contemporary problems across the aforementioned domains, embracing the digital & analytics revolution, to deliver business models that help our clients realize their innovation goals and improve their strategic competitive position. We also offer a full range of finance transformation services to the CFO suite, including finance platform modernization and implementation, finance process transformation and digitization as well as governance, risk and compliance support.

Our Analytics engagements span both project work and longer-term annuity arrangements where EXL provides ongoing analytics modeling and services for a year or more. We utilize domain and industry knowledge related to the business problem being considered to support these Analytics engagements. 
In 2016 we acquired IQR, a provider of marketing and risk analytics services to super-regional banks and credit unions. Established in 2008, IQR has been helping businesses across verticals through data analytics and related consulting services by turning data into decisions and delivering insightful quantifiable results. In 2016 we also acquired Datasource, a consulting company that focuses exclusively on enterprise data management, including both strategic and implementation services.

Our Analytics services include: (1) retail banking, commercial banking and investment banking and management for the banking and financial services industry; (2) actuarial, claims, informatics, CRM and marketing analysis, medical cost and care management, and operational effectiveness in the healthcare industry; and (3) marketing and agency management, actuarial, servicing and operations, customer management, and claims and money movement in the insurance industry.
Geographic and Segment Information
Please see the disclosures in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for segment and geographic information regarding our business.
Business Strategy
We are a business process management company providing operations management and analytics services that help businesses enhance growth and profitability. Specific elements of our strategy include:
Deploying our Business EXLerator FrameworkTM in Operations Management 
In servicing our operations management clients, we differentiate ourselves by using our proprietary Business EXLerator FrameworkTM, described above. Business EXLeratorTM has helped EXL win new clients as well as increase satisfaction with existing clients. Advanced automation is another key element where we leverage proprietary and partner technologies to drive operational efficiencies and provide a step-change in the degrees of automation (such as robotics) embedded within the process. 
Developing Business Process-as-a-Service (“BPaaS”) Solutions to distinguish our BPM Solutions
We continue to invest and focus in developing BPaaS and technology-enabled product solutions. We believe we are well positioned to shift part of our servicing model in niche operations management services, from our current model to a BPaaS servicing model that offers an integrated technology platform with operations management services. BPaaS services are typically delivered using a transaction-based or outcome-based pricing model and can minimize a client’s initial capital investment on technology. In addition to existing solutions, we intend to enter into additional partnerships to develop and take-to-market new BPaaS solutions.

Building Additional Analytics Capabilities and Solution Offerings 
We continue to invest in our Analytics capabilities by expanding our solution offerings, enhancing the skill sets and training of our team, and developing reusable intellectual property that can be incorporated into our analytics services. We intend to further increase our investment in our proprietary methodologies and algorithms that help us improve our ability to predict outcomes for our clients to help them capture data signals in a more efficient manner. In order to optimize the way in which we deliver analytics services to clients and source the highest quality global talent, we intend to further expand our multi-shore delivery capabilities by adding to our team of professionals in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, India, Singapore and the Philippines. In addition to hiring directly from educational institutions, we expect to hire additional experienced senior team members in order to deepen our industry expertise and thought leadership.
Extending Our Industry Expertise
We intend to further extend our knowledge and capabilities in the industry verticals we serve in order to enhance our reputation as a provider of business process services. In 2016, we hired a Chief Growth Officer who has primary responsibility for our corporate strategy and our first Chief Technology Officer. By focusing on transitioning and managing more complex and value-enhancing services, we can enhance our capability to serve our clients, including helping our clients evolve their digital transformation efforts. In order to market our base of experience externally, we intend to produce additional primary research and technical papers in order to enhance our reputation as industry thought leaders. 
Recruiting, Training, and Retaining the Most Talented Professionals
We have instituted an integrated talent management framework through active collaboration between our recruitment, capability development and business human resource functions. We deploy innovative methods to recruit, train and retain our skilled employees. We intend to focus on recruiting the right talent and develop them further on relevant competencies through our learning academies, rigorous promotion standards, client and / or industry specific training and competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation. We are able to leverage shared resources across our services, particularly those in operations management, including as a result of our personnel having skillsets applicable to a wide variety of BPM services. We supplement our scope of operations experience with several industry-specific domain academies to enhance the specialization quotient of our employees.
Cultivating Long-term Relationships and Expanding our Client Base
We continue to maintain our focus on cultivating long-term client relationships as well as attracting new clients. We believe there are significant opportunities for additional growth within our existing clients, and we seek to expand these relationships by:

• | Increasing the depth and breadth of the services we provide across new client business, functions and geographies;


• | Offering the full suite of EXL services that includes operations management (including consulting) and analytics; and


• | Supporting our clients’ geographic expansion leveraging our global footprint.

We intend to continue building a portfolio of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in our focus industries that have the most complex and diverse processes and, accordingly, stand to benefit significantly from our services. We also intend to cultivate long-term relationships with medium-sized companies in our focus industries leveraging our BPaaS and technology offerings.
Expanding our Global Delivery Footprint and Operational Infrastructure
We intend to further expand and invest in our network of delivery centers to service our clients. In 2016, we expanded our operations centers in India, the Philippines and South Africa. In 2016, the acquisitions of Liss, IQR and Datasource added operating facilities in the United Kingdom, the United States and India. 
Pursuing Strategic Relationships and Acquisitions
We intend to continue making selective acquisitions in our focus industry verticals as well as to add to our capabilities. We intend to selectively consider strategic relationships with industry leaders that add new long-term client relationships, enhance the depth and breadth of our services and complement our business strategy. We also intend to selectively consider partnerships, alliances or investments that will expand the scope and effectiveness of our services by adding proprietary technology assets and intellectual property, adding new clients or allowing us to enter new geographic markets.

Our Industry
Operations Management
BPM service providers work with clients to transfer their key business processes to reduce costs, improve process quality, handle increased transaction volumes and reduce redundancy. BPM providers can enable organizations to enhance profitability and increase efficiency and reliability, permitting them to concentrate on their core areas of competence. BPM is a long-term strategic commitment for a company that, once implemented, is generally not subject to cyclical spending or information technology budget fluctuations. Increased global demand, cost improvements in international communications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for BPM providers with offshore delivery capabilities, and many companies are moving select office processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations. We believe the demand for BPM services will be primarily led by industries that are transaction-driven and that require significant customer interactions. 
According to India’s National Association of Software and Service Companies (“NASSCOM”), an industry trade organization, exports from India in the information technology and BPM industry are expected to grow at 8.6% year over year in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.
Analytics
Companies are increasingly looking to BPM service providers to provide a suite of analytics services including statistical tools, models and techniques to clean, organize and examine structured and unstructured corporate data. This data is then used by companies to generate specific business-related analysis and insights into their business and prospects. The enhanced generation of business data across multiple formats, substantial reduction in data storage costs, growing enterprise demand for data-driven and real-time decision making and availability of sophisticated analytics tools have enabled companies to overcome a local shortage of specialized analytics talent and benefit from global labor markets. BPM service providers who can develop industry-specific analytics expertise are especially well poised to benefit from this global trend.
We believe the demand for Analytics services in many of our key verticals, including banking and financial services, insurance and healthcare, is growing and will continue to do so for the next several years. According to IDC, worldwide business services spending in analytics was predicted to grow by 14.7%, from a $45 billion market in 2013 to a $90 billion market in 2018. India has emerged as a leading delivery location for analytics, driven by a large quantitatively-trained workforce and attractive cost efficiencies, as compared to other locations.
Sales, Marketing and Client Management
We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting and consulting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the U.S., Europe and Australia and are supported by our business development team. 
Our sales, marketing and business development teams are responsible for new client acquisitions, public relations, relations with outsourcing advisory companies, analyst relations and rankings, lead generation, knowledge management, content development, campaign management, digital/web presence, brand awareness and participation in industry forums and conferences. As of December 31, 2016, we employed slightly over 100 sales, marketing, business development and client management professionals with the majority of them based in either the U.S. or Europe. Our professionals generally have significant experience in business process services, technology, operations, analytics and consulting. 
Clients
EXL generated revenues from approximately 400 and 360 clients in 2016 and 2015, respectively (with annual revenue exceeding $50,000 per client). We have won 40 and 34 new clients during 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Our top three, five and ten clients generated 16.8%, 25.4% and 40.1% of our revenues, respectively, in 2016. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 17.3%, 25.0% and 40.5% of our revenues, respectively, in 2015. We have a limited number of clients in our Utilities and Banking and Financial services operating segments. However, no client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2016 or 2015. Our revenue concentration with our top clients remains consistent year-over-year and we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients.” 
Our long-term relationships with our clients typically evolve from providing a single, discrete service or process into providing a series of complex, integrated processes across multiple business lines. For operations management services other than consulting, we enter into long-term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms of between three and five years. Consulting engagements have typical terms of six to twelve months. Agreements for Analytics services are either 
6

project based or having shorter initial terms, which are typically between one to three years. However, each agreement is individually negotiated with the client.
Competition
Competition in the BPM services industry is intense and growing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We face significant competition from U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based BPM and information technology (“IT”) companies and from our clients, who may build shared services centers to perform these services themselves, either in-house, in the U.S. or through offshore groups or other arrangements.” Many companies, including certain of our clients, choose to perform some or all of their customer-facing and back-office processes internally, utilizing their own employees to provide these services as part of their regular business operations. Some companies have moved portions of their in-house customer management functions offshore, including to offshore affiliates. We believe our key advantage over in-house business processes management is that we provide companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and markets while we focus on service delivery and operational excellence. We compete primarily against:

• | BPM service companies with delivery capability in offshore locations, particularly India, such as Genpact Limited and WNS (Holdings) Limited;


• | BPM divisions of large global IT service companies, such as Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services;


• | Niche providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area such as analytics or healthcare; and


• | Leading accounting and management consulting firms.

We compete against these entities by working to establish ourselves as a service provider with deep industry expertise, strong client relationships, leading industry talent, superior operational and process capabilities, differentiated technology and BPaaS solutions, and sophisticated analytic and consulting capabilities, which enable us to respond rapidly to market trends and the evolving needs of our clients.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property consists of proprietary and licensed platforms, software and databases, trade secrets, methodologies and know-how, trademarks, copyrighted software, operating procedures and other materials and patents and pending patent applications. We have several registered trademarks and logos and pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and certain foreign jurisdictions. We consider our business processes and implementation methodologies to be trade secrets or proprietary and confidential information. To provide our services, in addition to our own proprietary materials we use software and data licensed from third parties, as well as software and data licensed by our clients from third parties and available on their systems. We also use software-as-a-service or “SaaS” services pursuant to contracts with third parties or made available to us by our clients who contract directly with the third parties. In particular, we have developed several strategic partnerships with robotics and process automation software companies to facilitate our offering of automation to our clients.
Clients and business partners sign nondisclosure agreements requiring confidential treatment of our information. Our employees are required to sign work-for-hire and confidentiality covenants as a condition to their employment. 
Our technology group and various business lines independently develop proprietary tools that we can deploy to support services for our clients. We sometimes develop new tools while working on a client engagement and negotiate contracts that often give us ownership or licenses to use such tools for other clients. Clients also engage us to develop new tools and methodologies as “works for hire” that are owned by the clients, but we typically retain a license or future rights with respect to such work product.
Information Security and Data Privacy
We have a strong focus on information security, data privacy and the protection of our clients’ and their customers’ confidential personal and sensitive information. We have made significant investments to strengthen our information security and cyber security posture and protocols to ensure compliance with the established confidentiality policies and the laws and regulations governing our activities. These investments involve ensuring we have the appropriate people, processes and technology in place to protect information throughout its life cycle. 
EXL places significant focus on implementing and maintaining cyber security capabilities to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber threats, incidents and attacks; reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the impact of cyber incidents. We have a strong culture of compliance and a rigorous system of institutional governance built upon and supported by policies and processes, tools and technologies, and regular knowledge and awareness training. 
According to the needs of our clients as well as the regulatory requirements of the geographies in which we operate, most of our delivery centers are certified in regard to quality, information security and employee safety, such as the ISO 
7

9001:2008 standard for quality management system, the ISO 27001:2013 standard for our information security management system and the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard for our occupational health and safety management system. Some of our centers in the Philippines and South Africa and certain client processes in other operation centers in India are certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 3.1 or higher requirements. We engage independent firms to conduct General Controls and business process specific SSAE 16 (SOC I - Type II) assessments.
EXL offers managed hosting environments for our BPaaS solutions in the insurance and healthcare verticals. Clients who adopt our BPaaS solutions on a managed hosted basis are offered a highly reliable, scalable, and secure hosting environment. The technology applications designed to meet disaster recover requirements are hosted in ISO 27001 certified, SSAE16 SOC1 Compliant Tier 4 data centers that are proactively monitored and managed 24 hours a day to meet the client’s business requirements.
We have a robust, wide area network and international telecommunications capacity to support our global business operations. Our infrastructure is built to industry standards, leveraging leading technology providers and partners. Our business continuity management includes plans to mitigate and manage operational risks by building resilience and redundancy in our telecommunications and network infrastructure, applications and IT infrastructure, utilities and power, and trained talent across our service delivery locations.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a headcount of approximately 26,000 employees, with approximately 18,600 employees based in India and approximately 4,600 employees in the Philippines. We have approximately 1,800 employees in the U.S, 150 employees in the U.K., and 500 employees in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and 350 in South Africa and other geographies. None of our employees are unionized. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe that we enjoy good employee relations.
Hiring and Recruiting
Our employees are critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, we focus on recruiting, training and retaining our professionals. We have developed effective strategies that enable an efficient recruitment process. We have approximately 100 employees dedicated to recruitment. Some of the strategies we have adopted to increase efficiency in our hiring practices include the utilization of online voice assessments and a centralized hiring center. Our hiring policies focus on identifying high quality employees who demonstrate a propensity for learning, contribution to client services and growth. Candidates must undergo numerous tests and interviews before we extend offers for employment. We also conduct background checks on candidates, including criminal background checks, where permitted and as required by clients or on a sample basis. In addition, where permitted and required for client services, we perform random drug testing on the workforce on a regular basis.
We offer our employees competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation and offer a variety of benefits that vary by facility, including free transport to and from home in certain circumstances, subsidized meals and free access to recreational facilities that are located within some of our operations centers. Our attrition rate for employees who had been with EXL for more than 180 days was 31.5% and 33.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As competition in our industry increases, our turnover rate could increase. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations, as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates.”
Capability Development and Training
We maintain a strong focus on capability development, with an emphasis on deeper knowledge, specialization and domain expertise. Our talent and learning strategies are aligned to the overall business strategy. This creates thought leaders with high industry acumen who are better able to address our clients’ requirements. We also provide a career -linked learning path to our employees from new hires to tenured employees to senior levels of leadership.
Our domain academies focus on building domain expertise through certifications and specialization. These include our Insurance Academy, Travel Academy, Finance and Accounting Academy, Healthcare Academy and our Analytics Academy.  These domain academies focus on achieving excellence and developing skill sets that can be used across the different domains by the individual participating in a particular domain academy. Our training includes behavioral and functional components to enhance and ensure job readiness as well as also boosting ongoing productivity and effectiveness. We have a global presence catering to the specific learning requirements of each geography. We provide learning through our blended learning methodology comprising of classroom, on the job coaching and technology led learning.

Regulation
Our operations sometimes are subject to rules, regulations and statutes in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services as a result of the diverse and complex nature of our service offerings. More often, however, our clients contractually require that we comply with certain rules and regulations applicable to their specific industries.
We are one of the few service providers that can provide third-party administrator insurance services from India and the Philippines and are currently able to provide such services in the U.S. for 45 states and 16 states, respectively. Additionally, through a domestic subsidiary, we are licensed or otherwise eligible to provide third-party administrator services in all states within the U.S. Certain of our debt collection, utilization review, workers compensation utilization review and telemarketing services require us to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions or require certain categories of our professionals to be individually licensed. Our facilities in the Philippines are accredited by the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”), a leading healthcare and education accreditation organization. We continue to obtain licenses and accreditations required from time to time by our business operations.
Our operations are also subject to compliance with a variety of other laws, including U.S. federal and state regulations that apply to certain portions of our business such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and the UK Bribery Act. We must also comply with applicable regulations relating to health and other personal information that we handle as part of our services.
We benefit from tax relief provided by laws and regulations in India and the Philippines. Regulation of our business by the Indian government affects us in several ways. During the last several years, we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (the “SEZ Act”). The SEZ Act introduced a 15-year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones (“SEZs”). Under the SEZ Act, qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to (i) 100% of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations; (ii) 50% of such export profits for the next five years; and (iii) 50% of the export profits for a further five years, subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements. The SEZ Act provides, among other restrictions, that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment (beyond a prescribed limit) to new SEZ locations. We anticipate establishing additional operations centers in SEZs or other tax advantaged locations in the future. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks related to the International nature of our business - Our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments introduce new legislation, reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry or if we are not eligible for these benefits.” 
We also benefit from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for some of our operations centers established there over the last several years. The Company registered with the Philippines Economic Zone Authority (“PEZA”) and is inter-alia, eligible for income tax exemption for four years. This exemption incentive may be extended in certain instances upon fulfillment of certain conditions. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in the Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate, which is currently 5.0% on the gross income.

We make available, free of charge, on our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, proxy statements, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
