 See Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by segment. 
 Customers and Distribution 
 We sell our products through various distribution channels, including grocery retailers, foodservice distributors, and industrial and export, which includes food manufacturers and repackagers of foodservice products. We have an internal sales force that manages customer relationships and a broker network for sales to retail, foodservice, and export accounts. Industrial food products are generally sold directly to customers without the use of a broker. Most of our customers purchase products from us either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that generally are terminable at will. 
 Products are shipped from our production facilities directly to customers, or from warehouse distribution centers where products are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. We believe this consolidation of products enables us to improve customer service by offering our customers a single order, invoice, and shipment. Some customers also pick up their orders at our production facilities or distribution centers. 
 We sell our products to a diverse customer base, including the leading grocery retailers and foodservice operators in the United States and Canada, and also a variety of customers that purchase bulk products for industrial food applications. We currently supply more than 200 food retail customers in North America, including over 50 of the 75 largest food retailers, and more than 75 foodservice customers, including 50 of the 100 largest restaurant chains. A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 57.7% of our 
 
8 
 
 consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 18.7%, 20.7%, and 18.8%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net sales. Total trade receivables with Walmart Stores, Inc. and affiliates represented 18.6% and 21.9% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company had revenues from customers outside of the United States of approximately 8.7%, 11.9%, and 12.4% of total consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, with 6.9%, 10.8%, and 11.3% from Canada in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Sales are determined based on the customer destination where the products are shipped. 
 Backlog 
 We generally ship our products from inventory upon receipt of a customer order. In certain cases, we produce to order. Sales order backlog is not material to our business. 
Competition 
 Our business faces intense competition from large branded manufacturers and highly competitive private label and foodservice manufacturers. In some instances, large branded companies presently manufacture, or in the past have manufactured, private label products. The industries in which we compete are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products, and many retailers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors. 
 We have several competitors in each of our segments. For sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are product quality, quality of service, and price. For sales of products to foodservice, industrial, and export customers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, specifications, and reliability of service. 
 Competition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers generally is based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do. 
 Recent trends impacting competition include an increase in snacking and awareness of healthier and better for you foods. These trends, together with a surge of specialty retailers who cater to consumers looking for either the highest quality ingredients, unique packaging, products to satisfy particular dietary needs, or value offerings where consumers are looking to maximize their food purchasing power, create pressure on manufacturers to provide a full array of products to meet customer and consumer demand. 
 We believe our strategies for competing in each of our business segments, which include providing superior product quality, effective cost control, an efficient supply chain, successful innovation programs, and competitive pricing, allow us to compete effectively. 
 Patents and Trademarks 
 We own a number of registered trademarks. While we consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business. No trademark is material to any one segment. 
 Trademarks sold within the North American Retail Grocery segment include the following pickle brands, Farmans®, Nalley®, Peter Piper®, and Steinfelds®. Also sold are trademarks related to sauces and syrups that include Bennetts®, Hoffman House®, Roddenberys Northwoods®, and San Antonio Farms®. Non-dairy powdered creamer is sold under our proprietary Cremora® trademark, and non-dairy refrigerated liquid creamer 
 
9 
 
 is sold under the Mocha Mix® trademark. Single serve hot beverages are sold under the Caza Trail® and Grove Square® trademarks. Snack nuts and trail mixes are sold under the Anns House of Nuts®, Amport®, and Goodfields® trademarks. Dry pasta is sold under the Golden Grain®, Anthonys®, Luxury®, Ronco®, Muellers®, and Pennsylvania Dutch® trademarks. In-store bakery products are sold under the Lofthouse® trademark. Other refrigerated products are sold under the Second Nature® trademark, and our jams and other sauces are sold under the E.D. Smith® and Habitant® trademarks. Branded oatmeal is sold under the McCanns® trademark. Certain refrigerated dressings and sauces are sold under the Naturally Fresh® trademark. Additionally, certain mayonnaise, dressings, and sauces are sold under the Cains® and Olde Cape Cod® trademarks. Knox® gelatin and J-Cloth® cleaning cloths are products using these trademarks sold in Canada. 
 Trademarks used in our Food Away From Home segment include Schwartz®, Saucemaker®, Naturally Fresh®, and Cains®.
Seasonality 
 In the aggregate, our sales are slightly weighted toward the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced impact on profitability. As our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products. Products that show a higher level of seasonality include non-dairy powdered creamer, coffee, specialty teas, cappuccinos, hot cereal, saltine and entertainment crackers, in-store bakery items, refrigerated dough products, and certain pasta products, all of which generally have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters. Additionally, sales of soup and snack nuts are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Warmer weather products such as dressings, pickles, and condiments typically have higher sales in the second quarter, while drink mixes generally show higher sales in the second and third quarters. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the second and third quarters due to inventory builds, while cash flow is highest in the fourth and first quarters following the seasonality of our sales. 
Foreign Operations and Geographic Information 
 Foreign sales information is set forth in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Raw Materials and Supplies 
 Our raw materials consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our operations include soybean oil, corn and corn syrup, nuts (cashews, peanuts, pecans, and almonds), palm oil, coconut oil, wheat (including durum wheat), sugar, tomatoes, oats, rice, casein, cheese, eggs, non-fat dry milk, cocoa, coffee, tea, cucumbers, peppers, processed meats, and fruit. These ingredients are generally purchased under supply contracts, and we occasionally engage in forward buying when we determine such buying to be to our advantage. We believe these ingredients generally are available from a number of suppliers. The cost of raw materials used in our products may fluctuate due to weather conditions, regulations, fuel prices, energy costs, labor disputes, transportation delays, political unrest, industry, general U.S., and global economic conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The most important packaging materials and supplies used in our operations are glass, plastic, corrugated containers, linerboard cartons, metal closures, metal cans, and composite cans. Most packaging materials are purchased under long-term supply contracts. We believe these packaging materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies can adversely affect our performance, as price changes often lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material and supply costs. 
 For additional discussion of the risks associated with the raw materials used in our operations, see Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7Known Trends and Uncertainties.

Working Capital 
 Our short-term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital and are generally highest in the second and third quarters as inventory levels increase relative to other quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. As discussed in the Seasonality section, as our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products, resulting in inventory builds in the second and third quarters, as the Company prepares for the fall and winter months. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the second and third quarters, while cash flow is highest in the fourth and first quarters following the seasonality of our sales. 
 Our long-term financing needs depend largely on potential acquisition activity. Our $900 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), plus cash flow from operations, is expected to be adequate to provide liquidity for a period of no less than twelve months. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development includes a variety of activities such as formula and recipe development, sample preparation, plant trials, ingredient evaluations, packaging material assessments and approvals, and other technology development and appraisals. These activities are focused on new product development, improvement of existing products, and packaging. Activities are conducted at centralized research and development facilities as well as most manufacturing facilities. Research and development expense totaled $29.6 million, $14.3 million, and $12.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and is included in the General and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, our work force consisted of approximately 16,027 full-time employees, with 13,896 in the United States, 2,022 in Canada, and 109 in Italy.
