ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview of Our Business 
 
We are a manufacturer of new energy high power lithium batteries that are mainly used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) application, and other high-power applications. Our primary product offering consists of new energy high power lithium batteries, but we are also seeking to expand into the production and sale of light electric vehicles.
 
We acquired most of our operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. (“BAK Tianjin”). We acquired these assets in exchange for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that were disposed of in June 2014.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we report financial and operational information in one segment, producing high-power lithium battery cells.
 
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our operations, it has had limited adverse impacts on our operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. We generated revenues of $37.6 million and $22.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had a net loss of $7.8 million and $10.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $184.0 million and net assets of $52.4 million. We had a working capital deficiency, accumulated deficit from recurring net losses from operations and short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of December 31, 2020.
 
In the second half of 2020, we commenced capital intensive construction undertakings to expand the Company’s manufacturing capabilities. In addition, we have been expanding our business by developing new products, fostering new partnerships and launching the light electric vehicle business.
 
Due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government has been providing support to the development of new energy facilities and vehicles for several years. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market. We believe that with the booming market demand in high power lithium-iron products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability.
 
In 2015, to promote the development of electric vehicles industry, the Chinese government issued a subsidy policy named Notice of 2016-2020 New Energy Vehicles Promotion with Financial Support, which regulated subsidies for consumers in purchase of electric vehicles from the central government and local governments. The policy sets forth subsidy standards for various types of electric vehicles based upon the endurance mileage, battery pack energy density, energy consumption level and others, which means new energy vehicles providing long driving range and high technical performance will get higher subsidies. From 2017 to 2020, the Chinese government has gradually reduced the subsidy standards for electric vehicles year by year. On April 23, 2020, the Chinese government extended the subsidy for another two years and the subsidy standards will continue to fall by 10%, 20% and 30% in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
 
In addition, for the purposes of establishing a long-term mechanism for the administration of energy conservation and new energy vehicles, and promoting the development of the automobile industry, the Chinese government has implemented several policies to stimulate the increase of new energy vehicles. On December 26, 2017, the Chinese government issued a policy for exemption of purchase tax for electric vehicles for another three years until 2020. In March 2020, the Chinese government extended the purchase tax exemption from 2020 to 2022.
 
On September 28, 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a new policy named Measures for Parallel Administration of the Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits of Passenger Vehicle Enterprises (“Measures for Parallel Administration”). According to the Measures for Parallel Administration, the Chinese government will calculate and examine the Average Fuel Consumption Credits and New Energy Vehicle Credits of enterprises manufacturing passenger vehicles. If the enterprises get negative credits on the declaration day, their production of high-fuel consumption vehicles will be suspended. The positive credits of average fuel consumption of passenger vehicle makers may be carried forward or transferred among affiliated enterprises. A passenger vehicle manufacturer’s negative credits with respect to new energy vehicles shall subject the manufacturer to compensation obligations and need to be zeroing through purchasing positive credits of new energy vehicles. Accordingly, the automobile makers are required to produce more new energy vehicles or pay money to other enterprises to get positive credits if their credits are negative. The Measures for Parallel Administration became effective on April 1, 2018.

On October 20, 2020, the State Council of PRC issued a new round of “Development Plan for New Energy Vehicles Industry (2021-2035)” (“Plan”), which is a successor to the previously published “Development Plan for Energy Conservation and New Energy Vehicles Industry (2012-2020)”. The Plan admits several key problems facing Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturers and stresses that these manufacturers should be committed to improving their R&D ability, building more infrastructure and promoting the integration of the whole industry. The Plan further outlined the policy and administrative supports that would be given to the industry, and again certified the importance of the development of new energy vehicles for China.
 
We believe these energy efficiency policies in the long term will result in a healthy development of the new energy vehicles market as a whole. In the short term, the extension of subsidies, to some extent, helps ease the pressure on electric vehicle manufacturers and as a result, will be beneficial to the market of EV batteries in China. However, the Chinese government has significantly reduced the amount of subsidies available to electric vehicle makers over the years and we believe this trend will continues in the next two years. Given the changing market environment, we plan to continue to focus our resources on the existing cylindrical batteries for UPS market, temporarily reduce the sales on EV market. We are also researching new products which have higher energy density for electric vehicle market to cater to the EV market demand. We will closely monitor market changes and adjust our operations accordingly.
 
Expansion of Manufacturing Capabilities 
 
In June 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BAK Asia entered into a framework investment agreement with Jiangsu Gaochun Economic Development Zone Development Group Company (“Gaochun EDZ”), pursuant to which we intend to develop certain lithium battery projects which are expected to have a total production capacity of 8 GWh per year. As of December 31, 2020, we had received government subsidies in an amount of RMB20 million (approximately $3.06 million) from Gaochun EDZ. We plan to attain a total capacity of 8 GWh per year to produce lithium batteries for the light electric vehicle (LEV), electric vehicle, and energy storage industries. The Company expects to achieve such capacity expansion through two phases of construction: Phase I is to be completed by the end of 2022 to reach an annual production capacity of 2 GWh. Phase II is to be completed by the end of 2023 to reach the remaining 6 GWh of the planned annual production capacity expansion. The actual production capacity and construction timelines of such battery projects are subject to revision and adjustment based on the market acceptance of our new battery products. We are currently in the first phase construction of facilities, which occupy an area of approximately 10,260 square meters and the second-phase construction is at the design stage. As part of the first phase, we are constructing the production lines of model 18650 battery and 32140 battery, a new battery model as further described below.
 
Further, we are constructing a new production line with an annual capacity of 0.4 GWh to produce additional 100,000 model 26650 batteries per day in Dalian due to increased demands for our model 26650 batteries. We expect that the production line construction will be completed in 2021. At the same time, the Company continues to renovate its existing facilities, upgrade its equipment, add new equipment, improve its product functionality, and enhance the raw materials and components used for production.
 
Development of a New Battery Model
 
Currently, our primary product offering consists of model 26650 lithium cells which account for approximately 50% of our sales in 2020. Model 26650 batteries can be used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) application, and other high-power applications.
 
To maintain our competitive position, we are developing model 32140 large-sized cylindrical “tabless” battery which has passed internal technical and pilot plant tests. Model 32140 batteries can be used in end applications such as light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools and energy storage.

We also announced in February 2021 that we have started the trial production of special 26650 lithium battery, which was designed for application in ultra-low temperature. Capable of operating with high efficiency in low-temperature environments, the special 26650 battery has several use cases in high-latitude and high-altitude low temperature environments, such as energy storage in ultra-low-temperature environment, base stations, transportation, unmanned drones, aviation and aerospace areas, as well as other specific circumstances that require ultra-low-temperature cells.
 
Launch of the Light Electric Vehicle Business
 
On September 24, 2020, BAK Asia entered into a framework investment agreement with Gaochun EDZ, under which we intend to develop light electric vehicle projects. On November 9, 2020, we established our subsidiary, Nanjing Daxin to launch and develop our light electric vehicle business. Nanjing Daxin is in the process of registering its branch in Tianjin City which has eight employees and has rented a manufacturing facility of approximately 4,800 square meters in Tianjin in January, 2021. Nanjing Daxin is currently building a production line at the Tianjin branch to produce electric bicycles. We expect that the Tianjin production line construction will be completed in 2021. Upon completion of the construction of the Tianjin production line, we plan to utilize this facility to manufacture electric bicycles under our own brand and sell them through distributors and sales representatives. We may provide contract manufacturing services to other electric bicycle producers if we can secure such orders.
Trends in End Applications of Our Products 
 
Our business, financial condition and results of operations depend on whether end-application manufacturers are willing to use our products. We target the battery markets for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to UPS application, and other high-power electric devices. However, our revenues derived from a specific end-application have been fluctuating depending on various factors such as governmental policies, technological changes, evolving industry standards and customer needs and preferences.
 
During the period from 2017 to 2019, our largest electric vehicle customers included Dongfeng Autos, Dayun Motor and Yema Auto. Our battery sales in the electric vehicle market have decreased significantly during the period of 2018–2020 as a result of changes to the Chinese government’s new energy vehicle subsidy policies. More specifically, under the subsidy policies, new energy vehicles receive different subsidies based on their driving range and technical performance. New energy vehicles providing long driving range and high technical performance qualify for higher subsidies and the Chinese government has gradually raised the performance thresholds for electric vehicles to receive subsidies over the years. Since 2019, as the battery packs comprising our primary model 26650 batteries were only able to support energy vehicles that qualify for the lowest level of subsidies, electric vehicle producers do not have the incentive to purchase batteries from us. As a result, we had only generated approximately $0.3 million in revenues from electric vehicle customers in 2020. The market where we mainly sell now is the energy storage market. However, we have been looking for opportunities to re-enter the electric vehicle battery market by continuing to develop batteries suitable for electric vehicles and actively cooperating with previous electric vehicle customers in battery pack after-sales service and technical support.

Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:
 

Our Products 
 
The use of new materials has enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, and energy storage such as uninterruptible power supply, or UPS application.
 
We currently are manufacturing the following high power lithium batteries, which can be used for various applications:
 

Battery Cell Type | End applications* 
-------------------------------+---------------------------------------
High-power lithium battery | Electric bus [6,000-20,000] 
 | Electric car [1,500-3,5000] 
 | Hybrid electric vehicle [500-2000] 
 | Light electric vehicle [10-150] 
 | Cordless power tool [10-30] 
 | Energy Storage including UPS [>30] 


* | Bracketed numbers denote number of cells per particular battery. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications
 
End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to uninterruptible power supply application, and other high-power applications.
Electric Vehicles
 
An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium battery’s relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing.

Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or “green” technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells.
 
The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China’s new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. After explosive growth in 2017, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow tremendously in 2018 and in 2020, despite of a slightly decline in 2019. According to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (“MIIT”), from January to December 2018, the production of new energy vehicles in China reached 1,270,000 units - up 43.4 percent year-on-year; and sales in China reached 1,256,000 units - up 61.7 percent year-on-year. In 2019, the production and sales of new energy vehicles reached 1,242,000 units and 1,206,000 units, down 2.3 percent and 4.0 percent year-on-year, respectively. In 2020, the production and sales of new energy vehicles reached a record high of 1,366,000 units and 1,267,000 units, up 10.0 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, from last year. We believe that Chinese electric vehicle market is adversely impacted by the gradually decreasing subsidy in the short term. In the long term, we believe that the Chinese government will extend the subsidy and more diversity policies will drive a healthy development in the new energy vehicles market.
 
Light Electric Vehicles
 
Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles, with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. We believe that he electric bicycle market in China is very large.
Energy Storage & Uninterruptible Power Supplies (“UPS”)
 
Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants. A UPS is a form of energy storage application. A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium battery’s relatively small size, light design and environmentally friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing.
Electric Tools
 
Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools.
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where China’s main lithium battery productions located, such as Tianjin, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products.
 
6

 

We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.
 
Suppliers
 
The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing our products. We believe that there is an ample supply of most of the raw materials we need in China. We are seeking to identify alternative raw material suppliers to the extent there are viable alternatives and to expand our use of alternative raw materials.
 
We aim to maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials to ensure that supply problems with any one supplier will not materially disrupt our operations. In addition, we strive to develop strategic relationships with new suppliers to secure a stable supply of materials and introduce competition in our supply chain, thereby increasing our ability to negotiate better pricing and reducing our exposure to possible price fluctuations.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our key raw material suppliers for battery cells were as follows:

We have registered the following Internet and WAP domain name: www.cbak.com.cn.
 
We also have unpatented proprietary technologies for our product offerings and key stages of the manufacturing process. Our management and key technical personnel have entered into agreements requiring them to keep confidential all information relating to our customers, methods, business and trade secrets during their terms of employment with us and thereafter and to assign to us their inventions, technologies and designs they develop during their term of employment with us.
 
We have institutionalized our efforts to safeguard our intellectual property rights by establishing an internal department that includes professionals such as attorneys, engineers, information managers and archives managers responsible for handling matters relating to our intellectual property rights. We have published internally a series of rules to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right.
 
Seasonality 
 
According to the market demands, we usually experience seasonal peaks during the months of October to December for electric vehicle markets, during the months of May to December for light electric markets, and March to December for UPS market. Also, at various times during the year, our inventories may be increased in anticipation of increased demand for consumer electronics.
Customers
 
Our current major customers include Viessmann Faulquemont S.A.S, ShenZhen ZTS Technology, Co., Ltd. and SolaX Power. We believe that we will continue to increase our revenue and market share as we gradually increase our high-power batteries production as the demand for these batteries has been increasing.
