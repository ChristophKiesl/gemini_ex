(1) | The restaurant counts for Brazil are reported as of November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to correspond with the balance sheet dates of this subsidiary.


(2) | On July 25, 2016, we sold our restaurant locations in South Korea, converting all restaurants in that market to franchised locations.


(3) | The restaurant count as of December 25, 2016 includes 43 locations scheduled to close in connection with the 2017 Closure Initiative (as defined below under Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”).

RESTAURANT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Site Design - We generally construct freestanding buildings on leased properties, although certain leased sites are also located in strip shopping centers. Construction of a new restaurant typically takes 60 to 180 days from the date the location is leased or under contract and fully permitted. In the majority of cases, future restaurant development will result from the lease of existing third-party retail space. We typically design the interior of our restaurants in-house, utilizing outside architects when necessary. We have an ongoing remodel program across all of our concepts to maintain the relevance of our restaurants’ ambience.
Site Selection Process - We have a central site selection team comprised of real estate development, property/lease management and design and construction personnel. This site selection team also utilizes a combination of existing field operations managers, internal development personnel and outside real estate brokers to identify and qualify potential sites.

BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

We have a relocation initiative in process, primarily related to the Outback Steakhouse brand. This multi-year relocation plan is focused on driving additional traffic to our restaurants by moving legacy restaurants from non-prime to prime locations within the same trade area.
Restaurant Development
We utilize the ownership structure and market entry strategy that best fits the needs for a particular market, including Company-owned units, joint ventures and franchises. For each market, we determine whether we will focus on Company-owned units, joint ventures or franchises based on demand, cost structure and economic conditions.
International Development - We continue to expand internationally, leveraging established equity and franchise markets in South America and Asia, and in strategically selected emerging and high-growth developed markets, focusing on Brazil and China. As we continue to expand internationally, we complement our ownership positions in high growth markets with franchisee partnerships. During 2016, we entered into a multi-country franchise agreement for the development of up to 26 Outback Steakhouse and Abbraccio Cucina Italiana restaurants in the Middle East over the next five years. We also entered into a development agreement in 2016 with an existing franchisee in Australia to open 20 Outback Steakhouse restaurants over the next three years. 
See Item 2 - Properties for disclosure of our international restaurant count by country.
U.S. Development - We plan to opportunistically pursue unit growth across our concepts through existing geography fill-in and market expansion opportunities based on their current location mix.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT / INNOVATION
We utilize a global core menu policy to ensure consistency and quality in our menu offerings. Before we add an item to the core menu, our research and development (“R&D”) team performs a thorough review of the item, including conducting consumer research, in order to assist in determining the viability of adding the item. Internationally, we have teams in our developed markets that tailor our menus to address the preferences of local consumers.
We continuously evolve our product offerings to improve efficiency based on consumer trends and feedback. We have a 12-month pipeline of new menu and promotional items across all concepts that allows us to quickly make adjustments in response to market demands, when necessary. In addition, we continue to focus on productivity across the portfolio. For new menu items and significant product changes, we have a testing process that includes direct consumer feedback on the product and its pricing. 
Menu innovation and enhancement remains a high priority across all concepts. During 2016, we introduced a new center-cut sirloin, increased certain portion sizes and simplified the menu at Outback Steakhouse. We reduced menu complexity to refocus efforts on fresh seafood at Bonefish Grill and launched a new core menu at Carrabba’s in 2016. 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The Company leverages technology to support customer engagement, labor and food productivity initiatives and restaurant operations. 
To drive customer engagement, the Company continues to invest in technology infrastructure, including brand websites, online ordering and mobile apps. To increase customer convenience, we are leveraging our existing online ordering infrastructure to facilitate expanded off-premise dining. Additionally, we have developed systems to support our new customer loyalty program with a focus to increase traffic to our restaurants. Investments are also being made in a global supply chain management system to provide better inventory forecasting and replenishment to our restaurants, which will help manage food quality and specifications. We also continue to invest in a range of tools and infrastructure to support risk management and cyber security.

BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

Our integrated point-of-sale (“POS”) system allows us to transact business in our restaurants, communicate sales data through a secure corporate network to our enterprise resource planning system and data warehouse and automate financial and accounting controls. Our Company-owned restaurants, and most of our franchised restaurants, are connected through a portal that provides our Company employees and franchise partners with access to business information and tools that allow them to collaborate, communicate, train and share information.
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
We generally advertise through national and spot television and radio media. Our concepts have an active public relations program and also rely on national promotions, site visibility, local marketing, digital marketing, direct mail, billboards and point-of-sale materials to promote our restaurants. In recent years, we have increased the use of digital advertising which has allowed us to be more efficient with our advertising expenditures. Internationally, we have teams in our developed markets that engage local agencies to tailor advertising to each market and develop relevant and timely promotions based on local consumer demand. 
In July 2016, we launched our first multi-brand loyalty program called Dine Rewards. Additionally, to help maintain consumer interest and relevance, each concept leverages limited-time offers featuring seasonal specials. We promote limited-time offers through integrated marketing programs that utilize all of our advertising resources. 
RESTAURANT OPERATIONS
Management and Employees - The management staff of our restaurants varies by concept and restaurant size. Our restaurants employ primarily hourly employees, many of whom work part-time. The Restaurant Managing Partner has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the restaurant and is required to follow Company-established operating standards. Area Operating Partners are responsible for overseeing the operations of typically six to 13 restaurants and Restaurant Managing Partners in a specific region.
Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partner and Chef Partner Programs - In addition to salary, Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners generally receive performance-based bonuses for providing management and supervisory services to their restaurants, certain of which may be based on a percentage of their restaurants’ monthly operating results or distributable cash flow (“Monthly Payments”).
Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. are eligible to participate in deferred compensation programs. Under these deferred compensation programs, the Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners are eligible to receive payments beginning upon completion of their five-year employment agreement. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or “rabbi” trust account for settlement of our obligations under the deferred compensation plans. Also, on the fifth anniversary of the opening of each new U.S. Company-owned restaurant, the Area Operating Partner supervising the restaurant during the first five years of operation receives an additional performance-based bonus. 
Many of our International Restaurant Managing Partners are given the option to purchase participation interests in the cash distributions from the restaurants they manage. The amount, terms and availability vary by country. This interest gives the partners the right to receive a percentage of the restaurant’s annual cash flows for the duration of the agreement.
Supervision and Training - We require our Area Operating Partners and Restaurant Managing Partners to have significant experience in the full-service restaurant industry. All Area Operating Partners and Restaurant Managing Partners are required to complete a comprehensive training program that emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and standards. The Restaurant Managing Partners and Area Operating Partners, together with our Presidents, Regional Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents of Training and Directors of Training, are responsible for selecting and training the employees for each new restaurant.

BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

Service - In order to better assess and improve our performance, we use a third-party research firm to conduct an ongoing satisfaction measurement program that provides us with industry benchmarking information for our Company-owned and franchise locations in the U.S. We have a similar consumer satisfaction measurement program for our international Company-owned and certain franchise locations and we obtain industry benchmarking information for the international markets in which we operate, when available. These programs measure satisfaction across a wide range of experience elements.
SOURCING AND SUPPLY
Sourcing and Supply - We take a global approach to procurement and supply chain management, with our corporate team serving all U.S. and international concepts. In addition, we have dedicated supply chain management personnel for our international operations in South America and Asia. The supply chain management organization is responsible for all food and operating supply purchases as well as a large percentage of purchases of field and corporate services.
We address the end-to-end costs associated with the products and goods we purchase by utilizing a combination of global, regional and local suppliers to capture efficiencies and economies of scale. This “total cost of ownership” (“TCO”) approach focuses on the initial purchase price, coupled with the cost structure underlying the procurement and order fulfillment process. The TCO approach includes monitoring commodity markets and trends to execute product purchases at the most advantageous times. 
We have a distribution program that includes food, beverage, smallwares and packaging goods in all major markets. This program is managed by a custom distribution company that only provides products approved for our system. This customized relationship also enables our staff to effectively manage and prioritize our supply chain.
Proteins represent 62% of our global commodity procurement composition, with beef representing 56% of purchased proteins. In 2016, we purchased: (i) more than 85% of our U.S. beef raw materials from four beef suppliers that represent approximately 83% of the total U.S. beef marketplace and (ii) more than 95% of our Brazil beef raw materials from one beef supplier that represents approximately eight percent of the total Brazil beef marketplace. Due to the nature of our industry, we expect to continue purchasing a substantial amount of our beef from a small number of suppliers. Other major commodity categories purchased include produce, dairy, bread and pasta, and energy sources to operate our restaurants, such as natural gas and electricity.
Quality Control - Our R&D facility is located in Tampa, Florida and serves as a global test kitchen and vendor product qualification site. Our quality assurance team manages internal auditors responsible for supplier evaluations and external third parties who inspect supplier adherence to quality, food safety and product specification. Our suppliers also utilize third-party labs for food safety and quality verification. We have a program that ensures suppliers comply with quality, food safety and other specifications. We develop sourcing strategies for all commodity categories based on the dynamics of each category. In addition, we require our supplier partners to meet or exceed our quality assurance standards.
Our operational teams have multiple touch points in the restaurants ensuring food safety, quality and freshness throughout all phases of the preparation process. In addition, we employ third-party auditors to verify our standards of food safety, training and sanitation.
RESTAURANT OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES
Our restaurants are Company-owned or operated under franchise arrangements. We generate our revenues from our Company-owned restaurants and through ongoing royalties from our franchised restaurants and sales of franchise rights.
10

BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

Company-Owned Restaurants - Company-owned restaurants are wholly-owned by us or in which we have a majority ownership. Our cash flows from entities in which we have a majority ownership are limited to the portion of our ownership. The results of operations of Company-owned restaurants are included in our consolidated operating results and the portion of income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
We pay royalties that range from 1.0% to 1.5% of U.S. sales on the majority of our Carrabba’s Italian Grill restaurants, pursuant to agreements we entered into with the Carrabba’s Italian Grill founders (“Carrabba’s Founders”). Certain Carrabba’s Italian Grill restaurants that opened or started serving weekday lunch on or after June 1, 2014, pay royalties of 0.5% on lunch sales. 
Each Carrabba’s restaurant located outside the United States pays a one-time lump sum fee to the Carrabba’s Founders, which varies depending on the size of the restaurant. No continuing royalty fee is paid to the Carrabba’s Founders for Carrabba’s restaurants located outside the United States. 
Unaffiliated Franchise Program - Our unaffiliated franchise agreements grant third parties rights to establish and operate a restaurant using one of our concepts. Franchised restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with the franchise agreement and in compliance with their respective concept’s standards and specifications.
Under our franchise agreements, each of our franchisees is required to pay an initial franchise fee and pay monthly royalties based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales. Initial franchise fees are $40,000 for U.S. franchisees and range between $40,000 and $75,000 for international franchisees, depending on the market. Some franchisees may also pay administration fees based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales. Following is a summary of franchise fee percentages based on our current existing unaffiliated franchise agreements:

(as a % of gross Restaurant sales) | MONTHLY FRANCHISE FEE PERCENTAGE (1)
U.S. franchisees (1) | 3.50% - 5.75% 
International franchisees | 3.00% - 6.00% 

_________________

(1) | In addition, under U.S. franchise agreements, a U.S. franchisee must contribute a percentage of gross sales for national marketing programs and must also spend a certain amount of gross sales on local advertising, up to a maximum of 8.0% of gross restaurant sales for combined national marketing and local advertising.

On July 25, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea. After completion of the sale, the Company’s restaurant locations in South Korea are operated under an international franchise agreement.
T-Bird Restaurant Group, Inc. (“T-Bird”) is party to an Outback Steakhouse Master Franchise Agreement. T-Bird, through its affiliates, owns and operates 55 Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California. T-Bird is also party to a separate Outback Steakhouse development agreement, which gives T-Bird the exclusive right to open additional Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California through 2031 and commits T-Bird to opening seven new Outback Steakhouse restaurants in California by January 2022. Each new Outback Steakhouse restaurant that T-Bird opens in California is governed by the Master Franchise Agreement. As of December 25, 2016, no new Outback Steakhouse restaurants have opened under T-Bird’s development agreement.
COMPETITION
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with us in respect to price, service, location and food quality, and there are other well-established competitors with significant financial and other resources. There is also active competition for management personnel, attractive suitable real estate sites, supplies and restaurant employees. In addition, competition is also influenced strongly by marketing and brand reputation. At an aggregate level, all major U.S. casual dining restaurants and casual dining restaurants in the international markets in which we operate would be considered competitors of our concepts. Further, we face growing competition from the supermarket industry and home delivery services and applications, 
11

BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

with improved selections of prepared meals, and from quick service and fast casual restaurants, as a result of higher-quality food and beverage offerings. Internationally, we face increasing competition due to an increase in the number of casual dining restaurant options in the markets in which we operate.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies in the state, municipality or country in which the restaurant is located. 
U.S. - Alcoholic beverage sales represent 14% of our U.S. restaurant sales. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. 
Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws for such matters as:

• | immigration, employment, minimum wages, overtime, tip credits, worker conditions and health care;


• | nutritional labeling, nutritional content, menu labeling and food safety;


• | the Americans with Disabilities Act, which, among other things, requires our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled; and


• | information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud.

International - Our restaurants outside of the United States are subject to similar local laws and regulations as our U.S. restaurants, including labor, food safety and information security. In addition, we are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations.
See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.

TRADEMARKS
We regard our Outback®, Outback Steakhouse®, Carrabba’s Italian Grill®, Bonefish Grill®, and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar® service marks and our Bloomin’ Onion® trademark as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our other menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to the service marks of ours used by other persons in certain geographic areas in which we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.
We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees’ and licensees’ activities with respect to the use of our trademarks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks.
SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, customer traffic patterns for our established U.S. restaurants are generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year. International customer traffic patterns vary by market. For example, Brazil historically experiences minimal seasonal traffic fluctuations. Additionally, holidays and severe weather may affect sales volumes seasonally in some of our markets. 
Quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions, the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening costs, restaurant closures and exit-related costs and impairments of goodwill, definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
