Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading broadband services provider offering high-speed data (“HSD”), cable television (“Video”), and digital telephony (“Telephony”) services to residential customers and offer a full range of products and services to business customers. Our services are delivered across 19 markets via our advanced hybrid fiber-coax network. Our footprint covers certain suburban areas within the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. At December 31, 2020, our broadband networks passed 3.2 million homes and businesses and served 850,600 customers, reflecting a total customer penetration rate of approximately 27%.
We operate our network primarily in economically stable suburbs that are adjacent to large metropolitan areas as well as secondary and tertiary markets, which we believe have favorable competitive and demographic profiles and include businesses operating across a range of industries. We benefit from the ability to augment our footprint by pursuing value-accretive network extensions, or edge-outs, to increase our addressable market and grow our customer base. Within the past three years, we have been constructing our edge-outs with 1.25 GHz of capacity. 
Our core strategy is to provide outstanding service at affordable prices. We execute this strategy by managing our operations to focus on the customer. We believe the customer experience should be reliable, easy and pleasantly surprising, every time. To achieve this customer experience, we operate one of the most technically advanced and uniform networks in the industry with approximately 97% of our network at 750 MHz or greater capacity. 
Our advanced network offers HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint. Led by our robust HSD offering, our products are available either as a bundle or as an individual service to residential and business service customers. We continue to operate under a broadband-centric growth strategy. Based on our per subscriber economics, we believe that HSD represents the greatest opportunity to enhance profitability across our residential and business markets. 
In 2020, we initiated a shift in our offerings towards IP driven services in certain markets through over-the-top trials, in which we offered customers HSD only service with an alternative video streaming option (e.g., Amazon Fire TV stick). Additionally, we launched our WOW! tv+ service which provides IP-based linear video service to our customers. Our new service offers many advantages compared to the legacy video services we have historically provided, including an integrated customer experience for consuming video content through multiple mediums. Specifically, the service includes cloud digital video recorder functionality, voice control through Google Assistant and access to third-party streaming apps. As of December 31, 2020, WOW! tv+ is available in nearly 95% of our footprint.
To further improve the quality of our customer experience and meet the needs of our customers, we continued to enter into agreements with third-party streaming providers, such as YouTube TV and Sling TV, to promote their services alongside our HSD service. Additionally, we made enhancements to our online store and launched a self-installation kit. These initiatives are moving us towards our objective of clearing our network for better bandwidth utilization, providing more desired solutions for our customers and optimization of our customer service efforts.

Our Vision and Commitment to Customer Service
We believe our vision “connecting people to their world through the WOW experience: reliable, easy and pleasantly surprising, every time” is central to our success. This vision influences how we are organized and informs the process we employ to acquire and retain customers. For example, we use a needs-based selling process to recommend products and services that offer the best value to our customers. We keep our customer response activities closely coordinated with all operational aspects of our business, so resources are appropriately allocated and operating efficiencies are optimized. We believe in offering customers an experience that is convenient for them by providing self-installation options for certain services and technician service appointments within a two hour window, seven days a week.
We use targeted marketing modeling to drive profitable growth and minimize risk of non-pay churn. This analysis is performed at the node level in our network so marketing and sales tactics drive penetration in a highly targeted manner. We also believe the responsibility for winning new customers extends beyond the sales and marketing department to our entire company.
We have demonstrated our ability to grow by delivering a strong customer experience and offering a competitive product portfolio that showcases our robust broadband network. We recognize that customer preferences are continually evolving in response to rapid technological change. As a result, we continue to experience growth in customers who purchase our HSD-only offerings. We will continue to evaluate and evolve our product portfolio based on consumer preferences.

Business Services
Our broadband network also supports services to business customers and we have developed a full suite of products for small, medium and large local enterprises. We offer the traditional bundled product offering and have also developed new products to meet the more complex high-speed data and telephony needs of medium and large local enterprises. We offer fiber based services, which enable our customers to have enhanced telephony services, data speeds of up to 10 gigabit per second on our fiber network, and office-to-office metro Ethernet services that provide a secure and managed connection between customer locations. We have introduced our Hosted Voice product offering, which can replace customers’ aging private branch exchange (“PBX”) products with telephony and data service that offers more flexible features at a lower cost. In addition, we have a Session Initiated Protocol (“SIP”) trunking service. This service is a direct replacement for the traditional telephone service used by large PBX customers and is delivered over our fiber network and terminated via an Ethernet connection at the customer’s premise. We have a complete line of colocation infrastructure services, cloud computing, managed backup and recovery services. We serve our business customers from locally based business offices with customer service and network support 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Pricing for Our Products and Services
We employ value based pricing strategies for our subscription HSD, Video and Telephony services. We focus our pricing strategy around our HSD offering and provide the option for HSD customers to purchase Video and Telephony services as part of a bundled service with tiered features and pricing. We believe that our services are priced and featured to meet the demands of a variety of consumers.

Our Interactive Broadband Network
Our broadband network is critical to the implementation of our operating strategy, allowing us to offer HSD, Video, Telephony, metro ethernet, and other enterprise class services to our customers in an efficient manner and with a high level of quality. In addition to providing high capacity and scalability, our network has been specifically engineered to have increased reliability, including features, where available, such as:

● | redundant fiber routing which enables the rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic in the event of a fiber cut;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | backup power supplies in our network which ensure continuity of our service in the event of a power outage; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | network monitoring to the customer premise ensuring the integrity of our HSD, Video and Telephony services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Overview
Our interactive broadband network consists primarily of an advanced hybrid fiber-coaxial (“HFC”) cable network. Fiber-optic cable is a communications medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion. In most of our network, our system’s owned high capacity fiber-optic cables connect to our technical facilities and multiple nodes throughout our network. These nodes are connected to individual homes and buildings by fiber and coaxial cable and are shared by a number of customers. We have sufficient fiber and cable capacity to subdivide our nodes if growth so dictates. Our HFC network has excellent broadband frequency characteristics and physical durability, which is conducive to providing HSD, Video and Telephony transmission.
Our interactive broadband network is designed using redundant fiber-optic cables. Our fiber rings are “self-healing,” which means they provide for very rapid, automatic redirection of network traffic so our service will continue even if there is a single point of failure on a fiber ring.
We distribute our services from our technical facilities called head-ends, hub sites, and data centers most of which are equipped with a generator and/or battery backup power source to allow service to continue during a power outage. Additionally, most individual nodes served by the facilities are equipped with backup generators and/or batteries. Our redundant fiber-optic cables and network powering systems allow us to provide telephony services consistent with industry reliability standards for traditional telephone systems.
We monitor our network 24 hours a day, seven days a week from our network operations centers. Technicians in each of our service areas schedule and perform installations and repairs and monitor the performance of our interactive broadband network. We actively maintain the quality of our network to minimize service interruptions and extend the network’s operational life.
High-Speed Data Services
We provide Internet access using high-speed cable modems that facilitate the connection to the customer home. We provide our customers with a high level of data transfer rates through multiple peering arrangements with tier-one Internet facility providers.
Video Services
Our network is designed for digital two-way interactive transmission with fiber-optic cable carrying signals from the head-end to hubs and to distribution points (nodes) within our customers’ neighborhoods, where the signals are transferred to our coaxial cable network for delivery to our customers.

Telephony Services
We offer telephony service over our broadband network. We install a network interface box outside a customer’s home or an Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter in the home to provide dial tone service. Our network interconnects with those of other local phone companies. In addition, we serve our telephony customers using VoIP switching technology. This architecture allows for the same enhanced custom calling services as traditional time division multiplexing switching systems, as well as additional advanced business services such as SIP, hosted PBX services and other services.
Business Services
In addition to the HSD, Video and Telephony services outlined above, we also utilize our network to provide other business services, including SIP, web hosting, metro Ethernet and wireless backhaul services. We also provide advanced colocation and cloud infrastructure services including private cage or cabinet with high availability power, virtual and physical computing, high performance storage, dedicated firewall/load balancers, private virtual local area network segmentation, disaster recovery to the cloud and backup and archive as a service.
Programming
We purchase some of our programming directly from the program networks by entering into affiliation agreements with the programming suppliers. We also benefit from our membership with the National Cable Television Cooperative (“NCTC”), which enables us to take advantage of volume discounts. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 57% of our programming was sourced from the NCTC, which also handles our contracting and billing arrangements for this programming.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly-changing environment, competing with both existing communications providers and new entrants that provide similar HSD, Video and Telephony services to subscribers within our operating footprint. We have at least one major cable competitor (typically Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) or Charter Communications Inc. (“Charter”)) in most of our markets and our largest telecommunications competitor is AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”). We believe the reliability of our advanced broadband network and consistent recognition for our commitment to customer service provides meaningful differentiation versus our competitors.
High Speed Data Services
We primarily face competition from multiple system operators (“MSO”), fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH"), wireless broadband offerings, incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) that provide dial-up and DSL services, and other Internet access service providers, including fixed wireless and satellite-based broadband services. We offer HSD speeds up to 1 GIG (1000 Mbps) in approximately 95% of our footprint. Several of our competitors, including AT&T and Google, have announced similar offerings in their service areas which overlaps with a portion of our footprint. We face increasing competition from mobile phone companies, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), which offer fixed or unlimited access to the Internet as a part of mobile service packages. These same mobile phone companies have started offering fifth generation (“5G”) services. Due to rapidly changing technologies, consumers will continue to have a variety of options to obtain access to the Internet. 
Video Services
Cable television systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local authorities, which may result in more than one cable operator providing video services in a particular market. Our primary competitors are other fiber and HFC providers, including Charter, Comcast and AT&T U-verse, and direct broadcast satellite systems, including DirecTV (a subsidiary of AT&T) and Dish Network, which transmit signals to small dish antennas owned by the end-user.

8



In addition, our Video services face increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over Internet connections, referred to as “over-the-top” or “OTT”, directly to consumers on televisions, computers, tablets, gaming and mobile devices. These competitors include virtual multichannel video programming distributors (“V-MVPD”), which aggregate live and on-demand linear television, and direct content distributors, which provide and distribute content directly to customers through an internet-connected device for a subscription fee. Examples of V-MVPD providers include Sling, AT&T TV, YouTubeTV, philo, fuboTV, and Hulu Live. Examples of direct on-demand content distributors include Netflix, Roku, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Hulu Plus. Additionally, some programmers, such as HBO (HBO Max), CBS (CBS All Access) and soon Discovery (Discovery +), are choosing to deliver content directly to the consumer over the Internet.
We believe the movement away from traditional video subscription services will continue to accelerate and further reduce our video subscriber base. However, we believe that we are positioned to benefit from these trends as these customers will require a robust Internet connection in order to efficiently access such OTT content, which could lead to increased demand for our HSD services and result in a reduction of programming costs and other costs required to support our Video offering. 
Telephony Services
We mainly compete against wireless, VoIP, and wireline telephone providers. VoIP places and transmits telephone calls over an IP network, such as the Internet, instead of the traditional public switched telephone network. Our primary wireless and VoIP competitors include AT&T, Verizon, Charter, Comcast and Frontier. We expect Internet based technology, including video conferencing, instant messaging, smart speakers, home automation and email, to rapidly evolve to include or displace the need for telephony services. Given the continuously changing technology and various communications options, competition will continue to intensify for telephony service subscribers. 
Human Capital Resources 
We are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our people are the most valuable asset we have. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our employees invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture but our reputation and the company’s achievement as well. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,000 full-time employees.
​
In keeping with our values, we embrace and encourage our employees’ differences in age, color, ability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique. In 2020, we established a more robust and sustainable Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) program, that better reflects our culture and contributes to the Company's strategy. Our focus is valuing the difference in our employees, customers, investors, and vendors to grow our customer base by further leveraging race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, ability, military status, religion, generation, sexual orientation, diversity of thought, and diversity of perspective. A DEI taskforce is in place and a roadmap has been created to support the program into the future.
​
In 2020, we shifted more than 60% of our workforce to work from home as a response to the global health crisis, or COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to place employee health and safety at the top of our priority list. At the onset of the pandemic and throughout the remainder of the 2020 calendar year, we ensured all of our essential working employees had access to proper PPE. As the pandemic progressed, we quickly initiated flexible workplace arrangements, created an employee funded hardship-relief program, and implemented additional paid time off for any employee diagnosed with COVID-19. 
​
We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we structure our compensation and benefit plans in order to attract and retain high-performing employees. We will continue to recruit employees to meet the needs of our strategic plans. We recruit from several major industries for employees with skills in high-speed data, video and telephony technologies. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Legislation and Regulation
​
We operate in highly regulated industries and both our cable television and telecommunications services are subject to broad regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Our Internet services have historically been subject to more limited regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The following is a summary of laws and regulations affecting the business we operate. It does not purport to be a complete summary of all present and proposed legislation and regulations pertaining to our operations.
Regulation of Cable Services
The FCC is the principal federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over cable television operators and services, and has promulgated regulations covering many aspects of cable television operations. The FCC has modified some regulations applicable to our business and is considering further changes, but the full impact of these changes on our business is not yet known. The FCC enforces its regulations through the imposition of monetary fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders and/or the imposition of other administrative sanctions. Cable franchises, the principal instrument of governmental authority for our cable television operations, are not issued by the FCC but by states, cities, counties or political subdivisions. A brief summary of certain key federal regulations follows.
Rate Regulation
The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (“1992 Cable Act”) authorized rate regulation for certain cable services and equipment in certain markets. It also eliminated direct oversight of rates by the FCC and local franchising authorities of all but the basic service tier of cable service. Rate regulation of the basic tier does not apply except when a cable operator is subject to effective competition in the relevant community. Under an order issued by the FCC in 2015, cable operators are presumed to be subject to effective competition. That order was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court, which denied the petition for review. Moreover, some local franchising authorities that could otherwise regulate basic rates for broadband networks that are not subject to effective competition choose not to do so. We are not currently subject to cable service rate regulation in any of our markets.
Program Access‌
To promote competition between incumbent cable operators and independent cable programmers, the 1992 Cable Act placed restrictions on dealings between certain cable programmers and cable operators. Satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators are prohibited in most cases from favoring those cable operators over competing distributors of multi-channel video programming, such as satellite television operators and unaffiliated competitive cable operators such as us. Specifically, the program access regulations generally prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between any cable operator and any cable-affiliated programming vendor. On October 5, 2012, the FCC adopted and released a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Matter of Revision of the Commission’s Program Access Rules (“Program Access FNPRM”). The FCC declined to extend the exclusive contract prohibition section of the program access rules beyond its October 5, 2012 sunset date. The prohibition applies only to programming that is delivered via satellite; it does not apply to programming delivered via terrestrial facilities. The FCC determined that a preemptive prohibition on exclusive contracts is no longer “necessary to preserve and protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming” considering that a case-by-case process will remain in place after the prohibition expires to assess the impact of individual exclusive contracts. In the Program Access FNPRM, the FCC also requested comment on revisions to the program access rules pertaining to buying groups and rebuttable presumptions in program access complaint proceedings challenging certain exclusive contracts. The Program Access FNPRM is still pending.

10



Commercial Leased Access
The Communications Act requires that cable operators make a portion of their channel capacity available for commercial leased access by third parties to facilitate competitive programming efforts. The amount of capacity to be provided depends on the cable system’s total activated capacity. We have not been subject to many requests for carriage under the leased access rules. In 2019 and 2020, the FCC streamlined aspects of its cable leased access regime, including its calculation of rates. We cannot predict how these rule changes or possible future rule changes might impact our business or the nature of any leased access requests we may receive.
Carriage of Broadcast Television Signals 
The 1992 Cable Act established broadcast signal carriage (so-called “must carry”) requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect every three years whether to require the cable systems in the relevant area to carry the station’s signal or whether to require the cable system to negotiate for consent to carry the station. The most recent election deadline was October 1, 2020, with elections to then take effect on January 1, 2021. Cable systems are also subject to must-carry obligations for local, non-commercial stations. We now carry most commercial stations pursuant to retransmission consent agreements and pay fees for such consents. The FCC and/or Congress have introduced or are considering certain rules governing the election process and the negotiations of retransmission consent agreements, but we cannot yet assess the impact of these rules on our ability to obtain programming or on our business more generally. 
Franchise Authority
Cable television systems operate pursuant to non-exclusive franchises issued by franchising authorities, which, depending on the specific jurisdiction, can be the states, cities, counties or political subdivisions in which a cable operator provides cable service. Franchising authority is premised upon the cable operator crossing and using public rights-of-way to construct and maintain its system. The terms of franchises, while variable, often include requirements concerning services, franchise fees, service areas, customer service standards, technical requirements, public, educational and government (“PEG”) access channels and support, and channel capacity. Franchise authorities may terminate a franchise or assess penalties if the franchised cable operator fails to adhere to the conditions of the franchise. Although largely discretionary, the exercise of state and local franchise authority is limited by federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. We believe that the requirements imposed by our franchise agreements are fairly typical for the industry. Although they do vary, our franchises generally provide for the payment of fees to the applicable franchise authority of up to 5% of our gross cable service revenues, which is the current maximum authorized by federal law. Many of our franchises also require that we pay a percentage of our gross revenue in support of PEG channels. These so-called PEG fees vary, but generally do not exceed 2% of our gross cable services revenues.
On December 20, 2006, the FCC established rules and provided guidance (“2006 Order”) pursuant to the Communications Act that prohibit local franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to award competitive franchises for the provision of cable services. In order to eliminate certain barriers to entry into the cable market, and to encourage investment in broadband facilities, the FCC preempted local laws, regulations, and requirements, including local level-playing-field provisions, to the extent they impose greater restrictions on market entry than those adopted under the order. This order has the potential to benefit us by facilitating our ability to obtain and renew cable service franchises. On January 21, 2015, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration of the Second Report and Order. The FCC clarified that the franchising rules and findings it extended to incumbent cable operators in the 2006 Order do not apply to state laws governing cable television operators, or to any state-level cable franchising process. In its Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released September 25, 2018, the FCC sought comment on this conclusion. On August 1, 2019, the FCC adopted a Third Report and Order (“2019 Order”) concluding, among other things, that its franchising rules and findings fully apply to state-level franchising actions and regulations, and limiting the ability of franchising authorities to impose franchise fees and to regulate non-cable services. A number of local franchising authorities challenged that decision in a federal appeals court and asked that the FCC’s rulings be stayed pending appeal; the count denied that stay request but has not yet ruled on the merits of the appeal. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal, or how the FCC’s rulings will impact our business. 

11



Many state legislatures have enacted legislation streamlining the franchising process, including having the state, instead of local governments, issue franchises. Of particular relevance to us, states with laws streamlining the franchising process or authorizing state-wide or uniform franchises currently include Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. In some cases, these laws enable us to expand our operations more rapidly by providing for a streamlined franchising process. At the same time, they enable easier entry by additional providers into our service territories.
Franchise Renewal
Franchise renewal, or approval for the sale, transfer or assignment of a franchise, may involve the imposition of additional requirements not present in the initial franchise agreement. Franchise renewal is not guaranteed, but federal law imposes certain standards to prohibit the arbitrary denial of franchise renewal. Our franchises are typically issued for 10 to 15 year initial terms, but the terms vary depending upon whether we are operating under a local or state franchise. Many of our existing franchise terms will expire over the course of the next several years, and we operate under some expired franchises. Still, we expect our franchises to be renewed by the relevant franchising authorities. The 2006 Order and 2019 Order discussed under Franchise Authority above, as well as some state laws that regulate the issuance of state video franchises, reduce the potential for unreasonable conditions being imposed upon renewal.
Pole Attachments
The Communications Act requires all local telephone companies and electric utilities, except those owned by municipalities and co-operatives, to provide cable operators and telecommunications carriers with nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts, conduit and rights-of-way at just and reasonable rates, except where states have certified to the FCC that they regulate pole access and pole attachment rates. The right to access poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way pursuant to regulated rates and set timeframes is highly beneficial to facilities-based providers such as us. Federal law also establishes principles to govern the pricing and terms of such access. Currently, 22 states and the District of Columbia have made certifications to the FCC, which leaves pole attachment matters to be regulated by those states. Of the states in which we operate, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio have made certifications to the FCC. The FCC has clarified that the provision of Internet services by a cable operator does not affect the agency’s jurisdiction over pole attachments by that cable operator, nor does the provision of such non-cable services affect the rate formula otherwise applicable to the cable operator.
In April 2011, the FCC adopted an order that examined a number of issues involving access to pole attachments by telecommunications carriers, including the rights of ILECs to demand nondiscriminatory access in certain situations, and which attempted to bring the rates that cable operators and telecommunications carriers charge closer to parity. In November 2015, the FCC released another order taking further steps to balance the rates paid by cable operators and telecommunications carriers. The 2015 order was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which rejected the petition. 
Internet Service
In January 2018, the FCC released a decision rescinding various “net neutrality” requirements governing how broadband Internet access providers were permitted to offer broadband service (the “Internet Freedom Order”). As a result, under the current approach, broadband Internet access providers must publicly disclose detailed information regarding their service offerings, Internet traffic management processes, and other practices affecting broadband customers, but are not otherwise limited by federal law in their ability to block, throttle, or prioritize specific types of Internet traffic. The FCC also held that states are preempted (prohibited) from enacting their own versions of these or similar requirements. On October 1, 2019, a federal appeals court upheld most of the FCC’s decision, but it directed the agency to give further consideration to several issues and reversed the FCC’s blanket preemption of state rules, holding that such state laws could only be prohibited on a case-by-case basis, and only when they conflict with state or federal policy. No party appealed that decision. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted a decision reaffirming other aspects of its earlier decision. We cannot predict how a future FCC will address internet service regulation. 

12



In the meantime, several states have adopted, or are considering, net neutrality requirements of their own. Some of these are currently subject to legal challenge by broadband providers and/or the United States government in federal district court. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of these or future challenges, or how state efforts to adopt net neutrality requirements will continue to evolve.
Tier Buy-through
The tier buy-through prohibition contained in the 1992 Cable Act generally prohibits cable operators from requiring subscribers to purchase a particular service tier, other than the basic service tier, in order to obtain access to video programming offered on a per-channel or per-program basis. In general, a cable television operator has the right to select the channels and services that are available on its cable system. With the exception of certain channels that are required to be carried by federal law as part of the basic tier, such as certain local broadcast television channels, the cable operator has broad discretion in choosing the channels that will be available and how those channels will be packaged and marketed to subscribers. In order to maximize the number of subscribers, the cable operator selects channels that are likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. If Congress or the FCC were to place more stringent requirements on how we package our services, such requirements could have an adverse effect on our profitability.
Potential Regulatory Changes
The regulation of cable television systems at the federal, state and local levels has substantially changed over the past nearly three decades since enactment of the 1992 Cable Act. Material additional changes in the law and implementing regulatory requirements, both those described above and others, cannot be ascertained with any certainty at this time. Our business could be adversely affected by future changes in regulations.
Regulation of Telecommunication Services
Our telecommunications services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. Pursuant to the Communications Act, as amended by the 1996 Act, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the facilities of, and the services offered by, telecommunications carriers that provide interstate or international communications services. The FCC has extended many of its regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service to Internet based, or interconnected VoIP phone services. Barring federal preemption, state regulatory authorities retain jurisdiction over the same facilities to the extent that they are used to provide intrastate communications services, as well as facilities solely used to provide intrastate services. Local regulation is largely limited to the management of the occupation and use of county or municipal public rights-of-way. Various international authorities may also seek to regulate the provision of certain services that originate or terminate outside the U.S. As addressed in more detail above, in the Internet Freedom Order, the FCC reversed its earlier Open Internet Order and re-characterized broadband Internet access services as information services no longer subject to various Title II requirements.
Regulation of Local Exchange Operations
Our ILEC subsidiaries are regulated by both federal and state agencies. Our interstate products and services and the regulated telecommunications earnings of all of our subsidiaries are subject to federal regulation by the FCC, and our local and intrastate products and services and the regulated earnings are subject to regulation by state public service commissions (“PSC”). The FCC has principal jurisdiction over matters including, but not limited to, interstate switched and special access rates. The FCC also regulates the rates that ILECs and CLECs may charge for the use of their local networks in originating or terminating interstate and international transmissions. PSCs have jurisdiction over matters including local service rates, intrastate access rates and the quality of service.

13



The Communications Act places certain obligations, including those described below, on ILECs to open their networks to competitive providers, as well as heightened interconnection obligations and a duty to make their services available to resellers at a wholesale discount rate. The following are certain obligations that the Communications Act and the 1996 Act, as implemented by the FCC, place on ILECs, which gives us important rights in the areas where we operate as competitors, and actual or potential obligations where our ILEC subsidiaries operate:

● | Interconnection. Establishes requirements and standards applicable to ILECs that receive requests from other carriers for network interconnection, unbundling of network elements, colocation of equipment and resale, and requires all local exchange carriers (“LECs”) to enter into mutual compensation arrangements with other for transport and termination of local calls on each other’s networks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reciprocal Compensation. Requires all ILECs and CLECs to complete calls originated by competing local exchange carriers under reciprocal arrangements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Colocation of Equipment. Allows CLECs to install and maintain their own network equipment in ILEC central offices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Number Portability. Requires all providers of telecommunications services, as well as providers of interconnected VoIP services, to permit users of telecommunications services to retain their existing telephone numbers without impairment of quality, reliability or convenience when switching from one telecommunications provider to another.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access to Rights-of-Way. Requires telecommunications carriers to permit other carriers access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way at regulated prices and set time frames.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unbundled Network Elements. Requires ILECs to offer certain parts of their telecommunications networks on an unbundled basis to competitors in certain geographic markets at cost-based rates set by the states.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have entered into PSC approved local interconnection agreements with a variety of telecommunications providers for, among other things, the transport and termination of our local and toll telephone traffic. Some of these agreements have expired; however, we continue to operate on the same rates, terms, and conditions in the interim as we seek to enter into successor agreements. These agreements are subject to changes as a result of changes in laws, regulations and technology, and there is no guarantee that the rates and terms concerning our interconnection agreements with ILECs under which we operate today will be available in the future.
Inter-Carrier Compensation
Our ILEC subsidiaries currently receive compensation from other telecommunications providers, including long distance companies, for origination of interexchange traffic through network access charges that are established in accordance with state and federal laws. 
Several of our subsidiaries are classified by the FCC as non-dominant carriers with respect to both interstate and international long-distance services and competitive local exchange services. As non-dominant carriers, these subsidiaries’ rates presently are not generally regulated by the FCC, although the rates are still subject to general statutory requirements applicable to all carriers that the rates be just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. We may file tariffs for certain interstate access charges for these carriers on a permissive basis, but otherwise our interstate services are mandatorily de-tariffed and subject to our ability to enter into relationships with our customers through contracts. Our interstate access services are tariffed and fall within FCC-established benchmarks for such services.
Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the FCC as dominant carriers in the provision of interstate switched access services. These subsidiaries must file tariffs with the FCC and must provide the FCC with notice prior to changing their rates, terms or conditions of their interstate access services. Each such subsidiary has filed its own tariff or concurred in the tariffs filed by the National Exchange Carrier Association.

Regulatory Treatment of VoIP Services
A significant part of our telephony line of business is classified by the FCC as VoIP. At this time, the FCC and state regulators have not classified most IP-enabled services as regulated telecommunications services. The FCC, for example, has applied to providers of “interconnected VoIP” services some of its rules applicable to traditional circuit switched telephone providers, but has yet to issue a ruling determining whether interconnected VoIP services are to be classified as information services (which are subject to little or no regulation) or telecommunications services. The FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding in 2004 to examine issues relating to the appropriate regulatory classification of IP-enabled services, including VoIP services. We cannot predict when or if the FCC will issue a final decision in this proceeding, although it has issued several decisions in the interim applying certain regulatory requirements to providers of interconnected VoIP services. These requirements include, among others, regulations relating to federal universal service contributions, the confidentiality of customer data and communications, cooperation with law enforcement, discontinuation of service, numbering and number portability, outage reporting, 911 emergency access and disability access. The FCC has also established certain other requirements that impact our interconnected VoIP services. For example, the FCC requires that we provide certain notices to our VoIP customers concerning the limitations of the services, particularly in connection with the ability of the service (including access to E911) to function in the event of a power outage. Limited regulations also apply to non-interconnected VoIP services. We are also required to offer our customers a back-up power solution to enable the services to continue to function in the event of a power outage. Within our VoIP line of business, we currently comply with all applicable regulations that have been issued by the FCC or state regulatory agencies. Decisions and regulations from similar proceedings in the future could lead to an increase in the costs associated with providing VoIP services. At this time, we are unable to predict the impact, if any, that additional regulatory action on these issues will have on our business.
Universal Service
The Federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”) is the support mechanism established by the FCC to ensure that high quality, affordable telecommunications service is available to all Americans. Pursuant to the FCC’s universal service rules, all telecommunications providers and interconnected VoIP providers, including us, must contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues to the USF. The FCC establishes an industry-wide quarterly contribution factor, which sets the exact percentage that applies for the given quarter. The contribution factor for the first quarter of 2021 is 31.8% of gross assessable interstate and international telecommunications and interconnected VoIP revenues. The contribution rate is reviewed quarterly and may increase or decrease, which would either increase or decrease our contributions to the USF. This is not materially adverse to our business as we currently choose to recover the cost of the contributions from our end user customers, as allowed by FCC rules. However, climbing USF contributions may negatively impact our end users because they effectively make our products more expensive.
Forbearance and Other Relief to Dominant Carriers
The Communications Act permits the FCC to forbear from requiring telecommunications carriers to comply with certain of its regulations and provisions of the Communications Act if certain conditions are present that make enforcement of the regulations or statutory provisions unnecessary. Future reduction or elimination of federal regulatory and statutory requirements could free us from regulatory burdens, but might also increase the relative flexibility of our major competitors. As a result of grants of forbearance, for example, our costs (and those of our competitors) of purchasing broadband services from carriers could increase significantly, as the rates, terms and conditions offered in non-tariffed “commercial agreements” may become less favorable and we may not be able to purchase services from alternative vendors.

15



Multiple Tenant Properties
The FCC has prohibited telecommunications carriers from entering into exclusive access agreements (or enforcing pre-existing exclusive arrangements) with building owners or managers in both commercial and residential multi-tenant environments. The FCC has also adopted rules requiring utilities (including ILEC’s) to provide telecommunications carriers (and cable operators) with reasonable and non-discriminatory access to utility-owned or -controlled conduits and rights-of-way in all multiple tenant environments (e.g., apartment buildings, office buildings and campuses) in those states where the state government has not certified to the FCC that it regulates utility pole attachments and rights-of-way matters. These requirements may facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in multi-tenant environments, at least with regard to our provision of telecommunications services.
In an order released November 13, 2007, the FCC found that contractual agreements between multiple dwelling unit (“MDU”) owners and cable operators that grant exclusive access to the cable operator are proscribed as “unfair methods of competition.” Under the rule, the Commission prohibits the enforcement of existing exclusivity clauses and the execution of new ones by cable operators and others subject to the relevant statutory provisions. MDUs include a multiple dwelling unit building and any other centrally managed residential real estate development (such as a gated community, mobile home park, or garden apartment complex). These requirements facilitate our access (as well as the access of competitors) to customers in MDU environments, at least with regard to our provision of cable services. They also, however, invalidate any of our existing exclusive access agreements covered by the rules. In 2019, the FCC commenced a rulemaking to explore additional actions the FCC could take to facilitate deployment and consumer choice in MDU environments. That rulemaking remains pending.
Customer Proprietary Network Information and Personally Identifiable Information 
We are subject to specific customer privacy obligations with respect to our telecommunications, interconnected VoIP and video services. FCC rules protect the privacy of certain information about customers that telecommunications providers, including us, acquire in the course of providing telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services. Such protected information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”), includes information related to the quantity, technological configuration, type, destination and the amount of use of a telecommunications offering. Certain states have also adopted state-specific CPNI rules. The FCC’s rules require affected providers to implement policies to notify customers of their rights, take reasonable precautions to protect CPNI and notify law enforcement agencies if a breach of CPNI occurs. If a federal or state regulatory body determines that we have breached the applicable regulations or implemented the FCC’s requirements incorrectly, we could be subject to fines or penalties.
Section 631 of the Communications Act requires that we protect the privacy of our video customers. In general, that section: (i) requires that cable operators, such as us, notify customers of our obligations and their privacy rights; and (ii) prohibits cable operators from: (a) disclosing cable customer personally identifiable information (“PII”) without customer consent, or a court order, except in limited situations; and (b) using the cable system to collect PII without customer consent, unless necessary to provide service or prevent theft of service. Section 631 specifically provides our customers with the right to bring legal action against us if we fail to comply with the statutory requirements.
In addition, statutory protections in Section 222 of the Communications Act, apply to our VoIP services. In the Internet Freedom Order, the FCC returned jurisdiction to regulate broadband privacy and data security to the Federal Trade Commission.
Privacy continues to be a major focus of Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the states. Additional laws, regulations or advisory guidelines could affect our ability to use and share customer information under various additional circumstances.

16



Taxes and Regulatory Fees
We are subject to numerous local, state and federal taxes and regulatory fees, including, but not limited to, local sales taxes, franchise fees and PEG fees, FCC regulatory fees and PSC regulatory fees. We have procedures in place to ensure that we properly collect taxes and fees from our customers and remit such taxes and fees to the appropriate entity pursuant to applicable law and/or regulation. If our collection procedures prove to be insufficient or if a taxing, franchise or regulatory authority determines that our remittances were inadequate, we could be required to make additional payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, safety and health laws, and regulations, including those governing such matters as the generation, storage, reporting, treatment, handling, remediation, use, disposal and transportation of and exposure to hazardous materials, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the atmosphere, the emission of electromagnetic radiation, the protection of wetlands, historic sites and threatened and endangered species, and health and safety. We also may be subject to laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of contamination at sites we own or operate or at third-party waste disposal sites. Such laws often impose joint and strict liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the contamination. We operate several sites in connection with our operations. Our switch sites and some customer premise locations are equipped with backup power sources in the event of an electrical failure. Each of our switch site locations has battery and diesel fuel powered backup generators, and we use batteries to back up some of our customer premise equipment. In addition, some of our sites may have potential contamination risks from historical and surrounding activities. We are not aware of any liability or alleged liability at any owned or operated sites or third-party waste disposal sites that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on us.
Franchises
As described above, cable television systems generally are constructed and operated under the authority of nonexclusive franchises, granted by local and/or state governmental authorities. Cable system franchises typically contain many conditions, such as time limitations on commencement and completion of system construction, customer service standards including number of channels, the provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions, the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds, the payment of franchise fees and the support of PEG channels. We are currently in the process of seeking renewal of some expired franchises. We anticipate that those franchises will be renewed. Local regulation of cable television operations and franchising matters is limited in part by federal parameters set forth in the Communications Act and the corresponding regulations of the FCC. The FCC has taken steps in recent years toward streamlining the franchising process. See Legislation and Regulation—Regulation of Cable Services above.
Prior to the scheduled expiration of franchises, we may initiate renewal proceedings with the relevant franchising authorities. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which the franchising authorities may not unreasonably deny renewals. If a renewal is withheld and the franchising authority takes over operation of the affected cable system or awards the franchise to another party, the franchising authority must pay the cable operator the “fair market value” of the system. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 also established comprehensive renewal procedures requiring that the renewal application be evaluated on its own merit and not as part of a comparative process with other proposals.
