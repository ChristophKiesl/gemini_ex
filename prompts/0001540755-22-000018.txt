ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Anaplan is a market-leading cloud-native enterprise SaaS company, transforming how enterprises across industries see, plan, and drive their business. Powered by our proprietary calculation engine and Hyperblock® technology, our platform lets customers model what-if scenarios, contextualize current performance in real time, and forecast future outcomes for faster, more confident decisions. Embracing constant change, our customers use Anaplan to rapidly pivot strategies, redeploy resources, and optimize plans for growth, efficiency, demand, and profitability. Anaplan equips teams to overcome obstacles and seize opportunities ahead of competitors. 
Our cloud platform empowers enterprises to orchestrate complex scenario planning and conduct continuous forecasting to systematically identify new business possibilities, seize opportunities, and reduce risk. Users of our platform can view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time and across multiple business dimensions. Powered by our proprietary Hyperblock® technology, our platform’s in-memory data storage and calculation capabilities can compute using a massive amount of data in real time and provide a single source of information for planning. This ensures the consistency, quality, and integrity of the data utilized across the entire enterprise. Our platform also allows customers to leverage intelligent forecasting capabilities backed by machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand future market drivers, analyze the impact of hypothetical planning scenarios, and quickly pinpoint areas of risks and opportunities in forecasts. Customers can harness actionable insights from these predictive tools that may help them achieve a competitive advantage. Our platform’s multi-dimensional modeling features enable our customers to plan at any level of their organization, and connect large operational and financial datasets with external market-driven data in a single source of truth to derive finely tuned forecasts. These modeling capabilities provide the flexibility our customers need to plan at enterprise scale and improve decision-making across their business units with any number of users. Our platform supports center-to-edge participation and puts the power of planning, analysis and decision-making directly in the hands of its users with agile collaboration tools, and a highly responsive user experience that spans across devices, personalized views and reporting. Our dynamic platform allows enterprises to break down traditional silos across the planning processes and increases visibility from center-to-edge across their business in ways that can improve decision-making and generate transformative business value. 
We put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. As a leader in connected planning that enables digital transformation initiatives, we have deep domain expertise and have developed a global ecosystem of talent to enable our customers to more effectively unlock the potential of our platform. Our ecosystem includes skilled Anaplan users and dedicated professionals from Certified Model Builders and Solution Architects to Certified Master Anaplanners, spread throughout both our customer and partner communities. We support the ecosystem by making investments in professional developmental programs, including Anaplan Academy, to bring additional Anaplan talent into the market. The ecosystem also continues to grow organically as demand for our platform grows and our customers and partners encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise. By aligning our thought leadership, talent ecosystem, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, customer success management and local sales and service resources, we believe our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers’ connected planning and digital transformation journeys. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing the value of our connected planning vision and driving continued expansion in the use of our platform.
Our customers often initially adopt our platform within a specific business function for one or more planning solutions, but also because our platform has the capacity to transform their enterprise-wide planning process through our integrated planning and forecasting tools and as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. We use a “land and expand” sales strategy to capitalize on this potential. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial solution, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform to customers increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform.
As of January 31, 2022, over 1,900 customers were using our platform. The success of our “land and expand” strategy is validated by the expansion we have experienced in the use of our platform by our largest 
Table of Contents

customers and by our dollar-based net expansion rates. Our top 25 customers by average annual recurring revenue as of January 31, 2022 had average annual recurring revenue of approximately $5.0 million, compared to the average annual recurring revenue represented by their initial purchase of approximately $0.4 million. In addition, our annual dollar-based net expansion rate for Anaplan was 118%, 114% and 122% at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a description of how we calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate. The number of customers with greater than $250,000 of annual recurring revenue was 555, 453, and 353 as of the end of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We monitor this metric, and believe it is a useful tool to investors, as an indicator of the scale of customer adoption and expansion of our platform. While achieving and maintaining incremental sales to existing customers requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts, we believe the introduction of new solutions, features and functionality to our platform, and customers realizing benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, means we have significant opportunities to further expand the use of our platform by our existing customers as well as to attract additional customers.
We have a global partner ecosystem that includes strategic consulting, systems integration, public cloud and technology firms. Our strategic consulting and systems integration partners are an essential part of our go-to-market strategy. These partners promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively or seek organizational change through digital transformation or improved business processes. They also help us scale our sales and implementation delivery capacity globally by leveraging their trained staff, and provide a broad range of expertise to our clients and deep subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases. Our public cloud partners further expand the reach of our platform, extend our geographic coverage, and empower customers to access Anaplan's platform closer to where their users are located. We also work closely with our technology partners to extend our technology platform leadership, execute on our ambitious technology roadmap, and go-to-market jointly with these technology partners. We develop solutions with our technology partners that expand the intelligence, scale, and extensibility of our platform that we anticipate will accelerate customer adoption, expansion and lifetime value. We continue to focus on building depth in our partner ecosystem and expanding the breadth and depth of resources within our partners.

•Drive New Customer Acquisition.    While we have enjoyed customer growth, we believe we are still in the early stages of penetrating our addressable market. We strive to make our platform the preferred planning platform for enterprises seeking digital transformation. We believe these customers have the largest addressable market of potential users and face the most complex planning challenges. As companies across the globe are digitizing their business processes and maturing their digital transformation efforts, they are trying to be more efficient in managing their resources and we believe increasingly are finding value in our platform to drive large scale digital transformation of the enterprise planning process.

We seek to deliver strategic value to the C-suite with the ability to provide a line-of-sight from center-to-edge by connecting every function, asset, capacity, risk and resource across the enterprise which creates a dynamic view of financial implications and guides better business outcomes. We utilize our implementation and technology partner ecosystem to provide leverage to our sales team in targeting and selling our platform to enterprise customers.
•Expand within Existing Customers.    We aim to drive integrated planning across the entire organization to help our customers benefit from the full value of our platform. Our platform is often initially adopted within a specific line of business, including in finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, human resources, and operations, for one or more planning use cases. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies as they continue unlocking the agile enterprise planning and operating model across functional boundaries. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform.

applications. These software companies have offered, and may continue to offer, new applications through acquisitions or organic development that more directly compete with some of our many individual use cases. We also compete with vendors of point solution applications focused on a specific department or use case, such as sales performance management, financial planning, and supply chain planning. We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom may be our current technology partners.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
Technology and platform capabilities, including:
•enterprise-grade scalability;
•breadth of capabilities within a single modeling environment;

We believe that we are competitive with respect to each of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights while actively working to increase our patent portfolio. As of January 31, 2022, we had seven issued U.S. patents that expire between November 2030 and November 2041. We pursue the registration and enforcement of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We also actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company. Our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We control access to and use of our proprietary and confidential technology, documentation and other information through internal and external controls. We require our employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information.

Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Because we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.
Data privacy and security have become significant issues in the U.S. and in many other countries where our platform is available. Laws, rules, and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, data residency, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol addresses. In the U.S., these include laws, rules, and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. Interpretation of, and costs of compliance with, these laws, rules, and regulations and their application to our platform and services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.
Further, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, subject to change and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Examples of recent changes to privacy and security laws that could impact our business include the following:
•The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) came into effect on January 1, 2020, and broadly defines personal information, extends expanded privacy rights and protections to California residents, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. In November 2020, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) which will significantly amend the CCPA effective January 2023.
•On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into effect in the European Union (“EU”). The GDPR includes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and gave EU data protection authorities the power to impose significant sanctions for actual or alleged violations of the GDPR. Actual or alleged violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects.
•The United Kingdom formally completed its withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, in a process known as “Brexit”. The United Kingdom has enacted a Data Protection Act that substantially implemented the GDPR. However, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the future regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
•On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“ECJ”), invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program on the grounds that Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. While our use of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“Model Clauses”) provides an alternative to the Privacy Shield framework for authorized transfers of certain EU-U.S. data flows, the use of Model Clauses to protect data exports between the EU and the U.S. is itself subject to ongoing legal challenges, which may result in a ruling that these industry-standard measures that we, and other companies, have relied on would no longer be sufficient. Moreover, we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EU to the U.S.
•On June 4, 2021, the European Commission approved the new EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“EU Model Clauses”) as mechanisms for lawful transfer of EU personal data to the United States and other countries. The United Kingdom Information Commissioner’s Office intends to issue its own set of model clauses in 2022 for restricted transfers of personal data made from the U.K. The U.K. model clauses and EU Model Clauses impose additional obligations and requirements with respect to the transfer of personal data from Europe to other jurisdictions, which may increase the legal risks and liabilities, and result in material increased compliance and operational costs.

the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.”
