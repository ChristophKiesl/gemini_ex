ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc. (“Intellinetics”), is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with a single operating subsidiary, Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Intellinetics Ohio,” together with Intellinetics, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization.
 
The Company is a document solutions software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. The Company’s software platform allows customers to capture and manage all documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and all digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. The Company’s solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the processes they drive by making them easy to find, secure and compliant.
 
Customers obtain use of the Company’s software by either purchasing for installation onto their equipment, referred to as a “premise” model, or by accessing the platform via the Internet, referred to as a “cloud-based” or “software as a service” (“SaaS”) model. The Company anticipates that the provision of “cloud” application services, or SaaS cloud-based customer activation, will increase over time and become a growing priority in the market and is the most significant strategic part of its revenue growth opportunity.

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has a multi-channel sales model that includes both direct to customer sales and sales through reseller partners or “resellers.” Our marketing efforts focus on generating sales leads primarily through the use of channel partnerships. To a lesser extent, we use our direct sales force and trade shows, as well as our website featuring solution overviews, case studies, white papers, and customer testimonials. We focus our sales efforts toward a much greater percentage of sales through intermediaries, such as software resellers and multi-function device resellers, rather than through direct sales. We developed marketing programs with resellers that facilitate their selling and support of our software solutions. We refer to these resellers as our “channel partners.” For purposes of this section, a channel partner is a company that we partner with to market and sell our products and technologies. We are committed to offering a best-in-class channel partner program serving mid-market customers in both the public and private sectors. In 2016, we continued our efforts on building the support infrastructure required to compete more efficiently using a channel partner strategy. A milestone was achieved in 2016 with the launch of IntelliCloudTM University, an on-line training resource for our channel partners.
Competition and Market Position
 
The market for our products is competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the document solutions markets evolve and potentially consolidate. We believe our primary competitors in our market, the small-to-medium business (SMB) sector, are DocuWare, Square 9, and M-files. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training, and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
 
We believe that Intellinetics has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium business market. In our view, Intellinetics will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that Intellinetics will benefit from four specific advantages already in place:



● | Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow solutions targeting SMB buyers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Intel-enabled solution packaging and customer activation model; 
● | Industry-first integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and 
● | Proprietary AuditShield compliance management module as a standard platform feature providing SMB buyers, for the first time, with a simple way to know if documents required by law or policy are missing. 

 
We believe, with these competitive strengths, that Intellinetics is well positioned as a cloud-based managed document services provider for the small-to-medium business sector.
 
Customers
 
Revenues from the Company’s services to a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of the Company’s total revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s two largest customers, Franklin County Data Center, a direct end user, and Tiburon, Inc., a reseller, accounted for approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues for that period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company’s two largest customers, Tiburon, Inc., a reseller, and Washington State Patrol, a direct end user, accounted for approximately 10% and 5%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues for that period.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, government contracts represented approximately 40% and 42% of the Company’s net revenues, respectively. A significant portion of the Company’s sales to resellers represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically less than 18 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration.

Intellectual Property
 
Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.
 
While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.
Research and Development
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. Recent examples of significant trends in the software industry include cloud computing, mobility, social media, and Software as a Service. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We expense our software development costs as incurred. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, our research and development costs were $386,285 and $497,976, respectively.
