ITEM 1 BUSINESS

Recent Status of the Company

In order to fund and conduct our business over the past few years, we relied significantly on working capital obtained from private sales of our equity and convertible debt securities to various accredited investors. Due primarily to our continued substantial operating losses for the past several years, we recently have been unable to continue raising such working capital as needed to support adequately our business plan for future growth. And unless we are able to raise needed substantial additional funding to achieve significant future revenue growth, our current business model most likely will not succeed.

The board is exploring raising more working capital through the issuance of common and preferred stock. We have engaged an investment banking firm that specializes in health care to advise on the appropriate structure and to assist raising capital.

Effective September 18, 2022, the Board of Directors of registrant FISION Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“FISION”) replaced William Gerhauser as the Chief Executive Officer of FISION, and concurrent and immediately effective thereto, the Board of Directors appointed John Bode as Interim Chief Executive Officer to serve until his successor is appointed or elected. Mr. Bode is currently a director of FISION and will continue to serve on its Board of Directors. Michael Brown, a director of FISION, was also appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of FISION effective immediately.

The Board of Directors appointed William Gerhauser chief executive officer on November 19, 2021. Previous to this appointment, our management consisted of our four directors Michael Brown, William Gerhauser, John Bode (independent), and Gregory Nagel (independent). Michael Brown served as our principal executive. Joshua Carmona was appointed Director and Chief Operating Officer upon the completion of the acquisition of Scoreinc.com on May 30, 2021. Mr. Gerhauser is the 100% owner of Capital Markets Solutions, LLC (“CMS”) through which the Company was managed by two executives under the terms of a Consulting Agreement between us and CMS. When this CMS Consulting Agreement expired in March 2020, the two CMS executives managing the Company resigned all management positions with the Company.

Over the past two years, we have increased fixed cost cutting measures through outsourcing administrative, marketing and development functions to help manage working capital. At this time, we also no longer lease any office, administrative or operational facilities other than a “virtual” office location in Minneapolis on a monthly basis. 

Acquisition to Engage in Medical Ambulatory Surgery Center (“ASC”) Business

In November 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity membership interests of Ft Myers ASC LLC (“Ft Myers ASC”) and ASC SoftDev LLC (“SoftDev”) from Capital Market Solutions, LLC (“CMS”), in exchange for the reimbursement of up to $200,000 of related out of pocket expenses. These two Florida limited liability companies were organized by CMS in the fall of 2020 to engage in the development and operation of a medical Ambulatory Surgery Center and are now wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Our agreement with CMS for this acquisition was set forth in full as Exhibit 10.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020.

CMS is an affiliate of the Company and its largest shareholder, and is controlled by William Gerhauser, a director of the Company. This acquisition and its terms were specifically considered and approved by our two independent and disinterested directors, who also were advised by independent outside legal counsel. Neither Mr. Gerhauser nor any other representative of CMS participated in the vote of our Board of Directors to approve this acquisition. (See Note 11).

Fort Myers ASC was formed for the purpose of owning and operating in Ft Myers, Florida an Ambulatory Surgery Center, a medical facility specializing in elective same-day or outpatient surgical procedures, not including emergency surgery.

SoftDev was formed for the purpose of developing software applications to support the medical procedures and operations of Ambulatory Surgery Centers, including Ft Myers ASC and others. SoftDev has engaged experienced software development consultants and others to assist in the development of its proprietary software platform and other business operations, including Rubicon Software Ltd. We expect to have completed our proprietary Ambulatory Surgery Center software platform applications prior to opening our Ft Myers Ambulatory Surgery Center.

Acquisition of Score

On April 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Scoreinc.com, Inc., a Puerto Rico Corporation (“Score”) and Joshua Carmona (“Carmona”), an individual who owned 100% of Score. This MOU contained the material terms of the acquisition by the Company of 100% of Score including its subsidiaries. On May 30, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with Score, Carmona, and VIP Solutions, LLC (“VIP”), a subsidiary of Score, and pursuant to the PSA, the Company acquired 100% of Score to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Fision Corporation. The Company also acquired certain assets of VIP listed in the PSA. Score is an Act 73 company under Puerto Rico law that is in the enterprise software space and currently provides business to business solutions for approximately 100 US companies in the credit repair sector. Mr. Carmona owned 100% of Score capital stock free and clear of all liens and encumbrances of any kind, and VIP owned its assets acquired by the Company free and clear of all liens and encumbrances of any kind.

For accounting and general purposes, the date of acquisition of Score was considered to be the May 30, 2021 date of the PSA, although the final closing occurred in August 2021 only after a required certified audit of Score’s business operations and financial position was completed and accepted by the Company.

In consideration for this acquisition of Score, we issued to Carmona a Senior Secured Promissory Note for $500,000 substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 1 of the PSA, convertible into not more than ten (10) million shares of common stock of the Company at the higher of USD $0.05 per share or at the volume weighted average price (VWAP) over the last 10 trading days prior to conversion. The Company will also issue to Carmona not later than March 31, 2023 a second, unsecured promissory note in a form satisfactory to the Company and Carmona in an amount equal to Score’s average gross revenue during calendar years ending 2021 and 2022, which will be convertible into not more than 10 million shares of common stock of the Company at USD $0.20 per share and will contain the usual and customary protections and adjustments for future corporate actions, including but not limited to pricing adjustments for reverse stock splits. We also appointed Carmona as a member of our Board of Directors and as our Chief Operating Officer. His sole compensation for these management services will be $50,000 per year paid at $12,500 quarterly in shares of restricted common stock of Fision as determined by the closing stock price on the last trading day of each calendar quarter.

Background.

FISION Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 2010 under a former name, and conducted no active business operations until December 2015 when the Company merged with Fision Holdings, Inc., (“Minnesota Fision”) an operating Minnesota corporation based in Minneapolis. As a result of this 2015 Merger, Fision Holdings, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and control of the Company was acquired by the pre-merger shareholders of Fision Holdings, Inc.

In connection with this 2015 Merger, we issued an aggregate of 28,845,090 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Minnesota Fision, and also issued derivative securities to holders of Minnesota Fision outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,868,575 additional shares of our common stock. As a result of this 2015 Merger, our pre-merger shareholders plus holders of our pre-merger derivative securities held less than five percent (5%) of our total combined post-merger outstanding common stock plus reserved common stock for all derivative securities. The 2015 Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization. Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, our Minnesota Fision subsidiary was the acquirer, and the Delaware parent was the acquired company.

When used in this report, the terms “the Company,” “Fision,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to FISION Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned operating subsidiary Fision Holdings, Inc., a Minnesota corporation.

Termination of Continuity Logic Merger and Subsequent Settlement- In late 2018 the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Continuity Logic, L.L.C., a New Jersey limited liability company (the “Continuity Logic Merger”) to effect a merger which would have resulted in our shareholders as a group and the equity holders of Continuity Logic as a group each owning 50% of the post-merger combined companies. A key provision of this Continuity Logic Merger provided that the parties and their representatives were required to raise enough working capital to support the post-merger funding requirements of the combined companies, and also that the merger be completed by December 31, 2018. Accordingly, in February 2019 Continuity Logic terminated this merger since it was not consummated by December 31, 2018. The Company no longer has any relationship or involvement with the business or future prospects of Continuity Logic.

While the Continuity Logic Merger was pending, the Company made various bridge loans to Continuity Logic for working capital, of which a total balance of $905,500 has been long overdue and is still outstanding. These loans matured on August 31, 2019, bear interest at 6% per annum, and a substantial portion of the Notes is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest on the accounts receivable of Continuity Logic. The termination of the Continuity Logic Merger did not change or affect the continuing obligation of Continuity Logic to satisfy the payment of these loans to the Company. The Company took a reserve as of December 31, 2019 of the entire $905,500 plus accrued interest against the balance of these notes receivables.

Under a court approved settlement agreement dated June 28, 2021, which Continuity Logic LLC has satisfied its obligations within the time periods specified in the settlement agreement and made payments totaling $567,993 for the year ended December 31, 2021, all of which was received in the third quarter. The Company recorded a gain on this settlement of $567,993 for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Continuity Logic LLC was also required to pay the balance of the Company’s unsecured claim plus additional accrued interested by April 30, 2022. Continuity Logic LLC satisfied all the required obligations of the settlement agreement by making payments totaling $431,040 in the second quarter of 2022. Subsequently, both companies entered into a mutual release.

Our Customers – Our potential customer base is global and virtually unlimited, since our software solutions are totally cloud-based and readily scalable, and include a multitude of digital tools and solutions which can provide significant benefits to our customers on both platforms. We have received substantial recurring revenues from our primary customers for many years, and we regard our high percentage of recurring revenues to be particularly significant to our marketing strategy which emphasizes long-term relationships with our customers.

Cloud-Based Platform – Storage and operation of our software solutions platform along with the digital marketing and sales assets and related data of our customers are outsourced by us to reside and take place in the digital “cloud.” Providers of cloud services are typically referred to as “virtual servers” since they provide all digital data storage and software application services to their clients. Our cloud service provider is Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, which leading cloud-based platform offers readily scalable, high quality and secure cloud services capable of satisfying any increasing demand or changing circumstances in the needs of our customers or us.

We regard the hosting of our software applications, the ready digital cloud interface with our customers, and the storage of unlimited customer data provided by our premier cloud provider as being crucial to our operating strategy. Our major savings in expensive computer equipment, high salaried technology personnel, and costly security measures through our use of Microsoft’s cloud is vital to our cost of doing business. Moreover, we believe that our experienced and leading cloud provider is more effective in delivering our software solutions to our customers than we could perform in any event.

Research and Development – The Company has committed substantial financial, personnel and other resources toward research and development efforts and activities related to the integration, commercialization and improvement of the Company’s proprietary software platforms. We currently leverage both an in-house development team and outsourced consultants to assist in achieving our research and development objectives.

Our Industry – We have marketed and licensed our software products and services in the agile marketing segment of the broad software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, with virtually all our revenues derived from our proprietary cloud-based marketing software platforms;.
Employees – We currently employ 11 employees through our Scoreinc.com subsidiary. We currently intend to hire additional human resources in Florida to assist in the administration and execution of our strategy related to the ASC development.

Outsourcing – We currently outsource our software platform maintenance and operations and our accounting and administrative functions to various experienced independent contractors. We believe that the software and other services provided by our outsourced contractors are adequate to service our current customers as required and to maintain our corporate functions in a professional manner.

Marketing Model

During our early years while our Fision software platform was being designed and developed, our marketing and sales efforts were directed toward local or regional small-to-medium sized companies having their operations conducted from one local or a couple regional facilities. Since our Fision platform was designed to be particularly beneficial for and adaptable to large size enterprises, however, in late 2017 we revised our marketing strategy and activities to target and sell our Fision marketing software primarily to large national or global corporate enterprises having many and widespread branches and operations.

Although our marketing focus for the past few years toward large commercial enterprises has been effective in achieving a material base of such significant large customers, we have been unable to generate enough increased recurring revenues from them to support our related increased marketing, operational and administrative costs. Unfortunately, the increased length of time of the sales cycle necessary to close licensing contracts with large enterprises has been substantially longer and much more expensive than we anticipated or had incurred while marketing to smaller companies, resulting in a substantial decline in our revenues over the past few years. And since we failed to close and secure enough large enterprise customers to achieve the necessary increased revenues to support any further material marketing, we terminated all sales and marketing personnel during 2019. We have been attempting to raise material working capital to support a marketing campaign to attract additional large enterprise customers, but there is no assurance any such future funds will be available to us.
