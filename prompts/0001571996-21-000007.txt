ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Business
Dell Technologies helps organizations and individuals build their digital future and transform how they work, live, and play. We provide customers with the industry’s broadest and most innovative technology and services portfolio for the data era, spanning both traditional infrastructure and multi-cloud technologies. We continue to seamlessly deliver differentiated and holistic information technology (“IT”) solutions to our customers, which has driven significant revenue growth and share gains.
Dell Technologies’ integrated solutions help customers modernize their IT infrastructure, manage and operate in a multi-cloud world, address workforce transformation, and provide critical solutions that keep people and organizations connected, which has proven even more important in this current time of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We are helping customers accelerate their digital transformations to improve and strengthen business and workforce productivity. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the edge to the core to the cloud, and we are at the forefront of the software-defined and cloud native infrastructure era. As further evidence of our commitment to innovation, in Fiscal 2021 we announced our plan to evolve and expand our IT as-a-Service and cloud offerings through Apex. Apex will provide our customers with greater flexibility to scale IT to meet their evolving business needs and budgets. 
Dell Technologies’ end-to-end portfolio is supported by a world-class organization with unmatched size and scale. We operate globally in 180 countries across key functional areas, including technology and product development, marketing, sales, financial services, and global services. Our go-to-market engine includes a 39,000-person sales force and a global network of over 200,000 channel partners. Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) offer customer payment flexibility and enables synergies across the business. DFS funded $9 billion of originations in Fiscal 2021 and maintains a $10 billion global portfolio of high-quality financing receivables. We employ 34,000 full-time service and support professionals and maintain more than 2,400 vendor-managed service centers. We manage a world-class supply chain that drives long-term growth and operating efficiencies, with approximately $70 billion in annual procurement expenditures and over 750 parts distribution centers. Together, these elements provide a critical foundation for our success.
Class V Transaction
On December 28, 2018, we completed a transaction (“Class V transaction”) in which we paid $14.0 billion in cash and issued 149,387,617 shares of our Class C Common Stock to holders of our Class V Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock. The non-cash consideration portion of the Class V transaction totaled $6.9 billion. As a result of the Class V transaction, the tracking stock feature of Dell Technologies’ capital structure was terminated. The Class C Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
VMware, Inc. Ownership 
On July 15, 2020, we announced that we are exploring potential alternatives with respect to our ownership in VMware, Inc., including a potential spin-off of that ownership interest to Dell Technologies’ stockholders. Although this process is currently only at an exploratory stage, we believe a spin-off could benefit both Dell Technologies’ and VMware, Inc.’s stockholders by simplifying capital structures and enhancing strategic flexibility, while still maintaining a mutually beneficial strategic and commercial partnership. Any potential spin-off would not occur prior to September 2021. Other strategic options include maintaining the status quo with respect to our ownership interest in VMware, Inc.
Products and Services
We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group; Client Solutions Group; and VMware.
•Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) — ISG enables the digital transformation of our customers through our trusted multi-cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure. ISG works with customers in the area of hybrid cloud deployment with the goal of simplifying, streamlining, and automating cloud operations. ISG solutions are built for multi-cloud environments and are optimized to run cloud native workloads in both public and private clouds, as well as traditional on-premise workloads.
Our comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (such as all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms and software-defined solutions). We have simplified our storage portfolio to ensure that we deliver the technology needed for our customers’ digital transformation. We continue to make enhancements to our storage solutions offerings and expect that these offerings, including our new PowerStore storage array released in May 2020, will drive long-term improvements in the business. Our server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers, optimized for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. Our networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. Our strengths in server, storage, and virtualization software solutions enable us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, allowing our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by acquiring scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.
Approximately half of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan region (“APJ”).
•Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) — CSG includes branded hardware (such as desktops, workstations, and notebooks) and branded peripherals (such as displays and projectors), as well as third-party software and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers’ needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. In addition to our traditional hardware business, we have a portfolio of thin client offerings that we believe will allow us to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. For our customers that are seeking to simplify client lifecycle management, Dell PC as a Service offering combines hardware, software, lifecycle services, and financing into one all-encompassing solution that provides predictable pricing per seat per month. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services.
Approximately half of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.
•VMware — The VMware reportable segment (“VMware”) reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies. VMware works with customers in the areas of hybrid and multi-cloud, modern applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces, helping customers manage their IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. VMware’s portfolio supports and addresses the key IT priorities of customers: accelerating their cloud journey, migrating and modernizing their applications, empowering digital workspaces, transforming networking, and embracing intrinsic security. VMware enables its customers to digitally transform their operations as they ready their applications, infrastructure, and employees for constantly evolving business needs.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2020, VMware, Inc. completed the acquisition of Carbon Black, Inc. (“Carbon Black”), a developer of cloud-native endpoint protection. 
On December 30, 2019, VMware, Inc. completed its acquisition of Pivotal Software, Inc. (“Pivotal”). Before the transaction, Pivotal was a majority-owned subsidiary of Dell Technologies through EMC and VMware, Inc. Pivotal provides a leading cloud-native platform that makes software development and IT operations a strategic advantage for 
customers. Pivotal’s cloud-native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying, and operating new cloud-native applications, and modernizing legacy applications. With the acquisition, which aligns key software assets, VMware, Inc. builds on a comprehensive development platform with Kubernetes.
The purchase of the controlling interest in Pivotal from Dell Technologies was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. This transaction required retrospective combination of the VMware, Inc. and Pivotal entities for all periods presented, as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control on the date of the EMC merger transaction in September 2016. Dell Technologies now reports Pivotal results within the VMware reportable segment, and the historical segment results were recast to reflect this change. Pivotal results were previously reported within Other businesses. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for the recast of segment results.
Approximately half of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States. 
Our other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”), Virtustream, and Boomi, each of which is majority-owned by Dell Technologies. These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments.
•Secureworks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyberattacks. The solutions offered by Secureworks enable organizations of varying size and complexity to fortify their cyber defenses to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in near real time, prioritize and respond rapidly to security incidents, and predict emerging threats.
•Virtustream offers cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions that enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments.
•Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate and workflow is reliable.
On February 18, 2020, Dell Technologies announced its entry into a definitive agreement with a consortium of investors to sell RSA Security, which provides cybersecurity solutions. On September 1, 2020, the parties closed the transaction. At the completion of the sale, we received total cash consideration of approximately $2.082 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $338 million. The Company ultimately recorded a $21 million loss net of taxes. The transaction is intended to further simplify our product portfolio and corporate structure. Prior to the divestiture, RSA Security’s operating results were included within Other businesses.
We believe the collaboration, innovation, and coordination of the operations and strategies across all segments of our business, as well as our differentiated go-to-market model, will continue to drive revenue synergies. Through our coordinated research and development activities, we are able to jointly engineer leading innovative solutions that incorporate the distinct set of hardware, software, and services across all segments of our business.
See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about our reportable segments. 
See “Part II — Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Business Unit Results” for a discussion of our reportable segment operating results.
Dell Financial Services
DFS supports our businesses by offering and arranging various financing options and services for our customers primarily in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product, software, and services solutions. We also arrange financing for some of our customers in various countries where DFS does not currently operate as a captive. DFS further strengthens our customer relationships through its flexible consumption models, which enable us to offer our customers the option to pay over time and, in certain cases, based on utilization, provide them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements. The 
results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Research and Development
We focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to product design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products. Our team of software engineers is focused on developing the next generation of solutions for new and innovative technologies. Most of our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures represent costs to develop the software that powers our solutions. This software simplifies the complex through automation, increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. We manage our R&D spending by targeting those innovations and solutions that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. Our customer base includes a growing number of service providers, such as cloud service providers, software-as-a-service companies, consumer webtech providers, and telecommunications companies. These service providers turn to Dell Technologies for our advanced solutions that enable efficient service delivery at cloud scale. Through our collaborative, customer-focused approach to innovation, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. 
Additionally, we invest in early-stage, privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies. We manage our investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital.
VMware represents a significant portion of our R&D activities and has assembled an experienced group of developers with expertise in software-defined data centers, hybrid and multiple public clouds, the modernization, migration and management of applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces. VMware also has strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world and invests in joint research with those institutions. Product development efforts are prioritized through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. 
Dell Technologies has a global R&D presence, with total R&D expenses of $5.3 billion, $5.0 billion, and $4.6 billion, for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our mission to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.
Manufacturing and Materials
We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See “Item 2 — Properties” for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and enhancing our world-class supply chain.
Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers.
Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, software, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes most of our global sites that design, manufacture, and service our products. 
Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ireland are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems and also have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, an international standard for facilities with world-class safety and health management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality and environmental management are among the highest levels of certifications 
available. We also have implemented Lean Six Sigma and 7S (Customer, Safety, Quality, Delivery, Cost, Team, and Green) methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships is continually improved. 
We maintain a robust Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.
We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on a single source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost” for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies’ use of single- or limited-source suppliers.
Geographic Operations
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global presence, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world’s population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. Our expansion in emerging markets creates additional complexity in coordinating the design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and support of our product and services offerings. For information about the amount of net revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States during the last three fiscal years, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Seasonality
Our sales are affected by seasonal trends. Among the trends with the most significant effect on our operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. government) generally are stronger in our third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are often weaker in our third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during our fourth fiscal quarter.
Competition 
We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing and solutions trends, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and other macroeconomic factors.
We also face competition from non-traditional IT companies such as cloud service providers, also known as hyperscalers, that buy their infrastructure directly from original design manufacturers. Competitive pressures could increase if customers choose to move application workloads to cloud service providers away from traditional or private data centers.
The markets in which we compete are comprised of large and small companies across all areas of our business. We believe that new businesses will continue to enter these markets and develop technologies that, if commercialized, may compete with our products and services. Moreover, current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, which may further increase the competitive pressures. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry” for information about our competitive risks. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. Our unified global sales and marketing team creates a sales organization that is customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. Our customers include large global and national enterprises, public institutions that include government, educational institutions, healthcare organizations, and law enforcement agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. 
Go-to-market strategy — We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales channels, which include value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We continue to pursue our direct business strategy, which emphasizes direct communication with customers, thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customer groups. In addition to our direct business model, we rely on our network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers. The Dell Technologies partner program contributes to the development of channel sales by providing appropriate incentives for revenue generation. We also provide our channel partners access to third-party financing to help manage their working capital. We believe that building long-term relationships with our channel partners enhances our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience. During Fiscal 2021, our other sales channels contributed over 50% of our net revenue. 
Large enterprises and public institutions  — For large enterprises and public institutions, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, position the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.
Small and medium-sized business and consumers — We market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers’ needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. We also engage with customers through our social media communities on our website and in external social media channels.
Product Backlog
Product backlog represents the value of unfulfilled manufacturing orders. Our business model generally gives us the ability to optimize product backlog at any point in time, for example, expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders toward products that have shorter lead times. Because product backlog at any point in time may not result in the generation of any predictable amount of net revenue in any subsequent period, we do not believe product backlog to be a meaningful indicator of future net revenue. Product backlog is included as a component of remaining performance obligation to the extent we determine that the manufacturing orders are non-cancelable.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
As of January 29, 2021, we held a worldwide portfolio of 21,876 granted patents and 10,108 pending patent applications. Of those, VMware, Inc. held 5,230 granted patents and 3,154 pending patent applications. We continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities. The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system and software products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies. We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents. Although we use our patented inventions and license some of them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our product and process patents may establish barriers to entry, and we anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will continue to be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry.
We have used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and copyrights in the United States and in other countries. We believe that Dell Technologies, DELL, Dell EMC, VMware, Alienware, Secureworks, Pivotal, and Virtustream word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations.
We have entered into software licensing agreements with other companies. We also license certain technology and intellectual property from third parties for use in our offerings and processes, and license some of our technologies and intellectual property to third parties. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. 
Our operations are subject to environmental and safety regulations in all areas in which we conduct business. Product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to climate change laws and regulations, materials composition, sourcing, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion, and other substances. The costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2021.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs, economic sanctions laws, and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.
We are subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
Social Impact and Sustainability
Dell Technologies is committed to driving human progress by putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for people and the planet.  All of our stakeholders — shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and communities, as well as the environment and society — are essential to our business. 
Dell Technologies launched its Social Impact Plan for 2030 (the “2030 Plan”) in November 2019. Our goals under the 2030 Plan represent an extension of our purpose as a company — to create technologies that drive human progress. We are using these goals to build our social impact strategies over the next decade. The 2030 Plan has four critical areas of focus:
    Advancing Sustainability — We believe we have a responsibility to protect and enrich our planet together with our customers, suppliers, and communities. Dell Technologies will continue working across our business ecosystem, valuing natural resources and minimizing our impact. With the power of our global supply chain, Dell Technologies has the scale and responsibility to drive the highest standards of sustainability and ethical practices.
    Cultivating Inclusion — We view diversity and inclusion as a business imperative that will enable us to build and empower our future workforce. It is essential that our workforce be fully representative of the diversity in our global customer base. Diversity of leadership increases innovation and ensures that company decisions reflect a wide variety of perspectives.
    Transforming Lives — We believe our scale, support, and the innovative application of our portfolio can play an important role in addressing complex societal challenges, including improving health, education, and economic opportunities for the underserved. We endeavor to harness the power of technology to create a future that is capable of fully realizing human potential. 
    Upholding Ethics and Privacy — Ethics and privacy play a critical role in establishing a strong foundation for positive social impact. We will continue to invest in our advanced privacy governance and risk-management technology. And we will continue to select, evaluate, and do business with third parties who share our level of dedication to privacy.
Dell Technologies is measuring its progress against each of the 2030 social impact goals in annually released social impact reports. The Dell Technologies Social Impact Plan for 2030 and annual social impact reports are available on the social impact reporting page of our website.
Human Capital
Powered by a diverse workforce, we create solutions that harness and amplify technology in the most meaningful ways. Our goal is to ensure that Dell Technologies is a compelling destination where team members of different backgrounds feel valued, engaged, and inspired to do their best work. Through our ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts, flexible workplace transformation programs, training and development offerings, and health and wellness resources for our team members, we are striving toward this goal — to attract, develop and retain an empowered workforce for maximum impact internally and externally for our customers and communities.
As of January 29, 2021, we had approximately 158,000 total full-time employees, approximately 34,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. In comparison, as of January 31, 2020, we had approximately 165,000 total full-time employees, approximately 31,000 of whom were employees of VMware, Inc. As of January 29, 2021, approximately 36% of our full-time employees were located in the United States.
Diversity and Inclusion
At Dell Technologies, we believe diversity is power. Within our 2030 Plan described above, one critical area of focus — cultivating inclusion — highlights how our human capital resources are vital to our social impact and long-term success. We are making strides to increase gender and ethnic diversity throughout Dell Technologies. We still have work to do, and are committed to providing transparency into our progress via annual Dell Technologies Diversity & Inclusion Reports. We will continue to champion for inclusive policies that support women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with different abilities, and other underrepresented groups. Our goal is to build a workforce that champions racial equity, values different backgrounds and celebrates unique perspectives by:
•building and attracting the future workforce to create a workplace that is accessible, equitable and attractive to a diverse talent pipeline;
•developing and retaining an empowered workforce to foster an internal community that is engaged, productive and innovative; and
•scaling for maximum impact to develop stronger customer alliances and an external community that recognizes, respects and embraces our shared value.
To serve tomorrow’s customers well, we need more students of all genders and backgrounds studying STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) today. We cannot fill our talent pipeline without closing the diversity gap. As the composition of the workforce evolves, we recognize that companies embracing diversity and inclusion are experiencing
greater innovation, productivity, engagement, and employee satisfaction — along with better business performance. 
Dell Technologies Diversity & Inclusion Reports are available on the social impact reporting page of our website.
Our Culture and Benefits
Our culture is defined by our values. We work and lead by acknowledging the importance of relationships, drive, judgment, vision, optimism, humility, and selflessness — it is part of our Culture Code. It is who we are. Our culture matters in how we run the business, how we go to market, and how we treat our team members. We believe in winning with integrity, and we leverage technology and deploy state-of-the-art tools to assist our team members in applying the principles of integrity and compliance as part of everyday business transactions, activities, and decisions. 
We seek to create a professional environment where everyone can grow and thrive, and provide a multitude of programs to enhance team members’ career growth and development. We offer formal training options, individualized development programs and sponsorship, tools for 360-degree feedback, mentoring, networking, stretch assignments, and growth opportunities. Our programs are designed to empower and inspire team members to direct their own career paths and build a portfolio of valuable skills for success in the technology industry. We are committed to building a diverse leadership pipeline with a broad spectrum of skills, including the ability to lead with integrity and inspire others. We believe our ability to innovate and cultivate breakthrough thinking is an engine for growth, success, and progress.
We also recognize that the workplace is changing, how people work is changing, and the impact of COVID-19 has only accelerated the “do anything from anywhere” workforce. Dell Technologies offers various flexible work solutions, including our Connected Workplace program, which allows eligible team members to choose from a wide variety of flexible work arrangement options that best meet their needs. Work flexibility is part of our culture, and a recent employee survey indicated that team members strongly believe flexible work arrangements contribute positively to our performance as a company. Our Connected Workplace program is now available in 83 countries across the globe.
During the challenges of the past year, the health and wellness of our team members across the globe has never been more important. We offer a highly competitive and comprehensive benefits package, and strive to provide the best choice and value at the best cost. Additionally, wellness resources are available online through the Dell Wellness Hub to help employees and their families develop and sustain healthy habits. Dell Wellness Hub provides a relevant, personalized, and fun experience that is tailored to each individual’s interests in one easy and convenient place, including physical, mental, and financial wellbeing. We further encourage a focus on wellness via regular communications, virtual live and on-demand educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives.
Supply Chain Resources
We manage responsible business practices in one of the world’s largest supply chains. Our supply chain has always demonstrated high standards of responsibility and integrity, and we continue our efforts to drive responsible manufacturing our stakeholders can trust. Our supply chain involves hundreds of thousands of people around the world. We recognize that looking after the wellbeing of people in our supply chain is important and have set goals for our work in this area including:
•providing healthy work environments where people can thrive;
•delivering future-ready skills development for employees in our supply chain; and
•continuing our engagement with the people who make our products.
We support supplier employees at all levels with training on key topics, including forced labor and health and safety, and we continue to work with suppliers to deliver training directly to employees via their mobile phones. Through this program, Dell Technologies covers the cost of developing training modules and shares training costs with suppliers who deliver them. 
Dell Technologies continues to make significant progress to help ensure that we and our suppliers manufacture our products responsibly. Dell Technologies has one of the largest social and environmental responsibility assurance programs in the technology sector, both in terms of number of audits and the program’s reach across the supply chain. Through these audits, we are able to monitor a supplier factory’s adherence to the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. Audits are conducted by third-party auditors that have been trained and certified by the RBA. Audits cover topics across five areas: labor, including risks of forced labor and weekly working hours; employee health and safety; environment; ethics; and management systems. Through our audit program, we aim to identify and solve concerns in our supply chain, and seek continuous improvements to address issues and enable suppliers to build their own in-house capabilities. We supplement our audits with targeted assessments of suppliers when we identify opportunities to drive further improvements.
Dell Technologies Supply Chain Sustainability Progress Reports are available on the social impact reporting page of our website.
