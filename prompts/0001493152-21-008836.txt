Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
MJ Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK: MJNE) is a highly-diversified cannabis holding company providing cultivation management, asset and infrastructure development – currently concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is the Company’s intention to grow its business and provide a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure, including, cannabis cultivation, production of cannabis related products, management services, dispensaries and consulting services. The Company intends to grow its business through joint ventures with existing companies possessing complementary subject matter expertise, acquisition of existing companies and through the development of new opportunities. The Company intends to “prove the concept” profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success as a template for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and opening new operations.
Current Initiatives include:
 

● | a three-acre, hybrid, outdoor, marijuana-cultivation facility (the “Cultivation Facility”) located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. The Company has the contractual right to manage and cultivate marijuana on this property until 2026, for which it will receive sixty percent (60%) of the net revenues realized from its management of this facility and twenty-five percent (25%) of the net revenues from equipment rental. The licensed facility is owned by Acres Cultivation, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. The Company completed its second harvest on this property in November of 2019 and had anticipated generating revenue from this harvest until late Q4 of 2020. The impact of COVID-19 greatly impacted the continuing sale of inventory from this harvest. In April of this year, the Company planted a one acre auto-flower crop, which it began harvesting in late June. The Company successfully integrated its cloning program for 2020, and projects that it will grow approximately 10,000 marijuana plants starting in June of this year for harvest in mid Q4 2020. On January 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Termination, effective immediately, from Acres Cultivation, LLC. Subsequent to year end, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company does not anticipate that it will generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship.

● | 260 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the “260 Acres”) purchased in January of 2019. The Company intends to utilize the state-of-the-art Cravo® cultivation system for growing an additional five acres of marijuana on this property, that is contiguous to the three-acre property that it manages in Amargosa. The Cravo® system will allow multiple harvests per year and should result in higher annual yields per acre. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to markedly increase the Company’s marijuana cultivation capabilities. This facility, upon receipt of required funding, is expected to become operational in the summer of 2021. Subsequent to year end, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will utilize the 260 Acres for its own harvest along with additional harvests under any Cultivation and Sales Agreements. Please see Note 15 — Subsequent Events for further information.

● | a nearby commercial trailer and RV park (THC Park – Tiny Home Community) was purchased in April of 2019 to supply necessary housing for the Company’s farm employees. After the Company’s 2018 harvest, it came to realize that it would need to find a more efficient method of housing and to bring its cultivation team to its facilities. The Company purchased the 50-acre plus THC Park for $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock. At present, the Company’s construction and completion of this community is approximately seventy-five present complete. The impact of COVID-19 in obtaining inspections and permitting has significantly delayed the completion of this community. The Company has elected to cease any renovations or additions at its Tiny Home Community with possible future plans of placing the property up for sale.

● | an agreement to acquire an additional cultivation license and production license, both currently located in Nye County Nevada. On April 2, 2019, the Company executed a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) with MJ Distributing, Inc. (the “Seller”) to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of MJ Distributing C202, LLC and MJ Distributing P133, LLC, each the holder of a State of Nevada provisional medical and recreational cultivation license and a provisional medical and recreational production license. The licenses were required to be perfected pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 453A (NRS 453A - Medical Marijuana) and Nevada Revised Statures 453D (NRS453D – Recreation/Adult Use Marijuana). In January of 2020, the State of Nevada issued a Conditional Medical Marijuana Cultivation Certificate and a Conditional Medical Marijuana Production Certificate. On May 1, 2020, the State of Nevada issued a Conditional Recreational Marijuana Cultivation Certificate and a Conditional Recreational Marijuana Production Certificate. As of October 2019, the State of Nevada had placed a moratorium on the transfer of all licenses within the state. The Company does not know when this moratorium will be lifted, but it expects the newly formed Cannabis Control Board to expedite transfers beginning in Q4 of 2020. Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business operations, the Company has been unable to comply with the payment obligations required of it in the MIPA. On February 19, 2020, the Company received a Demand for Payment from the Seller. As of the date of this filing, the Company has been in active negotiations with the Seller for an extension of the payment terms. There is no guarantee that it will be successful in its negotiations. Subsequent to year end, the Company and the Seller elected to terminate the MIPA due to the Company’s inability to complete all required funding. Subsequent to the termination, the Company and the Seller entered into a new MIPA3 for the acquisition of the certificates. Please see Note 15 — Subsequent Events for further information.

● | indoor cultivation facility build-out in the City of Las Vegas (the “Indoor Facility”). Through its subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC, the Company holds a Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. C012. In August of 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Element NV, LLC (“Element”), to sell a 49% interest in the license. Under the terms of the Agreement, Element was required to invest more than $3,500,000 into this Indoor Facility. Element paid the monthly rent on the facility from December 2019 through March 2020 but failed to make any additional payments. On June 11, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (“First Amendment”) to the Agreement. Under the terms of the First Amendment, the Closing Purchase Price was adjusted to $441,000, and Element was required to make a capital contribution (the “Initial Contribution Payment”) to the Target Company in the amount of $120,000 and was required to make an additional cash contribution (the Final Contribution Payment”) in the amount of $240,000. Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s respective business operations, the Company has not been able to pay the monthly rent. As of the date of this filing, the Company is in active negotiations with the landlord to find an acceptable resolution regarding the payment of past due rent. The Company is currently in discussions with Element regarding the default of payments. There is no guarantee that Element will agree to remit the required funds to bring them current under the terms of the Agreement. In the event that Element fails to make the required payment, the Company may elect to remit a Notice of Default to Element, terminate the Agreement, fund the development of the facility through additional sources or sale the license. 

 
The Company may also continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis markets that can maximize shareholder value.
 
The Company may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, the Company anticipates that it will face competition from these other companies. The Company’s management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in other legal cannabis markets. The Company believes its experience in outdoor cultivation provides it with a distinct competitive advantage over its competitors, and it will continue to focus on this area of its operations. The Company still faces challenges engaging and retaining senior managers.

COVID-19
 
COVID-19 has caused and continues to cause significant loss of life and disruption to the global economy, including the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease, and through business and transportation shutdowns and restrictions on people’s movement and congregation.
 
As a result of the pandemic, the Company has experienced, and continues to experience, weakened demand for its products. Many of its customers have been unable to sell its products in customer stores due to government-mandated closures and have deferred or significantly reduced orders for the Company’s products. The Company expects these trends to continue until such closures are significantly curtailed or lifted. In addition, the pandemic has reduced foot traffic in the stores where its products are sold that remain open, and the global economic impact of the pandemic has temporarily reduced consumer demand for its products as they focus on purchasing essential goods.
 
Given these factors, the Company anticipates that the greatest impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 occurred in the second and third quarters which resulted in a significant net sales decline in its quarterly results.
 
In addition, certain of its suppliers and the manufacturers of certain of its products were adversely impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company faced delays or difficulty sourcing products, which negatively affected its business and financial results. Even if the Company were able to find alternate sources for such products, it may cost more and cause delays in its supply chain, which could adversely impact its profitability and financial condition.
 
The Company has taken actions to protect its employees in response to the pandemic, including closing its corporate offices and requiring its office employees to work from home. At its grow facilities, certain practices are in effect to safeguard workers, including a staggered work schedule, and the Company is continuing to monitor direction from local and national governments carefully.
 
As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on its financial results, and the anticipated future impact of the pandemic, the Company has implemented cost control measures and cash management actions, including:
 
● Furloughing a significant portion of its employees; and
 
● Implementing 20% salary reductions across its executive team and other members of upper-level management; and
 
● Executing reductions in operating expenses, planned inventory levels and non-product development capital expenditures; and
 
● Proactively managing working capital, including reducing incoming inventory to align with anticipated sales.

Acquisition of Red Earth
 
On December 15, 2017, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Red Earth, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Red Earth”) established in October 2016, in exchange for 52,732,969 shares of its Common Stock and a promissory note in the amount of $900,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a “Reverse Merger”, whereby Red Earth was considered the accounting acquirer and became its wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the now former members of Red Earth became the beneficial owners of approximately 88% of the Company’s Common Stock, obtained controlling interest of the Company, and retained certain of its key management positions. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition”, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Red Earth prior to the reverse merger in all future filings with the SEC. Red Earth is the holder of a Nevada Marijuana Establishment Certificate for the cultivation of marijuana.
 
The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger included: the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements. In February of 2019, the Company repurchased, from the Company’s largest shareholder, 20,000,000 of the 26,366,484 shares of common stock that this shareholder originally received in connection with the Reverse Merger - for a total purchase price of $20,000.

Our Business History
 
In April 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with Acres Cultivation, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Licensed Operator”) that holds a license for the legal cultivation of marijuana for sale under the laws of the State of Nevada. In January of 2019, the Company entered into a revised agreement, which replaced the April 2018 agreement, with the Licensed Operator in order to be more stringently aligned with Nevada marijuana laws. The material terms of the agreement remain unchanged. The Licensed Operator is contractually obligated to pay over to the Company sixty percent (60%) of the net revenues realized from its management of this facility and twenty-five percent (25%) of the net revenues from equipment rental. The agreement is to remain in force until April 2026. In April 2019, the Licensed Operator was acquired by Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded Canadian cannabis company. The acquisition was subject to all of the contractual obligations between the Company and the Licensed Operator. Please see Note 15 — Subsequent Events for further information.
 
In April 2018, the State of Nevada finalized and approved the transfer of provisional Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate No. 012 (the “Certificate”) from Acres Medical, LLC to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”). HDGLV, LLC (“HDGLV”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Earth, holds a triple-net leasehold interest in a 17,298 square-foot commercial building located on Western Avenue in the City of Las Vegas, which will be home to the Company’s indoor cultivation facility (the “Western Facility”). The initial term of the lease is for a period of ten years with two additional five-year lease options. HDGLV also possesses an option to purchase the building for $2,607,880 which is exercisable between months 25 and 60 of the initial term of the lease. In August of 2018, the Company received final approval from the State of Nevada, Department of Taxation, to commence cultivation activities with respect to the Certificate. Contemporaneously therewith, Red Earth was issued a Business License by the City of Las Vegas to operate a marijuana cultivation facility at the Western Facility. In October of 2018, the Company was requested by the City of Las Vegas Department of Building & Safety to make additional modifications to the building, specifically the removal and remediation of all asbestos materials in the building, which was completed in June of 2019 at a cost of approximately $140,000. In July of 2019, the City of Las Vegas asked the Company to amend its Business License and modify its Special Use Permit (“SUP”) to conform with updated marijuana cultivation requirements within the City. A new SUP was granted on October 9, 2019. The Company expects to receive its new business license in Q4 of 2020, which will then allow the Company to commence legal marijuana cultivation activities within the City of Las Vegas. Due to the failure of Element NV, LLC to make the required payments and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations, the Company is eight months in arrears on rent payable on the Western Facility and has received a Notice of Default from the Lessor. As of the date of this filing, the Company is in active negotiations with the landlord to find an acceptable resolution regarding the payment of past due rent. In the event the Company is not able to make payment arrangements, there is the likelihood that the Company’s lease will be terminated.

Thereafter, for each renewal term, the Company’s minimum purchase obligation for the Goods is $500,000, subject to good faith negotiation at the end of each contract year. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Seller granted to the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, and non-sub licensable fully paid license agreement. The Company and HCMC entered into a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) dated November 15, 2019.

The number of shares exchanged represents less than a 5% ownership interest for each company, and the shares issued are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”). The Company recorded the 85,714 shares of HCMC common stock as an available for sale security and intends to mark the value to market each reporting period based on the current market value of its held shares in HCMC. As of the transaction date, the price as quoted on the OTC Markets for HCMC common stock was $0.0001 per share. Please see Note 15 — Subsequent Events for further information.
 
In August of 2018, the Company executed a letter of intent (“LOI”) for the acquisition of all of the membership units of Farm Road, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“Farm Road”). Farm Road was the owner of five parcels of farmland in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada totaling 260 acres and the concomitant 180 acre-feet of water rights. Pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) executed between the Company and Farm Road in November of 2018, the Company was to acquire Farm Road for $1,000,000 on the following terms: a deposit of $50,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock upon execution of the LOI, was to be held in escrow until closing, $150,000 in cash payable at closing and a promissory note bearing 5% simple annual interest (the “Promissory Note”) in the amount of $750,000.00 payable to FR Holdings, LLC (an unrelated third party) (“FRH”) in 36 equal monthly interest only payments of three thousand one hundred twenty five ($3,125.00) dollars commencing on the March 1, 2019.

The MIPA further provides that FRH shall be entitled to receive a consulting fee of five per cent (5%) of the gross sales from any commercial use of the property up to a maximum of five hundred thousand ($500,000.00) dollars payable to FRH within two years of the January 18, 2019 closing date. The land acquired in Amargosa Valley will be the home of the Company’s Nye County cultivation facility upon closing of the purchase of the cultivation and production certificates in the MIPA3.


In September of 2018, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Red Earth, applied for five Recreational Marijuana Establishment Licenses to operate up to five retail marijuana stores within the state of Nevada. The Company’s goal was to open a store within the City of Las Vegas, as well as additional dispensaries in Washoe County near Lake Tahoe, in North Las Vegas, unincorporated Clark County and Henderson, Nevada. The Company received notice in early December 2018 that none of the submitted applications received sufficiently high enough scores after being graded by the Nevada Department of Taxation (“NVDOT”). In connection with the license applications, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with a third party (the “Party”). Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the Party made payments to the Company totaling $232,500, which was paid during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Party was entitled to receive shares of the Company’s restricted common stock with a fair market value as of the trading day immediately preceding the date the first license application was submitted to NVDOT (September 20, 2018) equal to $232,500. The Company issued 91,177 shares of common stock to the Party in connection with this transaction. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with the Party to relieve the Company and the Party of any further obligations under the MOU in exchange for an additional 373,823 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock. The additional shares were issued to the Party on July 19, 2019.
 
The Company has joined with more than 15 other plaintiffs in an action against the State of Nevada in regard to how the applications were scored and as to why licenses were granted to other applicants in contravention of the guidelines published by the State of Nevada. On August 23, 2019, a Nevada District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining any of the entities that were granted licenses from opening new dispensaries based upon the failure of NVDOT (the administrative body tasked with adopting and enforcing marijuana regulations within the State of Nevada) to enforce a provision of Ballot Question 2 (“BQ2”), that was approved by Nevada voters in 2016 and adopted by the Nevada legislature and codified as NRS 453D, which legalized the sale and distribution of recreational use marijuana. The law requires that “each prospective owner, officer and board member of a marijuana establishment license applicant” undergo a background check. The judge found that many of the successful license applicants failed to comply with this requirement. On August 29, 2019, the judge modified the ruling and is allowing thirteen of the successful license applicants who the State of Nevada have certified as having complied with the requirements of BQ2 to open new dispensaries as granted in December of 2018. The plaintiffs shall now continue to trial on the merits of the pending litigation against the State of Nevada. In March of 2020, counsel for Red Earth withdrew from its representation of Red Earth. Red Earth is actively trying to retain substitute counsel, which as of the date of this filing Red Earth remains unrepresented in this matter. The trial, which was scheduled to commence in April of 2020, has been postponed by the State of Nevada as part of their implementation measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, as of the date of this filing the trial has not commenced.

It is expected that the Company will receive all of the necessary regulatory approvals during the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company is required to issue $1,000,000 of shares of its restricted common stock in fulfillment of its obligations in the MIPA. As of the date of this filing, these shares have not been issued and the parties are renegotiating the pricing of these shares to more accurately reflect the anticipated value at closing. The Company also executed a $750,000 long term note (the “LT Note”) in favor of the current license holders that becomes due and payable upon the earliest of a) six months after the transfer of the Certificates to the Company, or b) six months after the production/cultivation is declared fully operational by the applicable regulatory agencies, or c) March 10, 2020. On February 19, 2020, the Company was put on notice by the Seller that it is in default under the terms of the MIPA, however, the parties are continuing to act in good faith towards a mutually satisfactory resolution. The LT Note carries an 8% annual interest rate and there is no penalty for any prepayment. Additionally, the Sellers shall receive, at closing, warrants to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares of the Company’s common stock; 1,000,000 warrants shall be exercisable for a period of three years from the closing date at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and 500,000 warrants shall be exercisable for a period of two years from the closing date at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (collectively the “Warrants”). The LT Note, Warrants and the restricted common shares issued will be held in escrow until the transaction closes. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the MIPA, the Company was required to enter into a $15,000 per month sub-lease (retroactive to March 1, 2019) for the 10-acre cultivation/production facility located in Pahrump, Nye County, NV and install a mobile production trailer. The Company acquired the production trailer from Solaris Farms, a related party, in April 2020 at a cost of $120,000. It is the intention of the Company, upon receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, to move the cultivation license and production trailer from its current location to the Company’s 260-acre facility. Please see Note 13 —Asset Impairment and Note 15 — Subsequent Events for further information.
 
In April of 2019, the Company consummated its purchase of an approximately 50-acre, commercial trailer and RV park (the “Trailer Park”) in close proximity to its Amargosa Valley cultivation facilities. The Trailer Park can accommodate up to 90 trailers and RV’s. There presently are 17 occupied trailers in the Trailer Park, and the Company is making the necessary upgrades to bring additional units to the facility to provide housing for its farm personnel. The Company purchased the Trailer Park for a total of $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock, resulting in the issuance of 66,667 shares. The Sellers hold a $250,000 note, bearing interest at six and one-half percent resulting in monthly payments in the amount of $2,178 based upon a 15-year amortization schedule (the “TP Note”). The TP Note requires additional principal reduction payments in the amount of $50,000 on or before April 5, 2020 and April 5, 2021, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company has failed to make the required principal reduction payment that was due on April 5, 2020. Additionally, due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, the Company has been unable to make its monthly payments of $2178 pursuant to the terms of the TP Note. The Company is in arrears to the holders of the TP Note in the amount of $58,711. The principal and interest payments will be recalculated based on a 15-year a amortization schedule upon each principal reduction payment.

There are no prepayment penalties should the Company elect to retire the note prior to its maturity date.

The Company intends to continue to grow its business through the acquisition of existing companies and/or through the development of new opportunities and joint ventures that can maximize shareholder value while providing a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure (dispensaries), cultivation, production, management, and consulting services in the regulated cannabis industry.
 
Marijuana Industry Overview
 
The Company currently operates a marijuana business in the State of Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana is permitted in Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. The Company believes it operates its business in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state, or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect its ability to operate its business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with its business plans, could expose the Company to potential criminal liability, and could subject its properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance, or other business services may also affect the Company’s ability to operate its business.
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds”. The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ than for other purposes such as hemp production. Generally, references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp production.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. Indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The female plants produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of April 2021, there are a total of 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision. These 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.
 
As of April 2021, 16 states and the District of Columbia now allow for the recreational use and possession of small amounts of marijuana and marijuana products. Decriminalization of marijuana varies by state. Decriminalization generally means that violators of local marijuana laws may be subject to civil penalty rather than face criminal prosecution. Fifteen states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana but have not legalized possession. In these states decriminalization can mean possession of as little as ten grams of marijuana up to one-hundred grams of marijuana that will not result in any criminal prosecution but may result in civil fines. In three states, Idaho, South Dakota, and Kansas, the cultivation, possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited and violators may be subject to criminal prosecution. In Nevada, where the Company is headquartered and has focused most of its activities, legalized marijuana for recreational use was effective as of July 1, 2017, which made it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, businesses can legally, pursuant to state regulations, cultivate, process, dispense, distribute, and test marijuana products under certain conditions.

The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws. In March of this year, U.S. Congressman Ed Perlmutter (D – Colorado) introduced house bill H.R. 1595, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to allow legally operating cannabis related businesses to utilize traditional banking services without fear of federal agencies taking legal action against the banks or their customers. The SAFE bill has strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and many industry observers anticipate it will be ratified within the next year.
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity.
 
In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to the Company’s business and its revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, is a rider to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition was in place until November 21, 2019.
 
The Company is monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s, and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, the Company understands that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on its business and results of operations.
