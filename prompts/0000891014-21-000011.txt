Performance Materials Segment

The Performance Materials segment is a leading supplier of bentonite and bentonite-related products. Bentonite is a sedimentary deposit containing greater than 50% montmorillonite and is volcanic in origin. It is surface mined and then dried, crushed, sent through grinding mills where it is sized to customer requirements, and transferred to silos for automatic bagging or bulk shipment.  The processed bentonite may be chemically modified.  Bentonite’s unique chemical structure gives it a diverse range of capabilities, enabling it to act as a thickener, sealant, binder, lubricant or absorption agent.  There are two primary types of natural bentonite utilized by the business, sodium and calcium. Sodium-bentonite is characterized by its ability to absorb large amounts of water and form viscous, thixotropic suspensions.  Calcium-bentonite, in contrast, is characterized by its low water absorption and swelling capabilities and its inability to stay suspended in water. Each type of bentonite has its own unique applications.  This segment also supplies chromite and leonardite, which is primarily used in metalcasting, drilling fluid additive, and agricultural applications. The principal products of this segment are marketed under various registered trade names, including VOLCLAY®, PANTHER CREEK®, PREMIUM GEL®, ADDITROL®, PREMIUM CHOICE®, ENERSOL®, RAFINOL® and Hevi-Sand®.

PCC Products – Paper

In the paper industry, the Company's PCC is used:


● | as a filler in the production of coated and uncoated wood-free printing and writing papers, such as office papers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | as a filler in the production of coated and uncoated groundwood (wood-containing) paper such as magazine and catalog papers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | as a coating pigment for both wood-free and groundwood papers and packaging.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Company's Paper PCC product line net sales were $308.4 million, $364.9 million and $378.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Approximately 19% of the Company's sales consist of PCC sold to papermakers from "satellite" PCC plants. A satellite PCC plant is a PCC manufacturing facility located near a paper mill, thereby eliminating costs of transporting PCC from remote production sites to the paper mill. The Company believes the competitive advantages offered by improved economics and superior optical characteristics of paper produced with PCC manufactured by the Company's satellite PCC plants resulted in substantial growth in the number of the Company's satellite PCC plants since the first such plant was built in 1986. For information with respect to the locations of the Company's PCC plants as of December 31, 2020, see Item 2, "Properties," below.

The Company currently manufactures several customized PCC product forms using proprietary processes. Each product form is designed to provide optimum balance of paper properties including brightness, opacity, bulk, strength and improved printability. The Company's research and development and technical service staff focuses on expanding sales from its existing and potential new satellite PCC plants, as well as, developing new technologies for new applications. These technologies include, among others, acid-tolerant ("AT®") PCC, which allows PCC to be introduced to the large wood-containing segment of the printing and writing paper market, OPACARB® PCC, a family of products for paper coating, our FulFill® family of products, a system of high-filler technologies that offers papermakers a variety of efficient, flexible solutions which decrease dependency on natural fibers, and NewYield® and ENVIROFIL®, innovative technologies that convert a paper and pulp mill waste stream into functional pigments for filling paper.

The Company owns, staffs, operates and maintains all of its satellite PCC facilities, and owns or licenses the related technology. Generally, the Company and its paper mill customers enter into long-term evergreen agreements, initially ten years in length, pursuant to which the Company supplies substantially all of the customer's precipitated calcium carbonate filler requirements. The Company is generally permitted to sell to third-parties PCC produced at a satellite plant in excess of the host paper mill's requirement.
  
The Company also sells a range of PCC products to paper manufacturers from production sites not associated with paper mills. These merchant facilities are located at Adams, Massachusetts and Lifford, United Kingdom.

PCC Markets – Paper

Uncoated Wood-Free Printing and Writing Papers – North America. Beginning in the mid-1980's, as a result of a concentrated research and development effort, the Company's satellite PCC plants facilitated the conversion of a substantial percentage of North American uncoated wood-free printing and writing paper producers to lower-cost alkaline papermaking technology. The Company estimates that during 2020, more than 90% of North American uncoated wood-free paper was produced employing alkaline technology. Presently, the Company owns and operates 15 commercial satellite PCC plants located at paper mills that produce uncoated wood-free printing and writing papers in North America.
Uncoated Wood-Free Printing and Writing Papers – Outside North America. The Company estimates the amount of uncoated wood-free printing and writing papers produced outside of North America at facilities that can be served by satellite and merchant PCC plants is more than twice as large (measured in tons of paper produced) as the North American uncoated wood-free paper market currently served by the Company. The Company believes that the superior brightness, opacity and bulking characteristics offered by its PCC products allow it to compete with suppliers of ground limestone and other filler products outside of North America. Presently, the Company owns and operates 38 commercial satellite PCC plants located at paper mills that produce uncoated wood-free printing and writing papers outside of North America.  In addition, there is 1 plant currently under construction that will begin production in 2021.

Uncoated Groundwood Paper. The uncoated groundwood paper market, including newsprint, represents approximately 24% of worldwide paper production. Paper mills producing wood-containing paper still generally employ acid papermaking technology. The conversion to alkaline technology by these mills has been hampered by the tendency of wood-containing papers to darken in an alkaline environment. The Company has developed proprietary application technology for the manufacture of high-quality groundwood paper in an acidic environment using PCC (AT® PCC). Furthermore, as groundwood or wood-containing paper mills use larger quantities of recycled fiber, there is a trend toward the use of neutral papermaking technology in this segment for which the Company presently supplies traditional PCC chemistries. The Company now supplies PCC at 4 groundwood paper mills around the world and licenses its technology to a ground calcium carbonate producer to help accelerate the conversion from acid to alkaline papermaking.

Coated Paper. The Company continues to pursue satellite PCC opportunities in coated paper markets where our products provide unique performance and/or cost reduction benefits to papermakers and printers. Our Opacarb® product line is designed to create value to the papermaker and can be used alone or in combination with other coating pigments. PCC coating products are produced at 7 of the Company's PCC plants worldwide.

Raw Materials

The Company depends in part on having an adequate supply of raw materials for its manufacturing operations, particularly lime and carbon dioxide for the PCC product line, and magnesia and alumina for its Refractory operations. We also depend on having an adequate supply of bentonite and leonardite for our Performance Materials segment and limestone and talc for our Processed Minerals product line. Supplies of bentonite, leonardite, limestone and talc are provided through the Company’s own mining operations and we depend on having adequate access to ore reserves of appropriate quality at such mining operations.

The Company uses lime in the production of PCC and is a significant purchaser of lime worldwide. Generally, the lime utilized in our business is readily available from numerous sources and we purchase lime under long-term supply contracts from unaffiliated suppliers located in close geographic proximity to the Company's PCC plants. We also produce lime at our Adams, Massachusetts facility and our Lifford, UK facility, although most of the lime produced at our Adams facility and all of the lime produced at our Lifford facility is consumed in the production of Specialty PCC at the plant. We currently supply some quantities of lime to third parties that are in close proximity to our Adams plant and could supply small quantities of lime to certain of our PCC satellite facilities that are in close geographic proximity to the Adams plant. Carbon dioxide is readily available in exhaust gas from the host paper mills, or other operations at our merchant facilities.

The principal raw materials used in the Company's monolithic refractory products are refractory-grade magnesia and various forms of alumina silicates. Approximately 49% percent of the Company’s magnesia requirements were purchased from sources in China over the past five years. The price and availability of bulk raw materials from China are subject to fluctuations that could affect the Company's sales to its customers. In addition, the volatility of transportation costs has also affected the delivered cost of raw materials imported from China to North America and Europe. The Company has developed alternate sources of magnesia over the past few years that have reduced our reliance on China-sourced magnesia. The amount sourced from China and other locations can vary from year to year depending upon price and availability from each source. The alumina we utilize in our business is readily available from numerous sources. The Company also purchases calcium metal, calcium silicide, graphite, calcium carbide and various alloys for use in the production of metallurgical wire products and uses lime and aluminum in the production of calcium metal.

 
In addition to bentonite and leonardite provided through our mining operations, our Performance Materials segment’s principal raw materials are coal, soda ash, chromite, and woven and unwoven polyester material, all of which are readily available from numerous sources.

Mineral Reserves and Mining Process

The Company relies on access to bentonite reserves to support its Performance Materials segment. The Company has reserves of sodium and calcium bentonite at various locations in the U.S., including Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana and Alabama, as well as in Australia, China, and Turkey. Through the Company’s affiliations and joint ventures, the Company also has access to bentonite deposits in India, and Mexico. Assuming the continuation of 2020 annualized usage rates, the Company has reserves of commercially usable sodium bentonite for the next 51 years. Under the same assumptions, the Company has reserves of commercially usable calcium bentonite for the next 27 years. The Company owns or controls the properties on which the bentonite reserves are located through long-term leases, royalty agreements (including easement and right of way agreements) and patented and unpatented mining claims. No single or group of mining claims or leases is significant or material to the financial condition or operations of our Company or our segments. The majority of our current bentonite mining in the U.S. occurs on reserves where our rights to such reserves accrue to us through over 80 mining leases and royalty agreements and 2,000 mining claims. A majority of these are with private parties and located in Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. The bentonite deposits underlying these claims and leases generally lie in parcels of land varying between 20 and 40 acres.

In general, our bentonite reserves are immediately adjacent to, or within sixty miles of, one of the related processing plants. All of the properties on which our reserves are located are either physically accessible for the purposes of mining and hauling or the cost of obtaining physical access would not be material. Access to processing facilities from the mining areas is generally by private road, public highways, or railroads. For most of our leased properties and mining claims, there are multiple means of access.

Bentonite is surface mined, generally with large earthmoving bulldozers and scrapers, and then loaded into trucks and off-highway-haul wagons for movement to processing plants. The mining and hauling of our bentonite is done by us and by independent contractors. At the processing plants, bentonite is dried, crushed and sent through grinding mills, where it is sized to customer requirements, then chemically modified, where needed, and transferred to silos for automatic bagging or bulk shipment. Most of the production is shipped as processed rather than stored for inventory.

For our Performance Materials segment, we also mine leonardite, a form of oxidized lignite, in North Dakota, and transport it to nearby processing facilities. Assuming the continuation of 2020 annualized usage rates, the Company has reserves of commercially usable leonardite for more than 30 years.

The Processed Minerals product line of our Specialty Minerals segment is supported by the Company's limestone reserves located in the western and eastern parts of the United States, and talc reserves located in Montana. The Company generally owns and surface mines these reserves and processes its products at nearby processing plants. The Company estimates these reserves, at current usage levels, to be in excess of 36 years at its limestone production facilities and in excess of 15 years at its talc production facility.

The Company has ongoing exploration and development activities for all of its mineral interests with the intent to increase its proven and probable reserves.

See Item 2, “Properties,” for more information with respect to these facilities and mines.

The Company relies on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite within and from the United States, Turkey and China to customers, as well as our own subsidiaries, and we are sensitive to our ability to recover these shipping costs. In the last few years, bulk cargo shipping rates have been very volatile, and, to a lesser extent, the availability of bulk cargo containers has been sporadic.

Competition

The Company is continually engaged in efforts to develop new products and technologies and refine existing products and technologies in order to remain competitive and to position itself as a market leader.

 
For the Performance Materials segment, the Company competes on the basis of product quality, service, technical support, price, product availability and logistics.  There are numerous major producers of competing products and various regional suppliers in the areas the Company serves. The Company is the world leader in bentonite, including number one positions in metalcasting and pet litter.  With respect to the environmental products product line, the Company competes with geosynthetic clay liner manufacturers worldwide, several suppliers of alternative lining technologies, and providers of soil and environmental remediation solutions and products. The building materials product line competes in a highly fragmented market comprised of a wide variety of alternative technologies. A number of integrated bentonite companies compete with our drilling products.

With respect to its PCC products, the Company competes for sales to the paper industry with other minerals, such as GCC and kaolin, based in large part upon technological know-how, patents and processes that allow the Company to deliver PCC that it believes imparts gloss, brightness, opacity and other properties to paper on an economical basis. The Company is the leading manufacturer and supplier of PCC to the paper industry.

The Company competes in sales of its limestone and talc based primarily upon quality, price, and geographic location.

With respect to the Company's refractory products, competitive conditions vary by geographic region. Competition is based upon the performance characteristics of the product (including strength, consistency and ease of application), price, and the availability of technical support.

The Energy Services segment competes with other oil and gas services companies. However, the Company believes that the Company offers several competitive advantages, especially in the area of water treatment services, due to superior and innovative technologies that the Company has developed internally and the combination of services that the Company can provide.

Seasonality

Some of our products in the Performance Materials segment within the environmental and building materials product lines are impacted by weather and soil conditions. Many of the products cannot be applied in wet or winter weather conditions and, as such, sales and profits tend to be greater during the period from April through October. As a result, we consider the business of this segment to be seasonal. Our Processed Minerals product line of our Specialty Minerals segment is subject to similar seasonal patterns.

Much of the business in the Energy Services segment can be impacted by weather conditions. Our business is concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico where our customers’ oil and gas production facilities are subject to natural disasters, such as hurricanes. Given this, our Energy Services sales could be lower in the June to November months.

Research and Development

Many of the Company's product lines are technologically advanced. The Company’s internal research team has dedicated years of experience into analyzing properties of minerals and synthetic materials while developing processes and applications to enhance their performance. Our expertise in inorganic chemistry, crystallography and structural analysis, fine particle technology and other aspects of materials science apply to and support all of our product lines. The Company's business strategy for growth in sales and profitability depends, to a large extent, on the continued success of its research and development activities.

The Company’s Performance Materials segment also offers a strong portfolio of custom blended compounds, formulations and technology, which have been primarily developed internally by the Company’s research and development efforts. The ADDITROL® formulation, a custom blend, meets the need of both ferrous and non-ferrous applications. The Volclay® application is used in green sand molding applications ranging from the production of iron and steel castings to the production of non-ferrous castings. The Hevi-Sand® specialty chromite blend prevents metal penetration and can be used with most foundry binders in molds and cores. In addition, the Company’s RESISTEXTM and CONTINUUM® formulation enables withstanding aggressive leachates. The ORGANOCLAY® technology offers highly effective solutions in effective in removing oils, greases and other high molecular weight, low solubility organic compounds from aqueous streams. The Company will also continue to seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies, developed mainly by our internal research team, to incorporate into our product lines.

In the Specialty Minerals segment, the significant achievements of the Company's research and development efforts include: the satellite PCC plant concept; PCC crystal morphologies for paper filling and coating; FulFill® high filler technology systems; NewYield® Waste Stream Process Technology; ENVIROFIL® Waste Stream Process Technology; Thixocarb® PCC, Vicality® USP PCC, EMforce®, and Optibloc® for the Processed Minerals and Specialty PCC product lines.

 
The FulFill® brand High Filler Technology is a portfolio of high-filler technologies that offers papermakers a variety of efficient, flexible solutions that decreases dependency on natural fiber and reduces costs. The FulFill® E and V series allows papermakers to increase filler loading levels of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), which replaces higher cost pulp, and increases PCC usage. Depending on paper grades, this PCC volume increase may range from 15 to 30 percent.  NewYield® Waste Stream Process Technology cost-effectively converts a problematic pulp mill waste stream into a functional pigment for filling paper, eliminating the cost of environmental disposal and remediation of certain waste streams to papermakers. The product and technology have been validated on a commercial scale in a pulping operation and papermaking system in China, with several current projects underway. ENVIROFIL® Waste Stream Process Technology cost-effectively converts a problematic de-inked sludge waste into a functional pigment for filling paper, eliminating the cost of environmental disposal and remediation.

In the Refractories segment, the Company’s achievements include the development of FASTFIRE® and OPTIFORM® shotcrete refractory products; LACAM® laser-based refractory measurement systems; and the MINSCAN® and HOTCRETE® application systems. The Company will continue to reformulate its refractory materials to be more competitive.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company spent approximately $19.9 million, $20.3 million and $22.7 million, respectively, on research and development. The Company's research and development spending for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately 1.2%, 1.1% and 1.3% of net sales, respectively.

The Company maintains its primary research facilities in Bethlehem and Easton, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; and Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It also has research and development facilities in China, England, Germany, Ireland, Japan and Turkey. Approximately 190 employees worldwide are engaged in research and development. In addition, the Company has access to some of the world's most advanced papermaking and paper coating pilot facilities.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company owns or has the right to use approximately 338 patents and approximately 1,706 trademarks related to its business.  Our patents expire between 2021 and 2037.  Our trademarks continue indefinitely.  The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent, application or trademark is material to the conduct of the Company's business as a whole.
Insurance

The Company maintains liability and property insurance and insurance for business interruption in the event of damage to its production facilities and certain other insurance covering risks associated with its business. The Company believes such insurance is adequate for the operation of its business. There is no assurance that in the future the Company will be able to maintain the coverage currently in place or that the premiums will not increase substantially.

Our "safety first" culture has been built through dedication, continuous improvement and active engagement.  We continue to enhance our safety culture and our top priority is for all employees and contractors to return home in the same condition they arrived to work. While we believe zero-injuries across all our operations is attainable, we have set goals of 1.00 for Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR, which is the number of recordable injuries per 100 employees) and 0.10 for Lost Workday Injury Rate (LWIR, which is the number of lost workday injuries per 100 employees), and we continue to make strides to drive incidents below these levels.  In 2020, our TRIR was 0.60 and our LWIR was 0.22.  This safety-first mindset helps us attract and retain top talent from around the world and drives continuous improvement in our manufacturing operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world.  Protecting the health and safety of our employees is one of our core values.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we put in place a robust series of protocols to protect our employees while ensuring the safe and efficient operations of our facilities, including temporarily closing certain of our facilities; enhanced screening at entry to our facilities; restricting access at all facilities to business-critical visits; increasing cleaning and disinfecting protocols; use of personal protection equipment and additional hygiene supplies; adhering to social distancing guidelines; instituting remote work; restricting travel, and quarantining certain personnel.  Employees are continuing to work from home where possible.

Operational Excellence Culture

Our Operational Excellence (OE) journey, rooted in the active engagement of our employees, began more than a decade ago when we developed a comprehensive and highly structured business system of lean principles closely integrated with safe and reliable work practices. We’ve significantly advanced OE across all aspects of our company, fostering a culture of continuous improvement where each employee recognizes the importance of applying these people-focused principles and tools to solve challenges, constantly refine our processes, identify and remove risk and waste, and deliver value to our customers. Every day, MTI employees show their engagement and apply their skills in ways that deliver measurable outcomes and create both business and social value.
