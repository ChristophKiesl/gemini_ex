General 
 
The registrant was incorporated on December 28, 2017 as a British Virgin Islands Company with limited liability. The registrant was incorporated as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Following the Business Combination (as described and defined below) in October 2019, the registrant changed its name from Greenland Acquisition Corporation to Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation (“Greenland”).
 
Greenland serves as the parent Company for the primary operating Company, Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong on April 23, 2009 (“Zhongchai Holding”). Through Zhongchai Holding and other subsidiaries, Greenland develops and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as well as develops electric industrial vehicles, which are expected to be produced in the near future.
 
Greenland, through its subsidiaries, is:
 

● | a leading developer and manufacturer of transmission products for material handling machineries in China; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | since December 2020, a developer of electric industrial vehicles, with our first model of electric industrial vehicle expected to be available in the third or fourth quarter of 2021.

 
Greenland’s transmission products are key components for forklift trucks, used in manufacturing and logistic applications such as factories, workshops, warehouses, fulfilment centers, shipyards, and seaports. Forklifts play an important role in logistics for many enterprises across different industries in the PRC and around the globe. Generally, industries with the largest demand for forklifts are transportation, warehousing logistics, electrical machinery, and automobile.
 
Greenland has experienced an increase in demand for forklifts in the manufacturing industry in the PRC, as its revenue increased from approximately $52.40 million in the fiscal year of 2019 to $66.86 million in the fiscal year of 2020. The increased revenue of approximately $14.46 million was primarily due to the fact that demand for our products has returned to normal and continued to grow. Based on the revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland believes that it is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks in China.
 
Greenland’s transmission products are used in 1-ton to 15-tons forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. Greenland sells these transmission products directly to forklift-truck manufacturers. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland sold an aggregate of more than 108,913 and 83,567 sets of transmission products, respectively, to more than 100 forklift manufacturers in the PRC.
 
In December 2020, Greenland launched a new division to focus on the electric industrial vehicle market, a market that Greenland intends to develop to diversify its product offerings. With this new division, Greenland plans to develop and deploy the next generation of industrial vehicles. Greenland plans to establish a new facility on the east coast of the U.S. and start producing electric industrial vehicles between the third and fourth quarter of 2021.

Significant Activities since Inception
 
Initial Public Offering
 
On July 27, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,400,000 units, including a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 400,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. Warrants must be exercised in multiples of two warrants, and each two warrants are exercisable for one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generated $44,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and offering expenses) in gross proceeds.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 282,000 units, issued to Greenland Asset Management Corporation (the “Sponsor”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, which generated $2,820,000 in gross proceeds.
 
Business Combination 
 
On October 24, 2019, we consummated our business combination with Zhongchai Holding (the “Business Combination”) after a special meeting, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), dated as of July 12, 2019, among (i) Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding, (iii) the Sponsor in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the “Purchaser Representative”), and (iv) Cenntro Holding Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the “Zhongchai Equity Holder” or the “Seller”).
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland acquired from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, to the Seller (the “Exchange Shares”). As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by the Share Exchange Agreement, where Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
 
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization (the “Recapitalization Transaction”) in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. For accounting and financial reporting purposes, Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer based on the following facts and circumstances:
 

● | Zhongchai Holding’s operations comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The officers of the newly combined company consist of Zhongchai Holding’s executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel; and
● | The former shareholders of Zhongchai Holding own a majority voting interests in the combined entity. 

 
As a result of Zhongchai Holding being the accounting acquirer, the financial reports filed with the SEC by the Company subsequent to the Business Combination are prepared “as if” Zhongchai Holding is the predecessor and legal successor to the Company. The historical operations of Zhongchai Holding are deemed to be those of the Company. Thus, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Zhongchai Holding prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Zhongchai Holding and Greenland following the Business Combination in October 2019; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Zhongchai Holding at their historical cost, and (iv) Greenland’s equity structure for all periods presented. Zhongchai Holding received 7,500,000 shares of Greenland in exchange for all the share capital, which is reflected retroactively to December 31, 2017 and will be utilized for calculating earnings per share in all prior periods. No step-up basis of intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in the Business Combination transaction, which is consistent with the treatment of the transaction as a reverse recapitalization of Zhongchai Holding. 
 
Incorporation of Greenland Technologies Corp.
 
On January 14, 2020, Greenland Technologies Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware (“Greenland Tech”). Greenland Tech is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant.

Transmission Systems. For 14 years, Greenland, along with its subsidiaries, specialized in designing, developing, and manufacturing a wide range of transmission systems for material handling machineries, in particular forklift trucks. The range of the transmission systems covers from one ton to fifteen tons machineries. Most transmission systems contain auto transmission features. This feature allows for easy machine operations. In addition, Greenland provides transmission system for internal combustion powered machineries as well as for electrical powered machineries. Greenland has experienced an increasing demand for electric powered transmission systems. These transmission systems are key components for material handling machinery assembly. To meet this increasing demand, Greenland is able to providing these transmission systems to major forklift truck original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) as well as certain global branded manufacturers.
Integrated Powertrain. Greenland has newly designed and developed unique powertrains, which integrates electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles into a combined integral module, in order to meet a growing demand for advanced electric forklift trucks. This integrated powertrain will enable the OEMs to significantly shorten design cycle, improve machinery efficiency, and simplify manufacturing process. There is a new trend that OEMs would rather use an integrated powertrain than separate electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles, particularly in electric forklift trucks. Currently, Greenland makes two tons to three and a half-tons integrated powertrains for few electric forklift truck OEMs. Greenland is in the process to add more integrated powertrain products for electric forklift truck OEMs with different sizes.
 
Electric Industrial Vehicles (to be launched in third or fourth quarter 2021)
 

There is an increasing demand for electric industrial vehicles where sustainable energies are used in order to reduce air pollutions and lower carbon monoxide emissions. For Greenland, it plans to enter into the electric industrial vehicles market by utilizing its existing technologies, know-hows, supply chains, and market access. Greenland’s teams have been developing 1.8 tons electric loader vehicle (GEL1800) and plans to setup an assembly facility on the east coast of the United States for final assembly. GEL1800 will be our first electric industry vehicle product and will be available in the third or fourth quarter of 2021. Other models, such as models with loading capacity of one and a half tons or five tons are currently under development. Greenland will co-operate with global parts suppliers to utilize their matured supply chain, which will enable it to shorten its development cycle and make quicker market entrance.

Suppliers
 
Greenland purchases its raw materials from various suppliers for use in the manufacture of its products.
 
The key raw materials used to manufacture its products are processed metal-based parts and components, including iron castings and gears, which are purchased from our domestic suppliers in the PRC. Most of our suppliers are located within close proximity to our manufacturing facilities, which reduces our transportation and inventory costs.
 
The prices for iron and steel and other raw materials have historically fluctuated significantly in the PRC, which in turn has affected the Company’s business and operation results. Greenland closely monitors changes in raw material prices and seeks to adjust its inventory of raw materials during inflation periods. In addition, Greenland seeks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in raw material prices by adopting bidding processes in its raw material procurement process Greenland also seeks to price its products to reflect the expected fluctuations in raw material prices to the extent possible. However, there can be no assurance that Greenland could precisely estimate any increase in raw material price or pass on such increase to its customer.
 
Production
 
Greenland’s products are comprised of a number of major parts and components, including gearbox housing, gears, bearings, oil pumps, gear shafts, hydraulics, and electrical components. The gearbox housing and gears parts are processed in-house at its manufacturing facility in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, PRC. Components of such products, in general, are sourced, from third parties, assembled, and integrated to form finished products. The finished products then undergo further adjustments, fine tunings, testing, and quality inspections. At the end of the inspection process and prior to shipment to our warehouses for storage and distribution, the finished products are coated and painted.
 
For the manufacturing of its electric industrial vehicles, Greenland plans to establish a new facility on the east coast of the U.S. and start producing electric industrial vehicles between the third and fourth quarter of 2021.
 
Inventory and Warehousing
 
Greenland undertakes inventory control in order to reduce the risks of under and over-stocking. On average, Greenland typically maintains a 30 days stock piles for production needs. It generally increases its inventories toward the end of the year in order to meet any production demand, in anticipation of any demands increase, from the second quarter of the following year. Furthermore, Greenland maintains higher inventories at year-end because Chinese New Year typically falls in January or February, which affects production and transportation of raw materials. Greenland has installed an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, which provides real-time information about purchases, production schedules, and supplies of the raw materials. The ERP system has substantially improved Greenland’s inventory controls, providing the Company with quick access to various data and easy formulation of operating models, and allowing the Company to keep its inventory at an appropriable level to facilitate the manufacturing process. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company’s production significantly decreased during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020. However, since March 2020, the Company’s production has returned to normal, and the Company experienced a substantial increase in production demand in November and December 2020.
Research and Development
 
Greenland’s research and development team selects research or development projects or both and draws up preliminary project proposals based on various factors, such as industry and market trends, customer feedback, and input from other departments (i.e. finance and manufacturing departments).
 
Greenland’s management, including the heads and lead managers of various internal departments, such as sales and marketing and finance departments, as well as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, reviews the preliminary project proposals and its research and development team formulates a final plan for each approved project after considering suggestions and comments by its management. The final plans will include detailed schedules and budgets for the projects. Greenland’s finance department monitors budget overruns. Any increase in the original budget must be reviewed and approved by management before the relevant project can continue.
 
Greenland has also focused on research and development with respect to a new electric industrial vehicle.

Strategic Growth Opportunity in the Electric Industrial Vehicle Industry
 
Greenland will expand its market presence by entering the electric industrial vehicle industry. With our strategic supply chain partners, we have leveraged our robust research and development capabilities, as well as our industry and market experience to develop a new product line of electric industrial vehicles. By July 2021, Greenland expects to complete its first production-ready model of electric industrial vehicle product. A compact electric loader vehicle with a payload capacity of approximately 1,800 kilograms (or 3,968 lbs.). This new product line of electric industrial vehicles will offer a better return on investment when compared to existing Internal Combustion (“IC”) industrial vehicles by leveraging Greenland’s established global supply chain and expertise in the electrification of material handling vehicles. Following the first electric loader product, Greenland intends to expand its product line to other industrial vehicles and sizes.
 
We believe that electric industrial vehicles, which include electric loaders, excavators and forklift trucks, have the following advantages over traditional IC vehicles:
 

● | Zero carbon emission. Fully electric industrial vehicles are completely emission free leading to less pollution from local usage. In addition, electrical power generation produces less carbon emissions when compared to fossil fuel. This results in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable power source. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lower energy usage and maintenance costs. Electric industrial vehicles offer a significant saving in energy consumption when compared to diesel equipment. Conventional internal combustion power systems require costly routine maintenance that increases with age. Without the need to maintain these internal combustion engines, electric industrial vehicles provide significantly less maintenance costs and less operational downtime resulting in a greater return on investment. 
● | Lower level of noise and vibration. Electric vehicles are proven to produce less sound and vibration when compared to internal combustion vehicles due to the lack of complicated transmission components and coolant pumps. The low noise levels of electric industrial vehicles offer new opportunities to businesses such as working at night in urban areas or during the day close to noise-sensitive locations like parks and hospitals. 
● | Demand for Better Workplace Safety and New Applications. Conventional excavators and loaders that use internal combustion engines create significant fumes, emissions, noises and vibrations which can harm the health of staff and surrounding residents. These problems can be addressed by the adoption of electric powered equipment which produce zero emissions, low levels of noise and minor vibrations. This creates a safer work environment and new business opportunities for indoor applications. 

 
We believe that the electric industrial vehicle market presents a substantial opportunity for Greenland’s future business growth:
 
Fast Growing Market. The global construction equipment market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.9% from 2020 to 2025, reaching US$205 billion1. The North American market is projected to exhibit one of the fastest growth rates during the forecast period. Consequently, we believe this growth will increase with the introduction of the United State infrastructure overhaul program. Should the program be implemented, then it will be a powerful driver of growth in the engineering and construction industry that will proliferate the demand for industrial vehicles and equipment.
 
Call for Carbon Emission Reduction. Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions continue to grow with proposals such as the current US administration seeking a target of net zero emission by 2050. These strategies will result in government and public support for the adoption of emission zero technologies and equipment across industries thus boosting the demand for eco-friendly electric powered industrial vehicles. As such, we expect that the demand for electric industrial vehicles will increase rapidly.
Highly Fragmented and Emerging Market. The electric industrial vehicle market is highly fragmented with few, if any, dominant local market participants. Although a few conventional industrial vehicles and construction equipment makers are in the process of electric products development a majority are years away from product deployment. This is to avoid cannibalization with the mature fossil fuel-powered equipment product lines which results in the lack of incentive to launch the full-electric industrial vehicles at the near term. As a result, with the early mover advantage together with Greenland’s strong research and development capability, we believe that Greenland is well positioned to secure a meaningful role in the electric industrial vehicle market.

Law and Regulation Relating to Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
On March 16, 2007 and December 6, 2007 respectively, the National People’s Congress of China and the State Council of the PRC enacted the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC and the Implementation Regulations of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (collectively the “PRC EIT Law”), both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. The PRC EIT Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all residence enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations. 
 
However, the PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain “high-technology enterprises strongly supported by the state” which hold independent ownership of core intellectual property and simultaneously meet a list of other criteria, financial or non-financial, as stipulated in the Implementation Rules, to enjoy a 15% enterprise income tax rate subject to certain new qualification criteria. The SAT, the PRC Ministry of Science and Technology and the MOF jointly issued the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High and New Technology Enterprise delineating the specific criteria and procedures for “high and new technology enterprises” certification.

Under the PRC EIT Law, enterprises are classified as either “resident enterprises” or “non-resident enterprises.” Pursuant to PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules, besides enterprises established within the PRC, enterprises established outside PRC whose “de facto management bodies” are located in PRC are considered “resident enterprises” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. According to the implementation rules of the PRC EIT Law, “de facto management body” refers to a managing body that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the manufacture and business, personnel, accounting and assets of an enterprise.
 
Withholding Tax
 
The PRC EIT Law removes the prior tax exemption and imposes a 10% withholding tax on dividends paid by foreign-invested enterprises to foreign investors. However, for foreign investors whose home countries or regions have signed bilateral tax agreements with PRC, the withholding tax rate may be reduced to as low as 5% depending on the terms of the applicable tax treaty. In accordance with the Arrangement between Mainland PRC and Hong Kong for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed on August 21, 2006, the 5% withholding tax rate applies to dividends paid by a PRC Company to a Hong Kong tax resident, provided that the recipient is a Company that holds directly at least 25% of the interest of the PRC Company, otherwise, the applicable withholding tax rate should be 10%. Further, pursuant to the Notice on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements issued by the SAT on February 20, 2009, the preferential tax rate under the relevant tax treaties shall only apply to a tax resident from the other side that directly holds at least 25% of the interest of a PRC Company for a period of consecutive 12 months prior to receiving the dividends.
Value Added Tax
 
The Provisional Regulations of the PRC Concerning Value Added Tax (the “VAT Regulations”), was promulgated on December 13, 1993 and amended by the State Council and became effect on November 19, 2017. Under the VAT Regulations and its implementation regulations, value added tax, or the VAT, is imposed on the sales of goods and provision of processing, repair and replacement services within the PRC and the importation of goods into PRC. The VAT standard rate had been 17% of the gross sale price until April 30, 2018, after which date the rate was reduced to 16%. VAT rate was further reduced to 13% starting from April 1, 2019.
 
On April 4, 2018, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued the Circular on Adjustment of VAT Rates, which became effective as of May 1, 2018. According to the Circular on the Adjustment of VAT Rates, relevant VAT rates have been reduced from May 1, 2018, such that VAT rates of 17% and 11% applicable to the taxpayers who have VAT taxable sales activities or imported goods are adjusted to 13% and 9%, respectively.
 
Law and Regulation Relating to Intellectual Property Rights
 
Copyright Law
 
According to the Copyright Law of the PRC, which was amended on February 26, 2010 and became effective on April 1, 2010, Chinese citizens, legal entities or other organizations shall enjoy the copyright in their works, whether published or not, which include works of literature, art, natural sciences, social sciences, engineering and technology, etc. Copyright owners shall enjoy various kinds of rights, including the right of publication, right of authorship and right of reproduction.
Patent Law
 
Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC which was amended on December 27, 2008 and became effective on October 1, 2009, the patent administration departments of the State Council are responsible for the administration of patents across the nation. The patent administration departments of provincial, autonomous region or municipal governments are responsible for administering patents within their respective jurisdictions. The PRC patent system adopts a “first come, first file” principle, which means where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet three criteria: novelty, inventiveness and practicability. Invention patents are valid for 20 years, while utility model patents and design patents are valid for 10 years, commencing from the date of application. The patentee shall pay annual fees commencing from the year when the parent right is granted. If the patentee does not pay annual fees according to the requirements, the patent will be terminated prior to its expiry. Other person must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use constitutes an infringement of the patent rights. The infringer must, in accordance with the applicable regulations, undertake to cease the infringement, take remedial action and/or pay damages.

Trademark Law
 
Pursuant to the Trademark Law of the PRC which was amended on August 30, 2013 and became effective on May 1, 2014, the right to exclusive use of a registered trademark shall be limited to trademarks which have been approved for registration and to commodities for which the use of trademark has been approved. The period of validity of a registered trademark shall be 10 years, counted from the day the registration is approved. If a trademark registrant wishes to use a trademark after the expiration of the duration of the trademark registration, according to the requirements, a registration renewal application should be filed within 12 months prior to the expiration. Each registration renewal is valid for 10 years. Using a trademark that is identical with a registered trademark on the same commodities without the licensing of the registrant of the registered trademark; or using a trademark that is similar to a registered trademark on the same commodities, or using a trademark that is identical with or similar to the registered trademark on similar commodities without the licensing of the registrant of the registered trademark, which is likely to cause confusion; selling commodities that infringe upon the exclusive right to use a registered trademark; forging, manufacturing a registered trademark which was registered by others without authorization, or selling a registered trademark forged or manufactured without authorization; changing a registered trademark and putting the commodities with the changed trademark into the market without the consent of the registrant of the registered trademark; providing, intentionally, convenience for activities infringing upon others’ exclusive right to use a registered trademark, and facilitating others to commit infringement on the exclusive right to use a registered trademark, constitutes an infringement of the exclusive right to use a registered trademark. The infringer must undertake to cease the infringement, take remedial action and pay damages. The infringer also may be subject to fines or even criminal punishment.
Domain Names
 
The domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures for Internet Domain Names promulgated by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, on August 24, 2017, the effective date of which was November 1, 2017. MIIT is the major regulatory body responsible for the administration of the PRC Internet domain names, under supervision of which PRC Internet Network Information Center, or CNNIC, is responsible for the daily administration of CN domain names and Chinese domain names. On September 25, 2002, CNNIC promulgated the Implementation Rules of Registration of Domain Name, or the CNNIC Rules, which was renewed on June 5, 2009 and May 29, 2012, respectively. Pursuant to the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names and the CNNIC Rules, the registration of domain names adopts the “first to file” principle and the registrant shall complete the registration via the domain name registration service institutions. In the event of a domain name dispute, the disputed parties may lodge a complaint to the designated domain name dispute resolution institution to trigger the domain name dispute resolution procedure in accordance with the CNNIC Measures on Resolution of the Top-Level Domains Disputes, file a suit to the People’s Court or initiate an arbitration procedure.

Under the SAFE Regulations, the RMB is generally freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, repatriation of investment and investment in securities outside the PRC, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange is obtained.
 
U.S. Laws and Regulations
 
Vehicle Safety and Testing
 
We expect to be required to comply with federal laws administered by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, owner’s manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and 5-star safety ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.
Battery Safety and Testing
 
Our battery packs of electric industrial vehicles will be subject to various U.S. regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We expect to use lithium battery packs in our electric industrial vehicles. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future.
