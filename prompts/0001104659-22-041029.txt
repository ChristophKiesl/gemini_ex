Item 1. Business.
In this Annual Report, references to the “company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Iconic Sports Acquisition Corp.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on April 15, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. While we may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our sponsor group and management team to identify, acquire and accelerate a business in the global sports industry or an adjacent sector including data and analytics, media and technology. In doing so, we intend to focus our search on iconic businesses, including sports franchises, which will complement our differentiated expertise, benefit from our strategic and hands-on operational leadership and where we believe there are opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns and to build a platform for future investments.
With decades of combined global experience across the sports, media and financial investment landscapes, and with significant transactional expertise, access to capital and a track record of value creation, both in the United States and in Europe, we believe our combined sponsor group and management team will make us a unique partner to potential target businesses and will enhance our ability to effect an attractive and successful business combination.
The registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-260096 and 333-260421) for our initial public offering were declared effective on October 21, 2021. On October 26, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the company, with each public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to the company's registration statements. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the company of $345,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we completed the sale of 17,025,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, Iconic Sports Management LLC, generating proceeds of $17,025,000.
A total of $353,625,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Our Units, Class A ordinary shares and public warrants are each traded on the NYSE under the symbols “ICNC.U,” “ICNC” and “ICNC WS,” respectively. Our Units commenced public trading on October 22, 2021, and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants commenced separate public trading on December 13, 2021.
Market Opportunity
We believe that sports and adjacent technology and services markets are among the most attractive segments in the broader media entertainment ecosystem, supported by macro tailwinds, large addressable markets and the ability for organic growth and consolidation. We believe that our sponsor group and management team is uniquely positioned to identify and execute an attractive transaction that will leverage the macro trends outlined below and create significant shareholder value as a result of our investment and operating expertise.

Unparalleled value and growth of global sports ecosystem. The total addressable market of the professional sports and adjacent technology and services sectors is estimated at approximately $172 billion and growing at approximately 8% per year, underpinned by continued high global demand for live viewership and other forms of sports media consumption. The value of this unique, exciting, unscripted and live form of entertainment is best exemplified by the continued inflation in sports media rights. A recent example is the new 11-year National Football League’s rights deal, which is estimated to be worth over $110 billion and which constitutes an increase of approximately 75% comparing to the prior deal, based on annual contract value. The deal has attracted significant investment from Amazon.com, Inc., marking further validation of the value of premium must-have sports content for both traditional broadcasters and new entrants, such as over-the-top delivery platforms. Jointly with the continued proliferation of online and mobile connectivity and the growth of social media, this has continued to drive value for major sports franchises and businesses serving the wider sports industry across the globe.
Market dislocation from COVID-19. The impact of the global pandemic on sports franchises and sports- related adjacencies has been profound. As a result, sports franchises and vendors are facing a significant strain on cash flows, leaving many ownership groups without the appetite, nor liquidity to continue franchise funding for an undetermined period. Organizations with inefficient operating models are experiencing significant stress during these times, leading many groups to revaluate their funding strategies. While the length and severity of the impact on live events and other core activities is still uncertain, the market has historically proven resilient to cyclicality—especially for businesses with strong fundamentals and long-term intellectual property value—and is poised to benefit from strong demand in a post-COVID environment.
Decisive shift towards professional ownership and management. Global sports franchises, leagues and businesses active within the wider sports ecosystem are attracting unprecedented interest from institutional and more sophisticated investors. As these businesses reach scale at a global level and need to continue to grow shareholder value in a competitive market, there will be an increased need for professional ownership and management. Access to capital and financial expertise will be fundamental for businesses that require significant funding in coming years for projects, such as infrastructure and stadium developments, squad investments and others.
Continued technological and data-driven value creation. Technology has significantly transformed consumer behavioural and engagement patterns; and digital adoption and innovation is changing the way that businesses around the globe are conducting their operations. The need for innovative and dynamic operating models is increasingly evident, accelerated by the global pandemic. In order to drive shareholder value, the sports industry can benefit significantly from increased adoption of technology informing data- driven team management and capital allocation decisions, player and performance analytics and Enterprise Resource Planning/Customer Relationship Management improvements. Our management team and sponsor group have significant experience and track-record in pursuing value creation opportunities via adopting innovative and data-driven techniques, which will be leveraged to identify and pursue assets with unique potential.
Global sports platform. Significant synergies can be achieved by building a global sports platform, where best-in-class management practices, capital allocation and innovation can be shared and optimised across various assets. As more sports franchises and sports and media related businesses understand the necessity of building global brands in order to compete for revenue and brand recognition across wider consumer audiences, experienced management teams with operational and financial expertise will be required to create value and enhance visibility and profitability.
Sourcing
We intend to leverage both the sponsor group’s and management team’s unique and extensive global networks to access direct and proprietary business combination opportunities. Our competitive advantage is driven by the deep industry experience and extensive deal sourcing capabilities of our sponsor group and management team. We believe our process of screening and selecting potential target companies for our initial business combination will be highly differentiated and that through our combined networks and expertise we can generate a wide range of business combination opportunities with potential target companies.

We plan to utilize the collective and distinctive capabilities of our sponsor group and management team and, in particular, leverage the:

● | deep and broad network of relationships in the sports and entertainment industry to create a significant pipeline of opportunities including opportunities with multiple professional sports franchises and adjacent businesses (both in the United States and Europe);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extensive experience of sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | use of advanced analytics to evaluate opportunities and provide businesses with competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | track record of driving value in existing businesses, including operating leading sport franchises; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | significant M&A experience, including in consummating transactions across a wide range of sectors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to our sponsor group’s and management team’s sourcing and evaluation capabilities, our board of directors will be comprised of senior executives with complementary business profiles and experience in a variety of relevant industries. We believe our directors will add depth to our expertise, broaden our network of relationships, and provide exceptional governance to our company. We expect our broad network to provide our management team with a robust flow of business combination opportunities.
We also anticipate that we will have opportunities to leverage our relationships with several investment banks, private equity groups and law firms, which will present us with certain advantages in identifying prospective target companies in the areas that we determine are appropriate and attractive for our initial business combination.
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is to source, identify, acquire and, upon completion of our initial business combination, accelerate a business to create long-term value for our shareholders. While we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we believe the experience of our sponsor group and management team will be highly complementary to a business in sports or in adjacent data and analytics, media and technology sectors, particularly a business that can benefit from our strategic, operational and financial expertise.
Our global network of investors and connections provides us with wide access to source attractive opportunities and our team will consider a broad set of opportunities but will apply a disciplined investment framework based on core acquisition criteria.
We believe our sponsor group and management team will be able to provide a level of support and assistance on key operational and strategic matters that is highly differentiated relative to other potentially competing SPACs. The recent achievements of members of our sponsor group and management team with the Milwaukee Bucks (National Basketball Association (“NBA”) Championship winners 2021) and the Italian national football team (European Championship winners 2020) only serves to further underline our ability to add significant value. We are therefore focused on opportunities where we will have a unique advantage in driving value creation once a business combination is completed. We have an extensive track record as investors and operators, which in our view will differentiate us as potential partners in an initial business combination and will be a valuable factor in distinguishing ourselves to potential target businesses.
Initial Business Combination
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so 

9



if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-business combination company will own or acquire 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a business combination in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our pre-combination shareholders could own less than a majority of the shares of the post business-combination company. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Our Acquisition Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have developed the following general, non-exclusive investment criteria and guidelines that we believe are important and plan to use when screening for and evaluating target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any or all of these criteria and guidelines. We will seek to acquire a business that:

● | operates in sports or an adjacent industry and is well-positioned to benefit from the broad network and strategic expertise of our sponsor group and management team;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is a leading business with strong business fundamentals, intrinsic brand value and a seasoned executive leadership;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is operating at scale and is prepared to make the transition to the public markets, but can benefit from guidance and advice in developing a clear message describing the business model and investment opportunity to public investors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




● | has the potential to develop fundamentally sound financial performance, with visibility into revenue and cash flow growth and relatively predictable future financial performance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operates in a large addressable market and has a sustainable competitive advantage;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | would benefit from an acquisition strategy and more efficient capital allocation and could leverage our access to capital, operational expertise and financial insights; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | would serve as a platform for both organic and acquisitive growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target that does not meet the above criteria, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review, which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with members of the target’s management and other employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also benefit from our sponsor group’s and management team’s network of relationships with senior executives, board members and members of executive management teams to provide specialized insights into their areas of expertise and leverage their operational and capital planning experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or any subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Tifosy or Tifosy Capital & Advisory, our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with Tifosy or Tifosy Capital & Advisory, our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with Tifosy Capital & Advisory, our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion, from either an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting, valuation or appraisal firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of the management team, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following the closing of our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officer and director was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then he or she may be required to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. If those other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. We will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. While Tifosy Capital & Advisory will not have any duty to present business combination opportunities to us, Tifosy may become aware of a potential transaction that may be an attractive opportunity for us, which it may or may not decide to share with us. Tifosy is a boutique advisory firm focused exclusively on the professional sports sector. As such, Tifosy provides a diversified range of financial advisory services in a broad spectrum of 

11



activities including merger and acquisition advisory services. Additionally, we may, but are not required to, engage Tifosy for services as a financial advisor in connection with identifying and investigating potential targets for our initial business combination. Conflicts may arise from Tifosy’s part sponsorship of our company, its provision of services both to us (including as a financial advisor) and to third-party clients. In performing services for other clients and also when acting for its own account, Tifosy may take commercial steps that may have an adverse effect on us.
In addition, our officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. In particular, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-

12



affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter.
Our executive offices are located at 190 Elgin Avenue, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-9008, Cayman Islands. We maintain a corporate website at www.iconicsportsacq.com. The information that may be contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference in, or otherwise a part of, this Annual Report.
