 Overview
  
  AIFarm, Ltd., formerly Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. (the “Company” “we” or “us”) is a development stage company. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on January 20, 2015. To date we have not generated any revenues. We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs and builds custom biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial agricultural concerns as well as small local producers; delivering greater yields per meter than traditional single level greenhouse operations resulting from our multi-tier/multi-level growing system which permits us to grow a greater number of plants. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
  
  On February 27, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. (“EETA”), a Hong Kong corporation formed on December 27, 2012. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the sole shareholder of EETA in exchange for 1,000,000 ordinary shares of EETA. The sole shareholder of EETA, Yuen May Cheung, is also our Chief Executive Officer, President and sole Director.  EETA is also the owner of 92.4% of the common stock of 7582919 Canada, Inc., a corporation originally formed pursuant to the laws of British Columbia, Canada on June 21, 2010, as Renergy Foods Canada, Inc.

  We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs and builds custom biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial agricultural concerns as well as small local producers; delivering greater yields per meter than traditional single level greenhouse operations as a result of our multi-tie/multi-level system which permits us to grow a greater number of plants. By avoiding a traditional, low-profit commoditized monoculture environment, we can increase profitability by selling a higher yielding and diversified range of high-profit niche produce.
  
  Our proprietary biodomes are environmentally friendly and can be located anywhere, including in the most climatically inhospitable areas. The Company’s technologies provide the ability to grow high margin produce for twelve (12) months of the year, with faster growing times and cost-effective energy management. As a result, clients will experience faster capital payback, enhanced profitability and compelling, consistent revenue growth.
  
  Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. was initially established as a technological solution providing enterprise, through intense research and development, a proprietary growing system that builds and develops custom biodomes with diverse sizes for global agricultural use, especially for the smallholder farmers. This innovative product promises greater agriproduct returns over the conventional single level greenhouse operations. This operation permits multistage/multi-phase planting systems which encourages growing and monitoring diverse plants. Furthermore, this connotes our anticipation and preparation for the Connected Crop Solution in 2019 where Digital Agricultural Ecosystem is feasible.
  
  As of 2019, we have diversified into the creation of two major innovative advancements in the market through the combination of digital technologies such big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), visualization capabilities and more informed knowledge concerning the industry to AIFarm Digital Agriculture Service and Aifarm Connected Crop Solution.
