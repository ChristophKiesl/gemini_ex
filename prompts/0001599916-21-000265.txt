Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 30, 2019, under the name Business Solutions Plus, Inc.
 
On August 30, 2019, Paul Moody was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director.
 
On February 9, 2021, the Company filed, with the Secretary of State of Nevada (“NSOS”), Restated Articles of Incorporation.
 
On March 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., (the “Company” or “Successor”) announced on Form 8-K plans to participate in a holding company reorganization (“the Reorganization” or “Merger”) with InterActive Leisure Systems, Inc. (“IALS” or “Predecessor”), the Company and Business Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), collectively (the “Constituent Corporations”) pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250.
 
Immediately prior to the Reorganization, the Company was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Interactive Leisure Systems, Inc. and Business Solutions Merger Sub, Inc. was a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
As disclosed in our 8-K filed on March 26, 2021, the above-mentioned Reorganization was legally effective as of March 31, 2021.
 
Each share of Predecessor’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Successor common stock. The control shareholder, (at the time) of the Predecessor, Flint Consulting Services, LLC, (“Flint”) a Wyoming limited liability company became the same control shareholder of the Successor. Jeffrey DeNunzio, as sole member of Flint is (was) deemed to be the indirect and beneficial holder of 405,516,868 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company representing approximately 93.70% voting control of the Company. Paul Moody, (our now former sole officer/director), was the same officer/director of the Predecessor. There are/were no other shareholders or any officer/director holding at least 5% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company.
 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and under the respective articles of incorporation of Predecessor and Successor, the Successor Capital Stock had the same designations, rights, and powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof, as the Predecessor Capital Stock which was automatically converted pursuant to the reorganization.
 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor, as the holding company, contain provisions identical to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200.
 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Predecessor stated that any act or transaction by or involving the Predecessor, other than the election or removal of directors of the Predecessor, that requires for its adoption under the NRS or the Articles of Incorporation of Predecessor the approval of the stockholders of the Predecessor, shall require in addition the approval of the stockholders of Successor (or any successor thereto by merger), by the same vote as is required by the articles of Incorporation and/or the bylaws of the Predecessor.
 Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Successor and Merger Sub were identical to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Predecessor immediately prior to the merger, other than as permitted by NRS 92A.200;
 The Boards of Directors of Predecessor, Successor, and Merger Sub approved the Reorganization, shareholder approval not being required pursuant to NRS 92A.180;
 The Reorganization constituted a tax-free organization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code;
 Successor common stock traded in the OTC Markets under the Predecessor ticker symbol “IALS” under which the common stock of Predecessor previously listed and traded until the new ticker symbol “BSPI” was announced April 14, 2021, on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s daily list with a market effective date of April 15, 2021. The CUSIP Number 45841W107 for IALS’s common stock was suspended upon market effectiveness. The Company received a new CUSIP Number 12330M107.
 After completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company cancelled all of its stock held in Predecessor resulting in the Company as a stand-alone and separate entity with no subsidiaries, no assets and negligible liabilities. The Company abandoned the business plan of its Predecessor and resumed its former business plan of a blank check company after completion of the Merger.
 On May 4, 2021, Business Solutions Plus, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (the “Company”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among Flint Consulting Services, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company (“FLINT”), and White Knight Co., Ltd., a Japan Company (“WKC”), pursuant to which, on May 7, 2021, (“Closing Date”) , FLINT sold 405,516,868 shares of the Company’s Restricted Common Stock and 1,000,000 Shares of Series A Preferred Stock, representing approximately 93.70% voting control of the Company. WKC paid consideration of three hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($325,000) (the “Purchase Price”). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement resulted in a change in control of the Company, with WKC becoming the Company’s largest controlling stockholder.
 
The sole shareholder of White Knight Co., Ltd., a Japanese Company, is Koichi Ishizuka.

Japanese Food-Service Market
 
The Japanese Food-Service Market is Segmented by Type (Full-service Restaurants, Quick Service Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, 100% Home Delivery Restaurants, Street Stalls and Kiosks) and Structure (Independent Consumer Food Service and Chained Consumer Food Service). We believe Japanese consumers, in general, tend to be highly demanding, putting great emphasis on quality and branding and are willing to spend more resources on value-added products.
 
The Japanese food service market was valued at USD 142.84 billion in 2020, and it is projected to witness a CAGR of 0.84% during the forecast period, 2021 - 2026. The coronavirus pandemic has made short-term projections hard to predict, with sales in March 2020 down almost 40% for some food companies. Japanese food service operators, which rely on lunch and dinner demand from business workers, are also suffering as more companies have employees working from home at the government’s request.
 
According to a report released by TableCheck Inc., the percentage of reservations (dining reservations) being canceled increased about 3.6 times before the pandemic for groups of 10 or more. A French restaurant and bar named Scene near Hachioji Station on the Keio Line, earlier in June 2020, launched take-out and delivery services which we believe many others will begin offering if not already, due in part to the changing attitudes of dining out as a result of the ongoing pandemic. We believe take-out and delivery services, along with menu options that are quick to prepare, increasing in consumer demand.
 
The variety of restaurants and menu items available in the Japanese food service industry continues to expand in the country, as Japanese consumers are interested in trying a new and vast variety of cuisines, which are available at their convenience in Japan. Food from Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas are becoming increasingly popular, partly due to a large number of Japanese traveling abroad every year.
 
The Japanese food service market is highly competitive, with a major market share held by prominent companies, such as McDonald’s Corporation, Yum! Brands Inc., Zensho Holdings Co. Ltd, Skylark Group, MOS Food Services Inc., and Yoshinoya Holdings Co. Ltd. Zensho Holdings Co. Ltd, with the largest market share of 2.76% in 2020, emerging as the market leader, and Skylark Group holding the second-largest share with 1.66%.
 
Currently, in the Japanese market, hamburgers and related fast-food options have been prevalent, with high-end gourmet hamburgers being in the most expensive category consisting usually of single restaurant locations, followed by lesser expensive hamburger options via chain restaurants such as Shake Shack and MOS Premiums. The size of the current market for hamburgers in Japan is approximately $6.6 Billion (2020), and has been steadily increasing ever since 2015. It is also projected to grow by approximately 5% over the next few years. Hamburgers are considered to be one of the few food categories that were not affected by COVID-19 in Japan and were able to take advantage of home deliveries and to-go orders during the pandemic.

Business Information
 
Master Franchise Agreement and Related Information
 
On September 14, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity interest of WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., a Japan Company. Following the acquisition, we ceased to be a shell company and adopted the same business plan as that of our now wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. Within this section, all references to “the Company”, “WB Burgers”, and or WBBA refer to WB Burgers Asia, Inc. and WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. as one collective party.
 
WBBA holds the rights to the “Master Franchise Agreement” with Jakes’ Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback Burger Restaurants within the country of Japan.
 
The Master Franchise Agreement provides WBBA the right to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the country of Japan, and also license affiliated and unaffiliated third parties (“Franchisees”) to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Country of Japan. The Master Franchise Agreement, amongst other things, also provides WBBA the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement with Jake’s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan.
 
WBBA seeks to make “Wayback Burgers” a nationally recognized brand, if not a household name, within the country of Japan through the promotion and opening of various Wayback Burgers Restaurants.
 
Background

The first Wayback Burgers, previously known as Jake’s Wayback Burgers, began with a single location in Newark, Delaware approximately thirty years ago in 1991, offering a combination of burgers, hot dogs, fries, milkshakes, and other similar menu options. Since then, it has reached a global scale with a presence in the US, Europe, Africa, and Asia with hundreds of corporate owned restaurants and over five hundred franchise locations worldwide offering much of the same comfort items many have grown accustomed to, with the addition of a few menu items specifically geared toward the pallets of those in various demographics.
 
The products we seek to offer in our anticipated location(s), and those we seek to franchise to within Japan, will also offer many of the same product offerings many are accustomed to elsewhere such as hamburgers, hot dogs chicken sandwiches, hand-dipped milkshakes, various side dishes, fresh salad, kid’s meals, refreshing drinks and alcoholic beverages. We intend to source our ingredients in any of our future location(s) from highly regarded local Japanese suppliers in order to satisfy the food quality standards as set by Wayback Burgers Inc., within the United States.
 
Our First Location
 
Currently, we are negotiating a lease space with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese realty group for the lease of a space we hope to make our first Wayback Burgers location in the country of Japan. Negotiations are ongoing, but we are presently nearing a finalized agreement pending a few minor alterations. The property is located in the popular shopping plaza of Omotesando located in the Tokyo prefecture. We believe the high volume of foot traffic and shopping will yield a large group of patrons seeking to try our product offerings. Currently, we have inspected the property in detail and are in discussions with the local fire department as to what is needed to bring the space up to code in respect to a restaurant that can house upwards of several hundred patrons at a time. We are also in discussions with Arai Co., Ltd. regarding what measures need to be taken to create handicap accessible areas and to improve upon existing structures that had been put in place by the previous tenant.
 
We are also in the midst of conversations with the adjacent apartment complex as it pertains to volume restrictions and patrons dining outside during nighttime hours. Currently, the adjacent apartment complex has tentatively agreed to allow guests of our proposed restaurant to dine outside through 9:30pm however, we’d prefer it be 10:00pm. These and many other factors are in flux, and the fact they are in flux is the reason we have not yet signed the lease with Arai Co., Ltd. although, we do anticipate hashing out such details and moving forward within the next month. If, we are not able to secure this particular space, we will seek out a comparable space, also in what we believe to be a high traffic area in Tokyo.
 
Below is a photograph of the space we seek to lease from Arai Co., Ltd. (second floor). Logos and branding of neighboring business have been blurred out in the below image.
 


Once we are able to secure and sign a lease for our initial restaurant space, we seek to open within a few months thereafter once we are able to hire qualified staff. Currently, we have already vetted out and pre-emptively hired various employees such as line cooks and other workers for when we do open our first location. We believe we will need to hire approximately 11 employees to efficiently operate our first restaurant location. Our personnel plan calls for a minimum of one store manager, licensed to cook, with the ability to manage between eight to ten employees. We will require that our store manager has the requisite training and skillset to take spearhead breakfast and dinner menu creation, as well as procurement and cost vs profit calculations. The eight to ten employees will be a combination of full-time and part-time employees who will operate our flagship store between the hours of 7:00 am to 11:00 pm. Specialized training for our staff will include, but not strictly be limited to, food preparation, cooking, POS (point of sale) operations, sanitation, etc.

Marketing Strategy
 
In order to grow an initial customer base, from which we intend to launch future expansion efforts, our marketing strategy begins with the physical location of our flagship restaurant. Our plan, at present, is to select a suitable location in an area of Omotesando with high foot-traffic that can serve to attract not only customers, but also future franchisee prospects throughout Japan. For future franchisee locations, we intend to identify areas where competitors are not already located, such as road-side in the outskirts of major cities, and open our restaurants in these areas.
 
However, we do not intend to rely solely on physical location in order to attract customers, we also are in the development stages of a robust marketing stratagem comprised, in part, of SNS (social networking service) marketing through collaboration with influencers and celebrities, magazine advertisements, and expansive television and media appearances. The specifics of these marketing initiatives are in the planning stages and have not yet been determined in sufficient detail to disclose in their entirety.
 
Wayback Burgers in Japan intends to position itself as a newly entered and authentic American hamburger brand, comparable to our competitor Shack Shake, while contrasting ourselves through offering higher quality foods at comparable price points. We plan to achieve this by focusing on the ingredients, such as the option of vegetables in our hamburgers, the increased diameter of our meat patties, and the overall volume of our menu items. Additionally, we intend to offer original Japanese breakfast and dinner menu options, as well as forming a special collaboration focused on all-plant based alternative foods with Next Meats, Co., Ltd., a Japanese alternative meat company.
 
Expansion Plans
 

We have forecasted our expansion plans, as depicted in the image above, over the next few years. However, when our operations commence, we may find that our plans may be materially altered, expanded, or curtailed as dictated by market forces at the time. As such, our expansion plans should be read as a framework for our future goals, but not a guarantee that we will carry out any or all such operations in the indicated timeline.
 
At present our expansion plans are as follows:
 
- We are currently in the midst of negotiating a lease agreement for our fist location, currently planned for Omotesando which will be within shopping range of Aoyama and Hajajuku. During this period of time we are also seeking to hire the necessary staff (approximately 11 employees) to manage and operate our flagship location. 
 
- We anticipate that hiring will continue into November, during which time training of staff will remain ongoing and the flagship location will continue to prepare for its forthcoming grand opening. 
 
 - In mid-December we aim to open our first flagship restaurant location in Omotesando, Tokyo. 
 
 - Over the course of 2022, we are aiming to open five Wayback Burgers restaurants throughout Japan, with one of these restaurants directly managed by us while the remaining four would ideally be franchise locations. This number may increase or decrease depending on the results of our operations.- 
 
- Additionally, during 2022, we intend to execute another master franchise agreement in Asia for the right to open Wayback Burgers restaurants in another Asian country or territory. We have not yet identified which country or territory we will seek to acquire these rights for first. As noted previously, we have the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement with Jake’s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan.

- By the year 2023, we intend for there to be ten Wayback Burgers Franchise locations open throughout Japan. We also intend, during 2023, to execute two additional Master Franchise Agreements in Asia to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurant locations in additional Asian countries or territories.
 Partnerships
 
The company believes partnerships are a vital means to expansion and that partnerships with other food institutions or distributors may allow the Company to provide menu items that might appeal to a larger demographic within the Japanese market.
 
- 7 -


Our current officer and Director, Koichi Ishizuka has existing ties and relationships with Next Meats Co., Ltd. a Japanese alternative meat company, that produces and sells lab grown and meat alternatives to consumers. Additionally, we may explore the possibility of entering into an agreement with Dr. Foods, Inc., a company in the “alternative meat” industry which has common management with the Company. It is the Company’s goal that it will be able to integrate such alternative meat options into its menu, and potentially create customized menu options as provided by Next Meats Co., Ltd. Menu alterations are subject to approval by Jake’s Franchising, LLC. It is the belief of the management that such offerings can gain a larger market share in the country of Japan allowing for greater growth potential. Of course, this is speculative and such plans may not materialize. It is also possible that if such plans do materialize, they may not result in the expected level of growth the Company forecasts as a result of the partnership or partnerships it enters into.
 

It should be noted that Koichi ishizuka has an equity interest in Next Meats Co., Ltd. He also currently serves as Chief Financial Officer of Next Meats Holdings, Inc., a Nevada Company, that has entered into an agreement to acquire Next Meats Co., Ltd. pending various conditions be met.
 
Government Regulations
 
The below does not extensively detail every single law and regulation to which the Company may be subject to, but rather provides an overview of the kind of food safety standards to which our restaurant(s) will be held.
 
The main law that governs food quality and integrity in Japan is the Food Sanitation Act ("FSA") and the law that comprehensively governs food labelling regulation is the Food Labelling Act.
 
The FSA regulates food quality and integrity by:
 
- Establishing standards and specifications for food, additives, apparatus, and food containers and packaging;
 - Providing for inspection to see whether the established standards are met;
 - Providing for hygiene management in the manufacture and sale of food; and
 - Requiring food businesses to be licensed.
 
Under the FSA, additives and foods containing additives must not be sold, or be produced, imported, processed, used, stored, or displayed for marketing purposes unless the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") has declared them as having no risk to human health after seeking the views of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council ("PAFSC"). In addition, it is not permissible to add any processing aids, vitamins, minerals, novel foods or nutritive substances to food unless they have been expressly declared by the MHLW as having no risk to human health.
 
The MHLW may establish specifications for methods of producing, processing, using, cooking, or preserving food or additives to be served to the public for marketing purposes ("Specifications"), or may establish standards for food ingredients or additives to be served to the public for marketing purposes ("Standards") pursuant to the FSA. Accordingly, where substances are allowed to be added to food, they may only be used within the limits expressly set by the Specifications and Standards.
