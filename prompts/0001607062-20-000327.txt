Item 1. Business.
Corporate History 
 Generex Biotechnology Corporation (the “Company,” “Generex,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is based in Miramar, Florida, with offices in Dallas, Texas, Toronto, Canada and Wellesley, Massachusetts. The Company was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 4, 1997, for the purpose of acquiring Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Canadian (Province of Ontario) corporation formed in November 1995 to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and development and other activities. The Company’s acquisition of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. was completed in October 1997 in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. exchanged their shares for shares of Generex common stock.
 
In January 1998, Generex participated in a “reverse acquisition” with Green Mt. P.S., Inc, (“Green Mt.”), an inactive Idaho corporation formed in 1983. As a result of this transaction, the shareholders of Generex (the former shareholders of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) acquired a majority (approximately 90%) of the outstanding capital stock of Green Mt., and Generex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green Mt.; Green Mt. changed its corporate name to Generex Biotechnology Corporation ("Generex Idaho"), and Generex changed its corporate name to GBC - Delaware, Inc. Because the reverse acquisition resulted in GBC - Delaware, Inc. shareholders (formally Generex shareholders) becoming the majority holders of Generex Idaho, GBC Delaware, Inc. was treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes. Thus, our, GBC - Delaware, Inc. (formally Generex), historical financial statements, which essentially represented the historical financial statements of Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., were deemed to be the historical financial statements of Generex Idaho.
 
In April 1999, we completed a reorganization in which GBC - Delaware, Inc. merged with Generex Idaho. In this transaction, all outstanding shares of Generex Idaho were converted into shares of GBC - Delaware, Inc.; Generex Idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity, and we, GBC - Delaware, Inc., changed our corporate name back to "Generex Biotechnology Corporation." This reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting.
 
Following our reorganization in 1999, Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was incorporated in Ontario, Canada, remained as our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of our Canadian operations are performed by Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc. is the 100% owner of 1097346 Ontario Inc., which was also incorporated in Ontario, Canada. In August 2003, we acquired NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly named Antigen Express, Inc. (“NGIO”). NGIO is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant, infectious, autoimmune and allergic diseases. NGIO also does business under the name NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology. On February 25, 2019 Generex issued a dividend of NGIO common stock to Generex shareholders in the amount of 1 share of NGIO for every 4 shares of Generex common stock. On February 24, 2020 Generex issued a dividend of NGIO common stock to Generex shareholders in the amount of 2 shares of NGIO common stock for every 5 shares of Generex common stock. Generex still maintains majority control of NGIO.
 
We formed Generex (Bermuda), Inc., which is organized in Bermuda, in January 2001 in connection with a joint venture with Elan International Services, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan Corporation, plc, (“Elan”) to pursue the application of certain of our and Elan's drug delivery technologies, including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products. In December 2004, we and Elan agreed to terminate the joint venture. Under the termination agreement, we retained all of our intellectual property rights and obtained full ownership of Generex (Bermuda), Inc.; Generex (Bermuda), Inc. does not currently conduct any business activities. We have additional subsidiaries incorporated in the U.S. and Canada which are dormant and do not carry on any business activities.
 
On January 18, 2017, we acquired a majority of the equity interests in Hema Diagnostic Systems, LLC (“HDS”). In December 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in HDS. The company, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Generex, has been renamed NuGenerex Diagnostics, LLC (NGDx), and is managed by President Harold Haines, PhD.
 
On October 3, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary, NuGenerex Distribution Solutions, LLC (“NDS”), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Veneto Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Veneto Holdings, L.L.C. (“Veneto”), pursuant to which NDS purchased certain assets of Veneto and its subsidiaries.
 
Effective October 3, 2018, NDS assigned the Veneto Asset Purchase Agreement to NuGenerex Distribution Solutions 2, LLC.  The sole member of NuGenerex Distribution Solutions 2, LLC is NuGenerex Management Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Generex Biotechnology Corporation.
 
On October 3, 2018, we acquired certain assets from Veneto primarily consisting of the operating assets of (a) system dispensing pharmacies, (b) a central adjudicating pharmacy, (c) a wholesale pharmaceutical purchasing company, and (d) an in-network laboratory.

On November 1, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of Veneto assets (the “Second Closing Assets”), consisting primarily of Veneto’s management services organization business and other assets. The aggregate price for the First Closing Assets and the Second Closing Assets was $30,000,000. We issued a promissory note in the principal amount of $35,000,000 (the “New Note”) consisting of the $30,000,000 purchase price and a $5,000,000 original issue discount, as the sole consideration payable on the Second Closing Date. On January 15, 2019, the parties entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement restructuring payment of the New Note.
 
On March 28, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment, a “Restructuring Agreement” with Veneto and the equity owners of Veneto to restructure the payment of the New Note that provided, in lieu of any cash payments, the Company delivered on May 23, 2019 11,760,000 shares of our common stock; plus an aggregate 5,500,000 shares of the common stock of our subsidiary, NGIO. The Veneto assets acquired by Generex included management services operations, systems, facilities, and other services. The 8,400,000 Generex Shares were delivered on May 23, 2019 provided by the Friends of Generex Trust, but due to the current and ongoing litigation with the Veneto Members, the NGIO Shares have not been delivered, but such shares were also provided by the Friends of the Generex Trust. The shares provided by the Friends of Generex Trust were already issued and outstanding and did not result in any expense of the Company. Since these shares were transferred by an existing shareholder, the value of the shares provided by the Friends of the Generex Trust was reflected in the financial statements as an addition to contributed (paid-in) capital. The provided by the Friends of Generex Trust were already issued and outstanding and did not result in any expense of the Company. Since these shares were transferred by a shareholder to settle an obligation of the Company, the value of the shares provided by the Friends of the Generex Trust to settle the debt was reflected in the financial statements as an additional to contributed (paid-in) capital (the “Trust Shares”).
 
On January 7, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Regentys Corporation for an aggregate of $15,000,000, among which $400,000 was paid in cash and the remainder was paid by the issuance of a promissory note with a fair value of $14,342,414 for a total net purchase price of $14,742,414. The total fair value of the assets acquired totaled $907,883 and goodwill of $13,834,581. Installments payable under the note were tied to specific business development objectives and dates. As of July 31, 2020, an additional $1,168,265 of principal was paid against the note, for a total of $1,568,265 in total payments. Regentys is developing a non-surgical treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
 
On January 7, 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Olaregen Therapeutix Inc. for an aggregate of $12,000,000, among which $400,000 was paid in cash and the remainder was paid by the issuance of a promissory note with a fair value of $11,472,334 for a total net purchase price of $11,872,663. The total fair value of the assets acquired totaled $2,461,439 and goodwill of $9,411,224. $1,766,800 principal was paid against the note as of July 31, 2020 in addition to the $400,000 initial payment. Olaregen is launching an FDA-510(k) cleared wound care product.
 
On May 10, 2019, we acquired from a third party the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in Olaregen in exchange for 4 million shares of the Company’s common stock, plus the issuance of a $2 million promissory note increasing our interest in Olaregen to approximately 62% of Olaregen’s outstanding voting shares, and an additional 900,000 shares. On August 16, 2019 further increased our interest in Olaregen to approximately 76% and on February 14, 2020 acquired the remaining interests in Olaregen and Generex owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Olaregen.
 
On August 1, 2019, as amended on October 10, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary NDS, closed on Asset Purchase Agreements (the “APAs”) for the purchase of substantially all the operating assets of MediSource Partners, LLC (“MediSource”) and Pantheon Medical – Foot & Ankle, LLC (“Pantheon”). Pantheon Medical is a manufacturer of orthopedic foot & ankle surgery kits that offer physician friendly “all-in-one,” integrated surgical kits that include plates, screws, and tools required for orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists conducting foot and ankle surgeries. Generex will issue 400,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the Pantheon assets, and 560,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the MediSource assets, plus additional amounts paid as an earn-out based upon Pantheon and Medisource exceeding specified EBIDTA earnings. At closing, the Company also entered into an 18-month consulting agreement with NDS (the “Travis Bird Consulting Agreement”). As compensation, Travis Bird was to receive $250,000 of Generex common stock, as well as monthly payments equaling $97,222. The monthly payments were to be paid from any available cash from the operations of Pantheon and MediSource. Any remaining balance of such monthly payments was to consist of common stock. The agreement specified the shares are to be freely tradeable. In addition, Travis Bird will agree to fully assign and exchange any ownership rights in any new technology he develops with the Company, in exchange for a payment of $500,000 in value of common stock for each completed item submitted to the FDA. Travis Bird terminated the Consulting Agreement on July 20, 2020 and Travis Bird is no longer entitled to further commissions from future net sales. For the year ended July 31, 2020, Travis earned $1,404,915 under this agreement and has been paid $773,366, leaving a balance of $631,549.


On August 16, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to purchase an additional 900,000 shares of common stock in Olaregen from other shareholders of Olaregen in exchange for 1,905,912 shares of Generex common stock and 476,478 shares of NGIO common stock which increased our interest in Olaregen to approximately 77% of the Olaregen’s outstanding voting shares. In September 2019, the Company converted all of the Series A Preferred Stock of Olaregen into common stock of Olaregen.
 
On November 22, 2019, effective as of November 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement for the purchase of 51% of the outstanding capital stock of GH Care, Inc. DBA ALTuCELL, Inc.(“ALTuCELL”). Under the SPA, in exchange for the ALTuCELL Stock, Generex will issue to ALTuCELL 1,600,000 shares of Generex common stock with a down round provision and price floor of $1.25 per share. The Company will also pay $2.5 million in cash of which $112,000 has already been paid. In addition to stock and cash at closing, Generex has agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $3,500,000 to ALTuCell upon ALTuCell’s attainment of certain milestones.
 
On January 27, 2020, Generex and ALTuCELL executed an Amendment Agreement to the SPA (the “Amendment”). Under the Amendment, closing will occur within 30 days of the full execution of the Amendment, subject to the conditions to closing under the SPA. The parties agreed that Generex will pay the $2.5 million closing payment from certain specifically identified sources. If ALTuCELL chooses to cancel the transaction as a result of delays due to forces beyond the control of Generex, including government regulatory delays or extended reviews by regulators that delay approvals of corporate actions, or by natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond the control of Generex, ALTuCELL, agrees to return all payments made by Generex. As of July 31, 2020, Generex has advanced $212,000 to ALTuCELL, recorded as a component of other current assets. As of the date of this filing, the acquisition did not close, however, both companies are negotiating the terms of the extension.

Business Overview 
 
Our management team has embarked upon a complete strategic reorganization and transformation of the entire corporate structure, leveraging our legacy assets which have applied over $400 million dollars in developmental activities over the years, providing the Company with net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards from both United States and Canadian sources. As of July 31, 2020, the Company has significant NOL carryforwards that are described in detail in the Notes to our Financial Statements included in this prospectus. We have also formulated an acquisition strategy and identified targets to build a specialized healthcare platform with both scalability and the ability to leverage across the organization in an effort to achieve higher profit margins.
 
Since the management team has taken over in January 2017, Generex has been reorganized as a strategic, diversified life science holding company that is actively involved in building a modern organizational platform for the financing, development, commercialization, and distribution of promising devices, biologics, therapeutic, and diagnostic products to improve human health and return value to its investors. As the foundation for the reorganization, we are acquiring operating companies that provide multiple and significant revenue streams through delivery of patient-focused healthcare products and services, including specialty pharmacy, orthopedic implants, surgical supplies, biologics, medical devices, and regenerative medicines. These foundational acquisitions service unique market channels that provide end-to-end healthcare solutions in partnerships with patients, physicians, health systems, and payors. The synergistic business models of the combined organization offer cross channel sales opportunities for rapid growth, with significant revenues and profits projected going forward.
 
Details of the Generex business strategy are provided following the discussion of the Generex historical business and our legacy assets.
 
Historical Business
Historically, we have been a research and development company focused on the commercialization of Oral-lyn buccal insulin spray for diabetes. Additionally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary NGIO, we have a deep intellectual property portfolio of immunotherapy assets relating to the “Ii-Key” technology that activates the immune response for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. We completed a Phase IIb clinical trial of AE37 immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine with the Ii-Key technology in over 300 women with breast cancer on November 15, 2019.
 
In 2017, we acquired HDS (now NuGenerex Diagnostics) and their diagnostic product portfolio of rapid point-of-care EXPRESS test kits and cassettes for infectious disease testing.

Recent Developments
 
Acquisition of Control Stake of ALTuCELL
 
On November 22, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with ALTuCELL, Inc (“ALTuCELL”), a clinical-stage development company with a broad intellectual property portfolio focused on cell encapsulation technology for the treatment of diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory conditions to purchase 51% of ALTuCELL’s equity in exchange for $2,500,000 in cash, $4,000,000 in the Company’s common stock price at $2.50/share, and an opportunity to earn an additional $3.5 million in milestone payments based on achieving clinical and business development milestones.
 
On January 27, 2020, we and ALTuCell executed an Amendment Agreement to the stock purchase agreement (the “Amendment”). Under the Amendment, the closing should occur within 30 days of the full execution of the Amendment, subject to the conditions to closing under the stock purchase agreement. The parties agreed that Generex will pay the $2.5 million closing payment from certain specifically identified sources.
 
If the closing is not completed within 30 days of execution of the Amendment, the stock purchase agreement would lapse unless the parties agree in writing to continue the transaction. Under the Amendment, Generex agreed to fund the ongoing operations of ALTuCELL during the extension period with a payment of $100,000, which was paid, within 2 business days of signing the amendment. If ALTuCELL chooses to cancel the transaction as a result of delays due to forces beyond the control of Generex, including government regulatory delays or extended reviews by regulators that delay approvals of corporate actions, or by natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond the control of Generex, ALTuCELL agrees to return all payments made by Generex. As of the date of this filing, the acquisition did not close, however, both companies are negotiating the terms of the extension.
 
COVID-19 Collaboration Agreement
 
On February 28, 2020, Generex entered into a Collaboration Agreement (the “COVID-19 Collaboration Agreement”) with Beijing Zhonghua Investment Fund Management Co., LTD and Sinotek-Advocates International Industry Development (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (an affiliate of China Technology Exchange) (the “CTE Parties”), to develop a COVID-19 vaccine using the Ii-Key Peptide vaccine technology of Generex’s majority owned subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, Inc. (“NGIO”). Under the COVID-19 Collaboration Agreement, we will make the Ii-Key Peptide vaccine technology available to the CTE Parties. The CTE Parties will provide facilities and personnel for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine under Generex and NGIO technical guidance. The development will include synthesis, analysis and human trials through Phase III, if warranted, in China. The CTE Parties will have exclusive rights to use and commercialize the COVID-19 technology and products in China.
 
The CTE Parties have agreed to set-aside $1,000,000 for expenses during development and human clinical trials. If development and testing are successful, the parties will enter into further collaboration and technology transfer agreements.
 
The CTE Parties have not consummated the agreement by failing to provide the $1,000,000 payment.
 
Other Research and Development Agreements 
 
On March 3, 2020, Generex entered into a Master Services Agreement and Statement of Work Agreement with EpiVax, Inc. (“EpiVax”). The agreement provides for EpiVax to use its proprietary epitope prediction software in the identification, development, and transfer of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 based upon NGIO’s Ii-Key vaccine technology. Generex and NGIO will own the intellectual property generated by EpiVax’s work.


As compensation, Generex will pay the following to EpiVax:
 

• | Fee for Work Plan Completion: $150,000 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Technology Access Fee: $150,000 
• | Yearly renewal Fee: $25,000 
• | A royalty of 20% of payments received for the commercial sale of any product formulation which incorporates NuGenerex Ii-Key technology and EpiVax IP.

The Agreement, among other things, consists of the China Partners providing 100% funding for the clinical development, manufacturing and commercial registration of the Vaccine for China and paying Generex fees that shall be negotiated and agreed upon in subsequent agreements.
Private Placement of Common Stock
 
On August 4, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Anson Investments Master Fund LP (“Anson Master Fund”), Anson East Master Fund LP (“Anson East Master Fund”) and L1 Capital Global Opportunities Master Fund LP (“L1 Capital Master Fund” and together with Anson Master Fund and Anson East Master Fund, the “Buyers”), pursuant to which we sold and issued to the Buyers an aggregate of 5,102,040 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an aggregate price of $2,000,000 (the “Private Placement”).
 Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to the Buyers (i) Series A Warrants to purchase 5,102,040 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate (the “Series A Warrants”) with an initial exercise price equal to $0.392 per share (the “Series A/B Exercise Price”), (ii) Series B Warrants to initially purchase 15,306,122 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate (the “Series B Warrants”) with an initial exercise price equal to the Series A/B Exercise Price; (iii) Series C Warrants to initially purchase 10,204,080 shares of Common Stock (the “Series C Warrants”) at an initial exercise price equal to $0.539 per share; and (iv) Series D Warrants to initially purchase zero shares of common stock (which increases on predetermined reset dates if the Company’s stock price falls below the closing date price or a reset price on a previous reset date) with an exercise price of $0.001 per share (the “Series D Warrants” and together with the Series A Warrants, the Series B Warrants and the Series C Warrants, the “Warrants”) at an exercise price equal to $0.001 per share, in each case, subject to adjustment and beneficial ownership limitations set forth therein.

Discover- Private Financing
 
On December 9, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement with Discover Growth Fund LLC (“Discover”), pursuant to which we issued and sold to Discover an original issue discount convertible note (the “Discover Note”) in the principal amount of $2,200,000, for a purchase price of $2,000,000. We also issued to Discover 100,000 shares of common stock. The Discover Note bears interest at the initial rate of 12% per year (subject to adjustment under certain conditions), payable upon repayment, maturity or conversion. The Company may prepay the Discover Note upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice, by paying 120% of the then-outstanding face value of the Discover Note. The Discover Note is convertible into common stock at the option of the holder commencing on the earlier of six months after the issuance date or the effective date of the registration statement which register the resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Discover Note.
 
The number of shares issuable upon such conversion will be equal to the face value being converted divided by the conversion price. The conversion price was initially equal to 95% of the average of the 5 lowest individual daily weighted daily volume weighted average prices of the common stock during the period beginning on the issuance date and ending on the maturity date), less $0.05 per share, subject to adjustment. As a result of the trigger event that occurred under the Discover Note, as discussed below, this 95% amount has been reduced to 80%.
 
Because the conversion price, as defined under the Discover Note, cannot be determined prior to the maturity date, such conversion price may not be determinable at the time of a conversion by the holder. The number of conversion shares initially issued upon such a conversion will thus be based on an estimated conversion price. In the event the market price of our common stock subsequently falls, resulting in a lower actual conversion price than such estimated conversion price, the holder will be entitled (upon notice to the Company) to additional shares of common stock for any conversion effected under such lower estimated conversion price. This may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.
 
The Discover Note is also subject to conversion at the option of the Company, subject to certain conditions.
 
We may not issue shares upon conversion of the Discover Note to the extent such issuance would result in the holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock.
 
The Company will have the option, within one trading day of the effectiveness of the registration statement for the resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Discover Note being declared effective, to sell to Discover an additional original issue discount note in the principal amount of $275,000, for a purchase price of $250,000.

The Company was required to file a registration statement for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Discover Note within 30 days of execution of the Discover Note and the Company failed to comply with this requirement in a timely fashion. This failure constitutes a “trigger event” under the Discover Note, as a result of which the conversion price has been reduced, as discussed above, and the interest rate has increased to 22%.
 
On February 18, 2020, Discover brought a legal action against us in connection with the Discover Note. See “Legal Proceedings.”
 
Treatment of Legacy Assets
 Generex and its subsidiary companies have extensive patent portfolios, with intellectual property for composition of matter, formulation, design, and use in a number of therapeutic areas, across multiple indications. As described, we plan to build our legacy assets with the ultimate goal to spin-out such assets at the appropriate time, which have been incorporated into NuGenerex subsidiary companies in an effort to unlock the potential unrealized value of the intellectual property and commercial opportunities for these development companies in major markets for immuno-oncology, diabetes, and infectious disease testing:

• | NuGenerex Therapeutics: Oral-lyn (Buccal Insulin) and RapidMist Buccal delivery technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology: Phase II AE37 + Keytruda in TNBC; Ii-Key, Licensing, Partnerships, investor dividend paid (1:4) for spin-out. 
• | NuGenerex Diagnostics: NGDx Express II rapid diagnostic tests for infectious disease. 

 
We believe that these legacy diagnostics, diabetes and cancer assets are may have significant value which is not being recognized due to missteps in the clinical development process by previous management, resulting inability to raise capital necessary to fund further development. We think the products and IP portfolio retain significant value. A recently signed co-development deal with a major pharmaceutical company for AE37 in triple negative breast cancer, and a licensing deal in China for AE37 in prostate cancer illustrate the potential for AE37 immunotherapeutic vaccine. Additionally, Oral-lyn has been reformulated to enter clinical trials for Type II diabetes. The HDS EXPRESS diagnostic technology has been expanded with the new, patent-pending EXPRESS II technology and a new product pipeline. We filled our first international commercial order for 40,000 units of its NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company, and were recently granted a CE Mark Certification under the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) for its The Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, a rapid point-of-care diagnostic assay for the detection of syphilis antibodies in primary and secondary syphilis. As part of the reorganization plan, we placed our legacy assets into separate subsidiaries under the NuGenerex family of companies, including NuGenerex Diagnostics, NGIO, and NuGenerex Therapeutics (Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery technology). Our strategy is to spin out NGIO as a separately traded public company, to reignite the Oral-Lyn development program with a reformulated buccal insulin spray, and to build out the diagnostics business, as detailed in the following paragraphs, however there are no assurances that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives.

NuGenerex Therapeutics
 NuGenerex Therapeutics houses the legacy diabetes assets, Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery technology. We believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to many large molecule drugs and designed to provide a convenient, non-invasive, accurate and cost-effective way to administer such drugs.
 
Buccal Delivery Technology and Products 
 Our buccal delivery technology involves the preparation of proprietary formulations in which an active pharmaceutical agent is placed in a solution with a combination of absorption enhancers and other excipients classified “generally recognized as safe” ("GRAS") by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) when used in accordance with specified quantities and other limitations. The resulting formulations are aerosolized with a pharmaceutical grade chemical propellant and are administered to patients using our proprietary RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler. The device is a small, lightweight, hand-held, easy-to-use aerosol applicator comprised of a container for the formulation, a metered dose valve, an actuator and dust cap. Using the device, patients self-administer the formulations by spraying them into the mouth. The device contains multiple applications, the number being dependent, among other things, on the concentration of the formulation. Absorption of the pharmaceutical agent occurs in the buccal cavity, principally through the inner cheek walls. In clinical studies of our flagship oral insulin product Generex Oral-lyn™, insulin absorption in the buccal cavity has been shown to be efficacious and safe.

Buccal Insulin Product – Generex Oral-Lyn™ 
 Insulin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas to regulate the level of glucose, a type of sugar, in the bloodstream. The term “diabetes” refers to a group of disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to properly regulate blood glucose levels. When glucose is abundant, it is converted into fat and stored for use when food is not available. When glucose is not available from food, these facts are broken down into free fatty acids that stimulate glucose production. Insulin acts by stimulating the use of glucose as fuel and by inhibiting the production of glucose. In a healthy individual, a balance is maintained between insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are two major types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes) refers to the condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5-10 percent of diabetes cases (CDC). It often occurs in children and young adults. Type 1 diabetics must take daily insulin injections, typically three to five times per day, to regulate blood glucose levels. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a needle-free means of delivering insulin for these patients.
 
According to the American Diabetes Association, in Type 2 diabetes (adult onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), the body does not produce enough insulin, or cannot properly use the insulin produced. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and accounts for 90-95 percent of diabetes cases, according to the American Diabetes Association. In addition to insulin therapy, Type 2 diabetics may take oral drugs that stimulate the production of insulin by the pancreas or that help the body to more effectively use insulin. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a simple means of delivering needed insulin to this major cohort of individuals.
 
Studies in diabetes have identified a condition closely related to and preceding diabetes, called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). People with IGT do not usually meet the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. They have normal fasting glucose levels but two hours after a meal their blood glucose level is far above normal. With the increase use of glucose tolerance tests the number of people diagnosed with this pre-diabetic condition is expanding exponentially. Per the 2017 Diabetes Atlas Update, published by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 40 million people in the United States and more than 425 million people world-wide suffer from IGT. Generex Oral-lyn™ is an ideal solution to providing meal-time insulin to the millions of IGT sufferers. This therapeutic area is currently being investigated.
 
There is no known cure for diabetes. The IDF estimates that there are currently approximately 382 million diabetics worldwide per their 2017 Diabetes Atlas Update and is expected to affect over 592 million people by the year 2035. There are estimated to be over 37 million people suffering from diabetes in North America alone and diabetes is the second largest cause of death by disease in North America.
 
A substantial number of large molecule drugs (i.e., drugs composed of molecules with a high molecular weight and fairly complex and large spatial orientation) have been approved for sale in the United States or are presently undergoing clinical trials as part of the process to obtain such approval, including various proteins, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, hormones and vaccines. Unlike small molecule drugs, which generally can be administered by various methods, large molecule drugs historically have been administered predominately by injection. The principal reasons for this have been the vulnerability of large molecule drugs to digestion and the relatively large size of the molecule itself, which makes absorption into the blood stream through the skin inefficient or ineffective. The RapidMist technology provides a recognized and proven drug delivery system for the delivery of large molecules directly into the blood stream with the attendant advantages.
 
Oral-lyn History
 In May 2005, we received approval from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ for treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We have successfully completed the delivery and installation of a turnkey Generex Oral-lyn™ production operation at the facilities of PharmaBrand in Quito, Ecuador. The first commercial production run of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Ecuador was completed in May 2006. While Ecuador production capability may be sufficient to meet the needs of South America, it is believed to be insufficient for worldwide production for future commercial sales and clinical trials.
 
On the basis of the test results in Ecuador and other pre-clinical data, we made an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) submission to Health Canada (Canada's equivalent to the FDA) in July 1998, and received permission from the Canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in September 1998. We filed an IND application with the FDA in October 1998, and received FDA approval to proceed with human trials in November 1998.

We began our clinical trial programs in Canada and the United States in January 1999. Between January 1999 and September 2000, we conducted clinical trials of our insulin formulation involving approximately 200 subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers. The study protocols in most trials involved administration of two different doses of our insulin formulation following either a liquid Sustacal meal or a standard meal challenge. The objective of these studies was to evaluate our insulin formulation's efficacy in controlling post-prandial (meal related) glucose levels. These trials demonstrated that our insulin formulation controlled post-prandial hyperglycemia in a manner comparable to injected insulin. In April 2003, a Phase II-B clinical trial protocol was approved in Canada. In September 2006, a Clinical Trial Application relating to our Generex Oral-lyn™ protocol for late-stage trials was approved by Health Canada. The FDA’s review period for the protocol lapsed without objection in July 2007.
 
In late April 2008, we initiated Phase III clinical trials in North America for Generex Oral-lyn™ with the first subject screening in Texas. Other clinical sites participating in the study were located in the United States (Texas, Maryland, Minnesota and California), Canada (Alberta), European Union (Romania, Poland and Bulgaria), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine),) and Ecuador. Approximately 450 subjects were enrolled in the program at approximately 70 clinical sites around the world. The Phase III protocol called for a six-month trial with a six-month follow-up with the primary objective to compare the efficacy of Generex Oral-lyn™ and the RapidMist™ Diabetes Management System with that of standard regular injectable human insulin therapy as measured by HbA1c, in patients with Type-1 diabetes mellitus. The final subjects completed the trial in August 2011. After appropriate validation, the data from approximately 450 patients was tabulated, reviewed and analyzed. Those results from the Phase III trial along with a comprehensive review and supplemental analyses of approximately 40 prior Oral-lyn clinical studies were compiled and submitted to the FDA in late December 2011 in a comprehensive package including a composite metanalysis of all safety data. We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials of Oral-lyn™ until after such time that we secure additional financing. However, we have undertaken a formulation enhancement project with the University Health Network at the University of Toronto and the University of Guelph, Ontario to increase the amount of insulin reaching the blood stream. We believe that the preliminary results from an animal study are encouraging,
 
In the past, we engaged a global clinical research organization to provide many study related site services, including initiation, communication with sites, project management and documentation; a global central lab service company to arrange for the logistics of kits and blood samples shipment and testing; an Internet-based clinical electronic data management company to assist us with global data entry, project management and data storage/processing of the Phase III clinical trial and regulatory processes. In the past, we have contracted with third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of the RapidMist™ components, the insulin, and the raw material excipients required for the production of clinical trial batches of Generex Oral-lyn™.
 
Future Plans
 We have reformulated the original Oral-Lyn buccal insulin as a new patentable Oral-Lyn 2 that requires only 2 - 3 pre-prandial (before meal) sprays for the treatment of Type II diabetes. The reformulated Oral-lyn 2 was made possible by new techniques in protein chemistry and pharmaceutical formulation science, that with minimal changes in the production process and content of the components, allow the development of a new and improved, concentrated insulin formulation for improved diabetes management.
 
NuGenerex has engaged the University of Toronto’s Center for Molecular Design and Pre-formulations (CMDP) through the University Health Network with the goal of enhancing the Oral-lyn™ 2 formulation to make it more attractive to patients and prospective commercialization partners by increasing the bioavailability of insulin in the product and reducing the number of sprays required to achieve effective prandial metabolic control for patients with diabetes. Under the supervision of NuGenerex consultant Dr. Lakshmi P. Kotra, B.Pharm. (Hons), Ph.D., of CMDP, preliminary efforts succeeded in increasing the insulin concentration in the product by approximately 400 - 500% as confirmed by a variety of in vitro testing procedures, while preserving the solubility, stability, biologic activity, and potency of the insulin in the formulation.

NuGenerex subsequently entered into a Research Services Agreement with the University of Guelph pursuant to which Dr. Dana Allen, DVM, MSc. and Dr. Ron Johnson, DVM, Ph.D. of the Ontario Veterinary College of the University of Guelph conducted a study of the relative bioavailability of the enhanced formulation in dogs in the University’s Comparative Clinical Research Facility. The University had previously conducted the studies of the original formulation of Generex Oral-lyn™ for proof of concept, safety, and toxicity.
 
In the new studies, the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn 2 formulation was compared with the original formulation in a blinded, parallel controlled study involving fasted, awake, healthy mature beagle dogs. Each dog received three sprays of either the enhanced formulation or the original formulation. Each dog was observed with assessments of serum insulin and glucose measured over a two-hour period. There were no adverse events observed in any of the animals.
 
In the dogs given the enhanced Generex Oral-lyn formulation (5X), there was a greater than 20-fold increase in serum insulin at 15 minutes (excluding one dog who had little response at any time point; (with dog included it was greater than 5-fold)) and almost 500% greater absorption of insulin over the two-hour test period compared to dogs given the original formulation (1X). There was a 33% decrease in serum glucose at 30 minutes in dogs treated with the enhanced Generex Oral-lyn™ formulation, compared to a 12% increase in serum glucose in dogs treated with the original formulation.
 
The results of the dog studies coupled with the positive findings from the in vitro work provide support and confidence to move forward with the remaining clinical and regulatory work necessary to achieve FDA approval of the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn formulation through a 505(b)2 NDA.
 
The combined results provide evidence that the enhanced NuGenerex Oral-lyn 2 will be able to be used by people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as a safe, simple, fast, flexible, and effective alternative to pre-prandial insulin injections with dosing of only two to four sprays required before meals.
 
The Oral-lyn Safety Database contains information on 1,496 subjects. Eight hundred sixty-nine (869) subjects were exposed to Oral-lyn, while 627 served as Control subjects and were exposed to commercially available oral antihyperglycemics, injected insulin, or Oral-lyn placebo. There were 695 subjects in pK/pD studies (368, Oral-lyn; 327, Control) and 801 subjects in efficacy trials (501, Oral-lyn; 300, Control).
 
Two hundred seventy-two (272) Oral-lyn subjects reported at least one adverse event (132 in pK/pD studies; 140 in efficacy studies) while 278 Control subjects reported at least one adverse event (111 in pK/pD studies; 167 in efficacy studies). With respect to adverse events by Maximum Severity there appeared to be no significant differences between Oral-lyn and the Control groups in either the Efficacy or the pK studies.
 
In summary, there appear to be no indications of any significant unexpected adverse events. The expected events of hypoesthesia oral, throat irritation, dry throat, and cough were for the most part mild and could be consistent with the Oral-lyn therapy especially during the learning phase of administration. There was an indication of overlap of some of these events with multiple event terms in the constellation of upper respiratory tract infection that appeared to be balanced across therapy groups.
 
Our strategy is to revitalize our diabetes program by advancing the reformulated buccal spray Oral-lyn 2 for the treatment of Type II diabetes, and to integrate Oral-Lyn 2 therapy into our end-to-end solution for disease management through our MSO model.
 
Beyond Oral-lyn 2 for Type II diabetes, we will advance the RapidMist buccal delivery technology with additional small and large molecule drugs which will benefit from an alternative route of administration.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, Inc.
 NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology is developing immunotherapeutic products and vaccines based on our proprietary, patented platform technology, Ii-Key. The Ii-Key is a peptide derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II associated invariant chain (Ii) that regulates the formation, trafficking, and antigen-presenting functions of MHC class II complexes, essential for the activation of T cells in the immune response. T cells recognize antigenic epitopes when they are 'presented' to them by specific molecules, termed (MHC) on the surface of infected or malignant cells. This interaction activates the T cells, stimulating a multicellular cascade of actions that eliminates the diseased cell and protects against future disease recurrence.

When the Ii-Key peptide is linked to an antigenic epitope, it can bind to MHC Class II molecules, displacing resident antigens from the antigen binding groove, essentially 'hijacking' the MHC class II complex to present the Ii-Key epitope to selectively activate T-Cell Th1 responses, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of the immune response.
 
The patented NGIO Ii-Key technology uses synthetic peptides that mimic antigenic protein regions from a virus or tumor biomarker that are chemically linked to the 4-amino acid Ii-Key to ensure robust immune system activation. In particular, the Ii-Key ensures potent activation of CD4+ T cells, which in turn facilitates antibody production to ward off infection. This Ii-Key modification can be applied to any protein fragment of any pathogen to increase the potency of immune stimulation.
 
NGIO has developed a number of Ii-Key Hybrid peptides for the immunotherapeutic targeting of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) in cancer and for vaccines against infectious diseases.
 
Ii-Key hybrid peptides can also be used to selectively activate Th2 responses and thereby induce tolerance to antigens involved in harmful immune reactions, e.g. autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant rejection.
 
AE37 – Ii-Key/HER2/neu Hybrid Immunotherapeutic Vaccine
 Our most advanced immunotherapy vaccine is AE37, an Ii-Key-Hybrid molecule that contains the HER2/neu antigenic peptide linked to the Ii-Key to enhance immune stimulation against HER2, which is expressed in numerous cancers, including breast, prostate, and bladder cancers. We have completed a Phase I clinical trial of AE37 in breast cancer: A phase Ib safety and immunology study of AE37 and GM-CSF in 16 breast cancer patients who had completed all first-line therapies and who were disease-free at the time of enrollment to the study (Holmes et al. Results of the first phase I clinical trial of the novel Ii-Key hybrid preventive HER-2/neu peptide (AE37) vaccine. J Clin Oncol 2008;26:3426-33). Furthermore, we completed a Phase IIb trial of AE37 in the prevention of cancer recurrence in women who were at high risk of recurrence after undergoing successful primary standard of care breast cancer therapies and were disease free at time of enrollment. The final results of the Phase IIb clinical trial of AE37 +/- GM-CSF vaccine for the prevention of recurrence of breast cancer have been published in the peer-reviewed journal, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment. In the AE37 arm of this trial, the investigators found that patients with advanced stage, HER2 under-expression, and TNBC may benefit from AE37 vaccination, and those with both advanced stage and HER2 under expression have a significant clinical benefit to AE37 vaccination, demonstrating earlier DFS plateau that was maintained for up to the ten years of follow-up.
 
Based on the results from this trial, NuGenerex has entered into a collaborative agreement with Merck Sharpe & Dohme B.V. (Merck) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Prostate Program (NSABP) to conduct a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AE37 in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The trial is scheduled to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2019. As the clinical trial continues, NGIO will be obligated to pay NSABP, pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, additional amounts during each completed phase in the increments and at the times set forth in the agreement up to $2,118,461 upon NASBP achieving certain milestones in four primary phases: Start-Up Activities, Accrual and Treatment Period, Follow-up Period and Primary Endpoint. As of July 31, 2020, we have incurred $591,459 of expenses against this commitment.
 
In addition to the breast cancer program, NuGenerex has conducted a Phase I clinical trial in prostate cancer, enrolling thirty-two HER-2/neu+, castrate-sensitive, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients to demonstrate safety and strong immunological response to AE37. We are advancing AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer through a licensing and  research agreement with Shenzhen BioScien  Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., for which NuGenerex has received a $700,000 upfront payment which was recognized as revenue during the Company’s fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, with additional future milestone and royalty payments.
 
In exchange for exclusive rights to AE37 for prostate cancer in China, Shenzhen is financing and conducting the Phase II trials in the European Union and Phase III trials globally under ICH guidelines, with NuGenerex retaining the rights to all clinical data for regulatory submissions and commercialization in the rest of the world outside China.

Future Plans
 NGIO has been established to not only to advance the NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology core technology, but also to expand our portfolio in the field of immunotherapy and personalized medicine through partnerships and acquisitions. As part of our strategy, we are planning to spin-out NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology as a separate, publicly traded entity to unlock the true value of the Ii-Key technology for our stockholders as it creates a pure play in immunotherapy, which will foster investment and collaboration.
 
NGIO, has 750,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, 400,300,000 of which are outstanding, and prior to the stock dividends completed by Generex, were held by Generex. Generex has completed two stock dividends of such shares. On February 25, 2019, the Company distributed an aggregate of 15,089,271 (approximately 3.8%) of such shares to Generex stockholders. Pursuant to this dividend, our shareholders received 1 share of NGIO for every 4 shares of our stock held by the stockholders. On February 24, 2020, Generex completed a second distribution under which Generex distributed an aggregate of 19,026,262 NGIO shares to Generex shareholders. Under this second dividend, shareholders received 2 shares of NGIO stock for every 5 shares of Generex held by the shareholders. Generex’s current ownership of NGIO stock is 364,003,151 shares (approximately 90.93%). As of July 31, 2020, NGIO reported total assets of $84 consisting of cash. The Company believes that NGIO’s most valuable asset is its internally developed intellectual property. However, the internally developed intellectual property has not met the criteria for capitalization and accordingly, the Company has not recorded any such costs on its balance sheet.
 
Generex owns 364,003,151 of the aggregate 400,300,000 outstanding NGIO shares, or approximately 90.93% of NGIO’s outstanding shares. Generex may, in the future, sell some of its shares of NGIO, but Generex does not currently anticipate that its ownership level of NGIO will fall below 51%.
 
Additionally, we are in discussions with multiple academic institutions and biotechnology development companies to acquire products and technologies to augment the NGIO development pipeline and product portfolio.
 
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, NGIO has been working to develop a peptide vaccine against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using the company’s proprietary and patented Ii-Key immune system activation technology. We have built our technology to assist third party groups and government agencies in their evaluation of potential vaccines against this pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus.
 
Generex is working with our partners at EpiVax who have identified such protein fragments or epitopes to generate Ii-Key-SARS 2 peptide vaccines in collaboration with our peptide manufacturing partners. The peptides and Ii-Key are made from naturally occurring amino acids, ensuring an excellent safety profile for Ii-Key peptide vaccines. If NGIO is successful in obtaining government funding for the Ii-Key-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine program, the company plans to advance vaccine candidates through the clinical development process and BLA approval.
 
We plan to finalize the public offering and apply for listing to a national stock exchange for NGIO in 2020.
 
On March 12, 2020, NGIO filed a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has become effective and NGIO is subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements. In the near future, NGIO intends to file an application to have its common stock listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics (formerly Hema Diagnostic Systems LLC)
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, NuGenerex Diagnostics is in the business of developing, manufacturing, and distributing rapid point-of-care in-vitro medical diagnostics for infectious diseases. These are commonly referred as rapid diagnostic tests (“RDTs”). We manufacture and sell RDTs based upon our own proprietary EXPRESS platforms as well as standard “cassette” devices.
 
Since its founding, NuGenerex Diagnostics has been developing and continues to develop an expanding line of RDTs for infectious disease diagnosis. These include products for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and others. These assays are all qualitative in nature and provide a simple positive or negative result directly at the clinical site. They can be used for definitive diagnosis, triage or in combination with other assays depending on which disease is being considered.
 
Each device incorporates a test strip containing reagent lines (stripes) that have been impregnated with specific antigens or antibodies that detect the target molecules specific to an infectious disease. The test strips are incorporated into our proprietary EXPRESS platforms which are easy-to-use and user-friendly diagnostic devices. There are two EXPRESS platforms; the EXPRESS and the EXPRESS II. The EXPRESS II is an upgraded version of the original EXPRESS and its use involves fewer operator steps, making it of higher clinical utility value. The Express II platform is designed to be used in a broad range of clinical and laboratory medical settings and for direct use by consumers in the home. It is simple to use, with fewer steps of operation than other rapid point-of-care tests. A single drop of blood taken by a simple finger stick is added directly to the device and the assay is activated by placing a pod of buffer solution onto the device. Results can be read in as early as 5 minutes, and no longer than 30 minutes. The accuracy of the Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay is equal to or better than standard laboratory assays for syphilis antibodies with sensitivities and specificities of over 99%.
 
We believe that each system delivers its own advantages which enhance the use, application and performance of each diagnostic. This ease of use in the EXPRESS delivery systems is designed to ensure that our RDTs perform efficiently and effectively providing the most accurate and repeatable test results available while, at the same time, minimizing the transference of a potentially infected blood sample. The EXPRESS and cassette diagnostic kits for infectious disease testing are designed for use in resource-poor countries throughout the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Health Organization coordinates population screening for infectious diseases. We recently filled our first international commercial order for 40,000 units of its NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company.

NuGenerex Diagnostics was recently granted a CE Mark Certification under the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) for its The Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, a rapid point-of-care diagnostic assay for the detection of syphilis antibodies in primary and secondary syphilis. The assay is based upon NuGenerex Diagnostic’s innovative patent pending point-of-care diagnostic platform, the Express II. The accuracy of the Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay is equal to or better than standard laboratory assays for syphilis antibodies with sensitivities and specificities of over 99%.
 With the receipt of the CE Mark Certification for its rapid point-of-care Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay, we believe NuGenerex Diagnostics is well situated to enter into this growing syphilis testing market and will now pursue marketing efforts in Europe and, in parallel, begin plans for the filing of a 510k application with the United States FDA for marketing clearance in the United States. To this end, NuGenerex Diagnostics is fully qualified as a diagnostic test developer and manufacturer under FDA Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP) and is certified by the International Standards Organization for the manufacture of medical devices under ISO 13485-2016 regulations.
 
NuGenerex Diagnostics has just begun a new initiative which revolves around the development of quantitative rapid diagnostic assays. These assays allow laboratory personnel and clinicians to assess the absolute amount of specific target molecules in blood or serum samples as opposed to “yes” or “no” results of qualitative RDTs. The first assay to be developed is a multiplex biomarker test for the diagnosis of sepsis and the potential differentiation of infectious sepsis from systemic immune response syndrome (SIRS).
 
We maintain an FDA registered facility in Miramar, Florida and are certified under both ISO9001 and ISO13485 for the Design, Development, Production and Distribution of the in-vitro devices. Approval of our HIV rapid test has been issued by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Additionally, some of our products qualified for and carry the European Union “CE” Mark, which allows us to enter into CE Member countries subject to individual country requirements. Currently, we have two malaria rapid tests approved under World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. This process allows expedited approval of rapid tests, reducing the current 24 -30-month process down to approximately 6-9 months. WHO approval is necessary for our products to be used in those countries which rely upon the expertise of the WHO, as well as for non-governmental organizations (“NGO”) funding for the purchase of diagnostic products. NuGenerex Diagnostics had planned to initiate the development of rapid testing for COVID-19, but due to lack of funding has not been able to initiate this development as planned.
 
We maintain current U.S. Certificates of Exportability that are issued by two FDA divisions-CBER and CDRH. CBER (Center for Biologicals Evaluation and Research) is the FDA regulatory division that oversees infectious disease diagnostic devices, including our HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C EXPRESS and EXPRESS II kits. The other division, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is responsible for the oversight of other HDS devices which include Tuberculosis, Syphilis, and the remaining product line. Our HDS facility maintains FDA Establishment Registration status and is in accord with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) as confirmed by the FDA.
 
We do not currently have FDA clearance to sell our products in the United States. We intend to submit selected devices to the FDA under a Pre-Market Approval Application (PMA) or through the 510K process. The 510K would require the appropriate regulatory administrative submissions as well as a limited scientific review by the FDA to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); in-depth scientific, regulatory, and Quality System review by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee (panel review); and final deliberations, documentation, and notification of the FDA decision. The PMA process is more extensive, requiring clinical trials to support the application. We expect to apply to the FDA for clearance of our first RDT (Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay) for FDA 510K approval in early 2020. We anticipate the FDA process will be completed within 9 months after submission. During this timeline, we will be preparing documentation for additional rapid tests to undergo either the FDA PMA or 510k process. 
 
Future Plans 
 We plan to use the NuGenerex Diagnostics subsidiary to build a multi-faceted diagnostics business focused on personalized medicine. To that end, we are exploring opportunities in multiplex assays for point-of-care infectious disease testing, pharmacogenomic testing for medication management, and biomarker analysis for personalized cancer treatment, including immunotherapy.

NDS Expansion
 The NuGenerex MSO network has operated in five states and is configuring a roll out which will be compliant and reduce healthcare costs through better outcomes. Those organizations which invest in our new MSO model will be aligned solely with our shareholders and will receive discount codes to procure our products such as Excellagen.
 
DME-IQ
 NDS is planning a launch DME-IQ, a novel software as a service (SaaS) solution for physicians to manage in-office distribution of durable medical equipment (DME). DME-IQ supports the development and management of compliant and profitable in-office DME programs. DME-IQ focuses on several key areas which include negotiating on behalf of the physicians with key vendors to decrease the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), increasing insurance collections by providing oversight of the coding during the billing process, providing the necessary personnel to manage the appeals processes, and ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations.
 
DME-IQ will automate and provide the orthopedic practices with a proprietary, tablet-based software package that immediately verifies patient benefits and eligibility. This unique system manages DME inventory, collects patient copays and deductibles, and links patient information with the DME products and necessary patient forms all in one easy to use platform.
 
The DME Market
 
The US market for DME is large and growing, a result of several factors including the rising prevalence of chronic diseases requiring long-term care, the rapidly growing geriatric population, and the trend toward home healthcare services. Chronic disorders such as diabetes, diabetic foot & pressure ulcers, chronic pain, and cancer that require long-term patient care and postoperative recovery are driving demand for DME. According to a 2018 market report by Grand View Research, Inc., the US DME market is expected to reach $70.8 billion by 2025, growing at a 6.0% CAGR during the forecast period.
 
DME-IQ tracks and maintains DME inventory to ensure an adequate supply and product mix for orthopedic patient populations, and the system facilitates insurance claim submissions and adjudication to help achieve optimal reimbursements. With the DME-IQ system, the practice gains control of their DME program from an operations and financial perspective, while patients gain access to a wider variety of DME products that are custom fitted for their needs.
 
The explosion of high deductible insurance plans has resulted in a dramatic increase of patient out-of-pocket payments for care, and the subsequent requirement that physicians spend more time as collection agents rather than doctors. DME-IQ provides practice workflow solutions for DME with custom, tablet-based software that removes the administrative burden from the practice, facilitating patient eligibility review, collection of patient co-pay and deductibles, centralized insurance adjudication, DME product procurement, and other support services that allow physician practices to increase revenue and service quality. The launch of DME-IQ advances the mission of NDS to provide physicians with end-to-end solutions for patient centric care.”

Regentys Corporation
 Our majority-owned subsidiary, Regentys Corporation is a regenerative medicine company developing a tissue engineered therapy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. 
 
Overview
 In January 2019, we acquired a majority interest in Regentys Corporation, a Florida corporation, a development-stage regenerative medicine company. Since its formation in May 2013 as Asana Medical Inc., Regentys has been developing a first-in-class tissue engineered therapies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases.
Ulcerative Colitis
 According to an article that was published in The Lancet on December 23, 2018 named worldwide incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the 21st century: a systematic review of population-based studies. (2018 Dec 23;390(10114):2769-2778), ulcerative colitis (or UC) affects an estimated 3.2 million patients in Europe, the United States and Japan. It is a chronic, inflammatory disease that causes sores or ulcers in the lining of the large intestine (the colon). Immunological in nature, UC is thought to be facilitated by a variety of hereditary, genetic and environmental factors and it is increasingly being diagnosed in more urbanized areas. Symptoms, including urgency, bleeding, and diarrhea, that substantially affect quality of life.
Regentys™ Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel (“ECMH”)
 Regentys’ initial product, ECMH™ Rectal Solution, is a first-in-class, non-pharmacologic, non-surgical treatment option for millions of patients suffering from mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.  Its product candidate is a powder that is reconstituted with saline and delivered as a liquid via enema. As ECMH reaches body temperature, it gels and coats the mucosal lining of the GI tract. 
 
 The core technology is derived from ECM, a safe and effective FDA-approved base now extensively used for surgical applications and wound treatment. ECMH acts as a bio-scaffold, separating the damaged tissue from waste flow, covering ulcerations to limit the inflammatory response, and facilitating a healing environment using endogenous (the body’s own) stem cells.
 
Pre-Clinical Results
 Published pre-clinical results in the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis highlight Regentys technology. Animal data show the ECMH therapy can both alleviate clinical symptoms and facilitate healing in UC patients. Previous pre-clinical ECM animal data for approved products has been shown to have a high correlation with human data.
 
Competition
 Currently four biologics are FDA-approved, including top-selling antibody medicines Humira® (adalimumab), Simponi® (golimumab), Remicade® (infliximab) and Entyvio® (vedolizumab), all of which act to suppress the pro-inflammatory protein, TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha), a leading cause of the proliferation of ulcerative colitis and other forms of IBD. However, even with these options, more than half of all UC patients do not achieve long-term remission. Moreover, 20-30% of non-responsive patients will undergo colon removal surgery in an attempt to remediate the disease.

Regentys Advantages
 We expect our product to offer a true alternative to patients non-responsive to first line therapies such as 5-ASA. Unresponsive patients will then need to choose among therapies that alter the body’s immune system or pose long term health risks or perhaps both. Regentys’ technology is expected to enable targeted tissue healing but pose none of the health risks of more expensive market-leading biologics that generally suppress the immune system. We expect to provide our therapy at a cost less than other therapies.
Market
 In 2023, when we expect to receive approval, the projected drug costs for UC alone are expected to exceed $7.5B globally according to a 2017 report by Allied Market Research; including other inflammatory bowel disease indications, the global market is expected to be double the UC market. Based upon the nature of IBD, and the characteristics of Regentys’ technology, management believes variations of Regentys’ core technology will also be effective in treating IBD diseases such as Crohn’s, rectal mucositis, proctitis and anal fissures.
Intellectual Property
 Regentys in-licensed patents and co-developed its technology platform with the University of Pittsburgh. It now holds patent rights in US and foreign jurisdictions, and has other global filings pending; as well, it has patent applications pending for similar indications predicated on its existing technology in other major global markets.
Regulatory Path 
 The FDA has affirmed our approach to file a 510(k) de novo application on its ECM hydrogel. We have developed a protocol and have engaged a clinical research organization to manage the conduct of its first-in-human clinical trials expected to start in Q2/Q3 2021 in Australia. Additionally, we have engaged consultants to assist in managing the trials and regulatory approval process in Australia, the US and Europe, jurisdictions in which we initially expect to undertake clinical trials and, among other markets, where it will first seek governmental approval to promote and sell medical devices.
Product Development 
 Since 2013, we have maintained a research and development agreement with the University of Pittsburgh supplemented with personnel from the affiliated McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine. In February 2018, Regentys entered into a development agreement with (and has received a co-investment by) Cook Biotech, Inc., a global leader in ECM manufacturing technology (CookBio). Product batches now on hand are expected to be sufficient for additional development and testing. A larger clinical batch with finalized specifications will be generated in the coming months for use in clinical trials. There are alternate providers of development services who can assist with product development activities. Notwithstanding these options, management believes that because of the nature of ongoing development activities, and the reliance upon certain bench and manufacturing processes and ECM product expertise and technology, any interruption in the development relationship with CookBio would subject the Company to substantial expenditures of time and cost to duplicate the product.
Manufacturing 
 Regentys has an exclusive manufacturing agreement with CookBio for the production of biomaterial and use of its proprietary technology conditioned upon the completion of final product development work. Management has negotiated an agreement with a third-party manufacturer for product components and kitting. We believe that there are alternate sources of these manufacturing and supply services. However, because of the nature of regulation in the medical device industry, and the reliance upon the collection, reporting and management of medical device manufacturing data, a change of manufacturer would substantially impact the time and cost required for clinical product production and regulatory compliance.

Financing 
 In January 2019, Regentys was acquired by Generex for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000, with $400,000 paid in upfront cash up-front and a promissory note of $14,600,000. Installments payable under the note were tied to specific business development objectives and dates. As October 3, 2019, an additional $850,000 was paid for a total of $1,250,000 against the note. Regentys entered into an accommodation agreement dated March 14, 2019 with Generex to provide longer time to pay. On November 25, 2019, the payment due date for the first three installments was extended to December 30, 2019 and extended on January 10, 2020 further to January 31, 2020. A Fourth Payment of $5,000,000 was due on or about February 1, 2020 (which has not been paid) and the final payment of $1,150,000 payable on or about February 1, 2021. Interest has been accruing at 4% per annum with a balance of $858,159, of which $375,389 is included in noncontrolling interest on the balance sheet as of July 31, 2020. The last payments of $115,000 and $120,000 were made on October 21, 2020 and October 30, 2020, respectively.
Operations 
 Currently, Regentys employs four full-time contract employee and several part-time consultants. We supplement our business operations by engaging external legal (intellectual property, corporate and health care), accounting and tax professionals. We also have contracted with information services, regulatory and clinical trial companies who make available professionals to manage the information services, regulatory, clinical, and compliance aspects of the business. Upon payment of the interim note, Regentys will formally add two contract employees, additional administrative staff and a third-party provider to assist with employee payroll and benefits as well as undertake clinical trial activities suing external support.
NuGenerex Surgical Products
 Pantheon Medical and MediSource Partners
 Pantheon Medical (“Pantheon”) is a manufacturer of orthopedic foot & ankle surgery kits that offer physician friendly “all-in-one,” integrated surgical kits that include plates, screws, and tools required for orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists conducting foot and ankle surgeries.
 
MediSource Partners, LLC (“MediSource Partners”) is a 10-year old private company that is an FDA registered distributor of surgical, medical, and biologic supplies, with over 25 vendor contracts for nationwide distribution of implants and devices for spine, hips, knees, foot, ankle, hand, and wrist surgeries. Additional product lines include biologics (blood, bone, tissue, stem cells), durable medical equipment, and soft goods. We maintain partnerships and contracts with hospital systems for ordering, billing and inventory management.
 
The asset acquisitions of Pantheon and MediSource Partners were finalized on August 1, 2019. NuGenerex Surgical (aka MediSource) has contracts with over 25 vendors (including Pantheon Medical) for distribution of:
 

• | Implants and devices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Biologics (blood, bone, tissue, and stem cells). 
• | Durable medical equipment. 
• | Soft Goods. 
• | Kits to process bone marrow aspirates and platelet rich plasma biologics.

Historical Background
 MediSource Partners was founded in 2009 and designed to be unique amongst its competitors by operating as a service-focused, “one stop shop” for the healthcare professionals it serves. With over 25,000 products in its catalogue, including thirteen (13) lines dedicated to spine, MediSource prides itself on its ability to service everything from small private practices across several disciplines, to entire hospital systems. The large and broad-based inventory allows our client physicians to “customize” their operating environment by selecting and implementing the hardware, biologics, soft goods and ancillary tools they feel most confident in and comfortable with. In addition, the “one stop shop” model reduces the burden placed on support staff tasked with managing multiple reps from multiple vendors and shortens the distribution chain to reduce costs and potential redundancies. The success of this model is demonstrated in MediSource’s ability to offer this client-focused, low-impact service at a pricing matrix often below even standard GPO pricing, thus increasing client profitability and productivity.
 
Pantheon Medical was founded in 2014 to build a manufacturing company with proprietary product lines that offer convenience and cost effectiveness to physicians. Pantheon is contracted with MediSource Partners for nationwide distribution of its proprietary “All-in-One” Foot & Ankle Surgery Kit.
 
Product Development
 Pantheon Medical is developing proprietary surgical systems to expand the product line. Over the next three years Pantheon will be developing three new product lines for submission to the FDA for 510K clearance, including Cannulated Screws, a Hammertoe System and Surgical Staples. Additionally, MediSource Partners will distribute a line of regenerative medicine products under development by an affiliated organization licensed for the production of biologics, including umbilical cord blood and Wharton’s Jelly (rich sources of stem cells), mesenchymal stem cells, and human placental derived tissue factors, primarily exosomes.
 
The acquisitions of Pantheon and MediSource Partners expands the commercial product portfolio of Generex into the surgical field, adding revenues and profits with their current product line and significant upside opportunities for new FDA-approved product introductions over the next several years. The MSO partners in NuGenerex Distribution Solutions, many of whom are orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists, will immediately benefit from Pantheon’s foot & ankle surgery kit.
 
NuGenerex Health, LLC
 In addition to our efforts in orthopedic medicine, we are currently in the process of setting up NuGenerex Health MSO to provide ancillary health services in partnership with Arizona Endocrinology Center and Paradise Valley Family Medicine, two major physician practices that care for a population of ~65,000 patients, approximately 25,000 of whom are insulin dependent diabetics with chronic care needs. With an initial focus on the management of complex diabetes patients, NuGenerex Health will offer ophthalmology, podiatry, chronic care management (CCM) services to provide patients with integrated, concierge care to improve outcomes and reduce costs. NuGenerex Health will employ ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and medical staff to provide ancillary health services for chronic care diabetes patients in support of the endocrinology and family medicine practices. By bringing the specialty ancillary care directly to the patients who regularly visit the clinic, we anticipate that NuGenerex Health will provide an integrated, collaborative care model to not only enhance patient wellbeing, but also to comply with CMS guidelines for diabetes and chronic care management that can lead to 5-star ratings and increased reimbursements.

On September 24, 2020, NuGenHealth, LLC, a subsidiary of Generex Biotechnology Corporation, signed a services agreement with Paradise Valley Family Medicine, P.C. an Arizona professional corporation (“PVFM”) to provide a software and services solution for patient engagement, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM) services that are recommended and reimbursed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Under the terms of the Agreement, NuGenerex Health will implement the company’s software system and connected metabolic monitoring devices, and will provide RPM and CCM services to Medicare patients with chronic medical conditions who are under the care of PVFM physicians. PVFM will bill CMS for the RPM and CCM services, and will pay software and service fees to NuGenerex Health.
 
Ophthalmology
 
Regular eye exams for persons diagnosed with diabetes mellitus are important for detecting potentially treatable vision loss. Monitoring, surveillance, and evaluation of visual health are widely recognized as prerequisites for effective, accessible, and high-quality individual and population-based health services.
 
Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers preventive and diagnostic eye exams as part of a comprehensive diabetes care plan, with reimbursements averaging $215 per patient for standard eye exam with accompanying tests for glaucoma and macular degeneration.

Podiatry
 According to an article that was published in Therapeutics Advances Endocrinology & Metabolism, Financial burden of diabetic foot ulcers to world: a progressive topic to discuss always(2018 Jan; 9(1): 29–31.), as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation costing an estimated $13 billion annually, CMS promotes preventive and diagnostic foot exams by a podiatrist, with reimbursement rates averaging $175 for a new patient evaluation, and $150 for follow up. Under the CMS guidelines, patients are eligible for diabetic foot exams every six months.
Chronic Care Management (CCM)
 According to the CDC an estimated 117 million adults have one or more chronic health conditions, and 2/3 of Medicare patients have 2 or more chronic conditions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) made benefit payments of $583 billion in 2018, with chronic care patients accounting for 99% of expenditures. Recognizing chronic care management (CCM) as a critical component of health care, CMS has established reimbursement codes to promote adoption in the marketplace, including significant improvements in 2017 that increased payment amounts and introduced new billing codes. NuGenerex Health is designed to provide comprehensive ancillary services to fill the current gaps in care that lead to significant morbidity and astronomical costs of diabetes.
 
Once the model is established for the diabetes population in Arizona, NuGenerex Health plans to expand to other states.
 
NuGenerex Health HMO
 We are in the process of building the final link in our corporate mission to provide physicians, hospitals, and all healthcare providers with an end-to-end solution for patient centric care from rapid diagnosis through delivery of personalized therapies, streamlining care processes, minimizing expenses, and delivering transparency for payers.
 
Generex intends to establish NuGenerex Health a multi-specialty Management Services Organization (MSO) that will serve as in-network providers for a health maintenance organization (HMO) that provides healthcare services and disease management solutions for patients living with chronic medical conditions. NuGenerex Health will serve patients with Chronic Special Needs Plans (C-SNP) and Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans under Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part B and Part D. In doing this, Generex intends to partner with an experienced HMO developer. Following the roadmap established by this partner in building some of the most successful HMO companies in recent history, NuGenerex plans to generate significant membership growth by developing patient centric engagement programs and building on our strong provider relationships. The HMO infrastructure will be managed by an industry-leading back office management company, which has provided back-end services for HMOs since 2009.
 
Contemplated Product Positioning and Plan Design
 Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plan (MAPD) HMO for individuals who have both Medicare Part A and Part B. This plan caters to individuals that prefer an all-inclusive product that covers Part C, Part D, and additional supplemental benefits at a low plan premium amount.
 
Chronic Special Needs Plan (CSNP) HMO for individuals in addition to having Medicare Part A and Part B are faced with the burden of living with diabetes or a cardiovascular disorder. This plan is offered to individuals that prefer an all-inclusive product that covers Part C, Part D, and additional supplemental benefits at a low plan premium amount.
 
Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (DSNP) HMO for individuals that have both Medicare Part A and Part B and medical assistance through their state of residence. This plan is offered to individuals that prefer an all-inclusive product that covers Part C, Part D, and additional supplemental benefits with no monthly plan premium.
 
NuGenerex Health D-SNP HMO Full will cover all Medicare-covered benefits at zero cost-sharing. In addition to the base supplemental products, the plan also offers routine foot care, and transportation.

Government Regulation
 
Regulatory Considerations for Generex
 
Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada, the EMEA in Europe, and comparable designated regulatory authorities in other countries. Among other things, extensive regulations require us to satisfy numerous conditions before we can bring products to market. While these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry, having a technology that is unique and novel extends the requisite review period by the various divisions within the FDA and other regulators. Also, other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products that still need to be approved by government regulators, as we are now.
 
If we do no obtain and maintain requisite regulatory approvals, our business will be substantially harmed. In many cases, we expect that extant and prospective development partners will participate in the regulatory approval process. The following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the United States and other countries as they affect our business.
 
United States
 
All aspects of our research, development and foreseeable commercial activities relating to medical device, biologic, and pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. United States federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory approval process, including clinical trials, usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed.
 
The steps required before a medical device, biologic or pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

24
--

 

Quality and pre-clinical tests and studies include: laboratory evaluation of Drug Substance and Drug Product chemistry, formulation/manufacturing, and stability profiling, as well as a large number of animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. The results of the quality and pre-clinical tests/studies, in addition to any non-clinical pharmacology, are submitted to the FDA along with the initial clinical study protocol (see descriptive of process below) as part of the initial IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to it, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA reviews all protocols, protocol amendments, adverse event reports, study reports, and annual reports in connection with a new pharmacological product.
 
The IND for our oral insulin formulation became effective in November 1998. Amendments are also subsequently filed as new Clinical Studies and their corresponding Study Protocols are proposed. In July 2007, we received a no objection clearance to initiate our Phase III study protocol for our oral insulin product.
 
The Physician’s Investigational New Drug Application for the Phase 1 and Phase II trial of AE37, NGIO’s synthetic peptide vaccine designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the HER-2/neu oncogene, in patients with stage II HER-2/neu positive breast cancer became effective in March 2006. 
 
The Investigational New Drug Application for the Phase II trial of AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda) for treatment of triple negative breast cancer became effective in December 2018, and the trial has begun enrolling patients.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of a new drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators. The protocols for the trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Also, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III), but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects, but usually not effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. When a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate and confirm clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations. The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials (known as “Pivotal Trials”). The successful completion of Phase III clinical trials is a mandatory step in the approval process for the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of products.
 
In the United States, the results of quality, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use. The NDA is far more specific than the IND and must also include proposed labeling and detailed technical sections based on the data collected. The FDA is governed by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act regarding response time to the application, which is generally 12 months (and shorter for a priority application). It may deny a NDA if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA also may require additional clarifications on the existing application or even additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug. We cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive FDA approval. The multi-tiered approval process means that our products could fail to advance to subsequent steps without the requisite data, studies, and FDA approval along the way. Even if approved by the FDA, our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the FDA.
 
To supply drug products for use in the United States, foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with, and be approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing facilities must also comply with the FDA's cGMPs, and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. Products manufactured outside the United States are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the FDA. To comply with cGMPs, manufacturers must expend substantial funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control. The FDA stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing. Discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance. These include restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawals of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

One final hurdle that is closely associated with the cGMP inspections is the pre-approval inspection that the FDA carries out prior to the issuance of a marketing license. FDA inspectors combine cGMP compliance with a review of research and development documents that were used in the formal NDA. A close inspection of historic data is reviewed to confirm data and to demonstrate that a company has carried out the activities as presented in the NDA. This is generally a long inspection and requires a team of individuals from the Company to “host” the FDA inspector(s).
 
Foreign Countries
 
Before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the United States, those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the FDA.  These requirements vary widely from country to country. Generally, however, no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been submitted by a sponsor and approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. Again, similar to the FDA, each country will mandate a specific financial consideration for the Marketing Application dossiers being submitted. Although an important consideration, FDA approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. We have received a number of foreign regulatory approval for the first generation Oral-lyn buccal insulin and over-the-counter products in the past, however, Oral-Lyn was never launched, and we are not manufacturing, marketing, nor distributing products in these regions based upon these approvals.
 
In May 2019, NuGenerex Diagnostics filled an international order for 40,000 units of its malarial diagnostic product, The NGDx -Malaria PF/PV Cassette Test Kit to Imres, BV, a Netherlands-based medical distribution company. The kits were part of a World Health Organization contract. That contract is fulfilled, and the contract has expired.
 
We have relocated our headquarters from Canada to the United States, but we maintain our Canadian entity, Generex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This entity contains all the intellectual property for the entire history of our Oral-Lyn diabetic products and patents for buccal delivery. There are no live operations in Canada, but we continue with an office. Also, temporarily, our Banking Operations are housed at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and will be replaced by a USA based public company treasury platform with JP Morgan Chase.
 
We have a few international initiatives that we continue to pursue in regard to development of new drugs, however, no international clinical trials are currently being conducted. Moving forward, we will pursue international development of promising drug candidates, with the goal of out-licensing those products to local companies or to international pharmaceutical companies for marketing and distribution in those countries, particularly in the European Union and Japan represent major markets for pharmaceutical and diagnostic products. To that end, we are in frequent contact with international countries with interests in licensing agreements with us on some of our products. Currently we have a licensing agreement with Shen Zhen BioScien for the rights to our cancer vaccine AE37 for the treatment of prostate cancer in China.
 
NGDx Regulatory Considerations 
 
The manufacturing and marketing of our existing and proposed diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. Our products are also regulated by, subject to approval by, or must meet standards set by, certain non-governmental organizations involved in the purchase and distribution of products like ours. These regulations and standards govern almost all aspects of development, production and marketing, including product testing, authorizations to market, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and record keeping.  
 
Commercialization of medical devices in the European Union requires meeting the regulatory guidelines of the European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and fulfillment of those requirements allows a device to carry the “CE-Mark” as verification of its diagnostic authenticity.
 
FDA-regulated products require some form of action by that agency before they can be marketed in the United States, and, after approval or clearance, we must continue to comply with other FDA requirements applicable to marketed products, e.g. Quality Systems (for medical devices). Failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements can lead to significant penalties, both before and after approval or clearance.

There are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive FDA clearance or approval. Some products may qualify for clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, in which the manufacturer provides a pre-market notification that it intends to begin marketing the product, and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product (i.e., that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness). In some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence.  
 
If the medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) procedure (either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device or because it is required by statute and the FDA’s implementing regulations have an approved application), the FDA must approve a Pre-Marketing Application (“PMA") before marketing can begin. PMA’s must demonstrate, among other matters, that the medical device provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. A PMA application is typically a complex submission, including the results of non-clinical and clinical studies. Preparing a PMA application is a much more expensive, detailed and time-consuming process as compared with a 510(K) pre-market notification.  
 
In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices that have not been cleared for marketing in the United States. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act contains general requirements for any medical device that may not be sold in the United States and is intended for export. Specifically, a medical device intended for export is not deemed to be adulterated or misbranded if the product: (1) complies with the specifications of the foreign purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export; (3) is prominently labeled on the outside of the shipping package that it is intended for export; and (4) is not sold or offered for sale in the United States. However, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does permit the export of devices to any country in the world, if the device complies with the laws of the importing country and has valid marketing authorization in one of several " listed " countries under the theory that these listed countries have sophisticated mechanisms for the review of medical devices for safety and effectiveness.
 
We are also subject to regulations in foreign countries governing products, human clinical trials and marketing, and may need to obtain approval or evaluations by international public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, in order to sell diagnostic products in certain countries.  Approval processes vary from country to country, and the length of time required for approval or to obtain other clearances may in some cases be longer than that required for United States governmental approvals. On the other hand, the fact that our HIV diagnostic tests are of value in the AIDS epidemic may lead to some government process being expedited.  The extent of potentially adverse governmental regulation affecting NGDx that might arise from future legislative or administrative action cannot be predicted.
 
Our products may rely on international regulatory approvals for sale into markets outside of the USA, and, domestically, our devices would require FDA clearance and in some cases, WHO Listings.
 
We intend to focus on both the domestic and international regulatory approvals. 
 
Domestically, we intend to submit our devices to the FDA under a PMA or through the 510K process. The 510K would require the appropriate regulatory administrative submissions as well as a limited scientific review by the FDA to determine completeness (acceptance and filing reviews); in-depth scientific, regulatory, and Quality System review by appropriate FDA personnel (substantive review); review and recommendation by the appropriate advisory committee (panel review); and final deliberations, documentation, and notification of the FDA decision. The PMA process is more extensive, requiring clinical trials to support the application. We expect to apply to FDA for approval of our first RDT to be submitted to the FDA for 510K approval within the next 3 months. We anticipate the FDA process will be completed within 12-18 months after submission. 
 
Internationally, we intend on submitting our EXPRESS devices and cassettes to the WHO procurement listing process which requires a full regulatory and quality documentation dossier, produced and compiled by us. WHO process requires laboratory testing and evaluation and then may require clinical trials for public deployment and documentation throughout the whole process.

Once the WHO process is complete and documented, there is a submission into the Global Fund, which is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and people affected by infectious diseases specifically HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis, and malaria.
 
The Global Fund raises and invests nearly $4 billion a year to support programs run by local experts in countries that are most in need.
 
We intend to submit selected cassettes and EXPRESS RTDs to the FDA, WHO and the Global Fund for regulatory review.
 
Currently, both our cassette malaria pF and malaria pF/pV have been listed under the WHO procurement process. 
 
Regulatory considerations for the NuGenerex Family of Companies
 
Our business is subject to highly complex United States federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plans and initiatives. We are required to obtain and hold licenses and permits and to comply with the regulatory requirements of various governmental agencies. If we fail to comply with such regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply with such regulations, the economic viability of our Company may be adversely affected. 
 FDA Regulations
 
The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of, or license to commercialize medical devices (such as Orthopedic Implants), biologics, and drugs. This includes compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections, and recalls and other matters. As a distributor, marketer, and now, an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements that apply to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with those applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as fines, civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions. To support our biologics product lines, we are a registered establishment with the FDA for the storage and distribution of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps).
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
We are required to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Such healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to the relationships that we and our distributors have with healthcare professionals and entities, such as physicians and hospitals. U.S. federal health care laws including laws related to false claims, health care fraud and abuse, physician self-referrals, and anti-kickbacks apply when we or are customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded health care programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid). In comparable fashion, state health care laws of a similar nature apply to state-funded health care programs and may also apply with private third-party payors. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, substantial fines, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect the economic viability of our Company.

28
--

 

We instituted a company-wide compliance program for all employees, vendors, and contractors. During 2018, we hired a compliance officer who is responsible for developing compliance programs, reviewing our policies, overseeing adherence to those policies, and advising management on possible risks. Our policies related to this realm include general ethical business practices as well as specific operating policies and training to ensure compliance with relevant and applicable healthcare laws and regulations that include the laws referenced above in addition to other applicable laws, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
 
NuGenerex Distribution Solutions and MSO Regulatory Considerations
 
NuGenerex Distribution Solutions operates under strict federal and state guidelines across several of the product and service lines offered by us. In particular, the NuGenerex MSO is regulated at the state level, where the physician-owned management services organization (MSO) has been deemed by our healthcare attorneys to be legally compliant in 27 states. The NuGenerex MSO operates in compliance with all laws and regulations as detailed below:
 
We believe that the following statements support an assertion that our ownership structure and the proposed arrangement as a whole is structured to comply with some of the recommendations set forth by the OIG in the Bulletin, the Special Fraud Alert and other guidance:
 

• | Each investor will have made a financial investment in a bona fide business venture organized for the primary purpose of performing certain contracted services for the benefit of a Contracted Ancillary Provider; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | If an investor receives any distributions, such distributions will be made solely on the basis of such investor’s proportionate ownership of the Company, and not on the basis of referrals by any individual or class of investors or the revenues generated by referrals from such investor; 
• | Subscriptions for ownership of the Company will not be accepted or rejected on the basis of expected volume of referrals or amount of business otherwise generated for the Company or indirectly a Contracted Ancillary Provider by the subscriber; and 
• | There is no requirement that an investor make referrals to, or otherwise generate business for, a Contracted Ancillary Provider, NuGenerex or the Company as a condition of participation in the Company. 

 
Some of the most applicable health care related laws, rules, and regulations to the company are, including but not limited to, the following:
 
Stark Laws
 
The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and direct and indirect compensation arrangements. We do not believe that the Stark Law will be applicable to us or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral to a Contracted Ancillary Provider (as hereinafter defined) for the furnishing of any ancillary healthcare services for which payment may be made under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.
 
We do not believe the Subcontracted Services Agreement creates a direct financial relationship between the Physician Members (or their professional organizations) and a Contracted Ancillary Provider because (i) the Vendor Services Agreement is between NuGenerex on the one hand, and a Contracted Ancillary Provider on the other and (ii) the Subcontracted Services Agreement is between us on the one hand and NuGenerex on the other. Further, we believe that the Subcontracted Services Agreement, as structured, complies with the Stark Law exception for personal services should any enforcement authorities or agencies take the position that the Physician Members have a direct financial relationship with a Contracted Ancillary Provider. Further, we believe the arrangements meet the Stark Law exception for personal services.
 

29

The Anti-Kickback Statue
 
The federal anti-kickback statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in exchange for, referrals of business reimbursed under federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
 
We do not believe that the Anti-Kickback Statute will be applicable to us or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral of business to a Contracted Ancillary Provider reimbursed under any federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act is a civil statute used as a primary tool for recovering monies from health care entities who have committed fraud against the federal government.
 
We do not intend to receive any compensation that is related to the referral of patients covered by any federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid. We also plan to take precautions to avoid any activity that could be considered civil or criminal false claims.
 
Civil Monetary Penalty Statute
 
The Civil Monetary Penalty Statute prohibits a health care provider from knowingly making a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit services to Medicare or Medicaid patients under the physician’s direct care. We do not believe that the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute will be applicable to us or any Physician Member because neither we nor any Physician Member intends to make any referral of business to a Contracted Ancillary Provider reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs.
NuGenerex Distribution Solutions Other Regulatory Considerations
 
Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act
 
The Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act prohibits anyone from intentionally or knowingly offering to pay or agreeing to accept any remuneration (directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, or in cash or in kind) to or from anyone else for securing or soliciting patients for or from a person licensed, certified or registered by a Texas healthcare regulatory agency. Unlike the Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute, which only apply to payments by federal government programs, the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act applies to all payers, including private insurance companies. As a means of balancing this broad application, however, the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act provides that compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes compliance with the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act.
 
Because the Texas statute provides that compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes compliance with the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act, the analysis of the Company under the Texas Patient Non-Solicitation Act is essentially the same as the analysis under the Anti-Kickback Statute.
 
Texas Fee Splitting
 
The Texas Medical Practice Act prohibits fee-splitting and other unethical conduct. Any physician who is found to have violated the Texas Medical Practice Act may be subject to criminal sanctions or loss of such physician’s license to practice medicine. Prospective physician investors are advised to consult their personal counsel regarding the potential impact of this statute on their individual circumstances.
 Texas Commercial Bribery Statute
 
The Texas Commercial Bribery Statute makes it a criminal violation for anyone, including a physician, acting without the consent of their patient, to accept any benefit from another person or entity to influence such physician’s conduct toward the patient. A violation of the commercial bribery law could result in a physician’s loss of license to practice medicine in Texas.

30
--

 
The risk of violation of both the commercial bribery and the non-solicitation of patient’s statutes will be significantly reduced if the patient of a Physician Member, prior to receiving services from a Contracted Ancillary Provider, is informed of the Physician Member’s ownership in the Company and its indirect financial relationship with a Contracted Ancillary Provider.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Generex Historical Business Marketing & Distribution
 
Historically, we had marketing agreements with international distribution companies for distribution of Oral-Lyn in approved territories. Those agreements are no longer in effect.
 
Currently, as clinical stage development companies, neither NGIO nor NuGenerex Therapeutics (Oral-Lyn and RapidMist buccal delivery system) markets or distributes any products.
 
NGDx Marketing & Distribution
 
Sales of the NuGenerex Diagnostics EXPRESS line of diagnostic kits for infectious diseases is dependent on regulatory approvals issued by such agencies as the WHO, FDA and registration with the Global Fund. These approvals are a key element in the sales and marketing effort on an international basis. We will work with these organizations as well as governmental agencies in target countries and commercial companies.
 
WHO-Listed 
 
Following the successful fulfillment of previous Partnership for Supply Chain Management (“PFSCM”) and WHO shipments, NGDx continues to participate in requests for proposals from PFSCM for our currently WHO-approved NGDx Malaria test. All of the NGDx Malaria RDT’s are on the WHO procurement list.
 
We will also participate in the newly designed and recently announced WHO Pre-Qualification Program for Malaria RDTs. We intend to present the new Malaria EXPRESS II devices for Pf, Pf/Pv and Pf/Pan for this Pre-Qualification Program. 
 
NGDx EXPRESS II - Syphilis
 
In January 2019, NGDx received CE Marking Certification for its rapid point-of-care Express II Syphilis Treponemal Assay from the European Union. We are currently seeking development and distribution partners in international markets for the NGDx product portfolio as we plan for U.S. clinical development of our Express II rapid diagnostic technology for infectious diseases and sepsis.


Olaregen Marketing & Distribution
 
Olaregen has established a team of internal sales and marketing professionals who oversee the marketing, sales & distribution for Excellagen. Currently the product may be sold immediately in the United States. Olaregen plans to focus its efforts on selling to specialized ambulatory wound care centers, surgeons, dermatologists, and in phase II nursing homes. In these institutions the reimbursement rates are nearly double those at hospitals for the same medical procedures. This is an important market since approximately ~80-90% of patients that qualify for using Excellagen are treated in these health care centers. Excellagen can be used for nearly all wound indications but management plans to focus on those that are treated outside of a hospital setting including Diabetic, Venous and Arterial ulcers initially as well as Post Moth’s surgery, Operating Rooms (“OR”) and Ambulatory Care Surgeries with all these indications being extremely prevalent, most significantly amongst the elderly.
 
In September 2019, Olaregen entered into a national sales and distribution agreement with AvKare Inc. to become the sales and distribution partner for Excellagen’s Wound Conforming Matrix in all Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals along with other government medical facilities throughout the United States. AvKare is one of the largest SDVOSB distributors in the U.S. with a direct selling organization calling on more than 170 VA hospitals as well as Department of Defense healthcare facilities. Under the agreement, AvKare will continue to distribute Excellagen to the VA in 0.5 ml, 0.8 ml, and 3.0 ml size.

Olaregen is signing intra-company agreements with partner companies in the NuGenerex family of companies for distribution of Excellagen through both our proprietary market channels, and through our national distribution footprint.
 
Manufacturing
 
Generex Historical Business
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology Manufacturing
 NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology manufactures AE37 immunotherapeutic vaccine, a nineteen amino-acid peptide referred to as AE37 (Ii-Key/HER2 776-790 hybrid) under contract with PolyPeptide Laboratories, San Diego, CA. The suspended substance (lypophilized peptide suspended in sterile, normal saline) is formulated into 2 mL glass vials containing 500 micrograms of peptide in 0.5 mL of 0.45% saline. All manufacturing of AE37 is conducted under FDA cGMP compliance.
 
We have produced, packaged and shipped AE37 for the upcoming clinical trial of AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Merck’s Keytruda) for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer.
 
The Company will require additional manufacturing for future trials with AE37 or any other Ii-Key hybrid immunotherapeutic peptide for the treatment of cancer, and plans to use PolyPeptide Laboratories for future production work. In the event that PolyPeptide Laboratories is unable to meet the manufacturing requirements of NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, there are multiple contract manufacturers that can provide cGMP peptide synthesis, purification, and packaging services.
 
NGDx Manufacturing
 
NGDx manufactures its RTD devices in our Miramar, Florida facility. Based on order size, delivery requirements and current orders in process, the Miramar facility can manufacture up to 1 million RTD devices, all of which are currently hand assembled. We have long-standing relationships with subcontractors to handle additional production requirements.  
 
Cassette production is conducted through subcontractors in India and China. Each site operates under cGMP as well as being compliant with ISO 9001 and ISO13485. All NGDx cassettes are included in our U.S. Certificate of Exportability and European Union CE Mark registrations. All of our cassette malaria tests are approved by the WHO.
 
We have established Quality and Assembly Agreements, as well as confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors. All are subject to our inspection at a moment’s notice.
 
The quality of final assembly of each of our products is maintained under the strict guidelines of our internal Quality System, which forms the basis for our ISO13485 rating. 
 
Full quality oversight is mandatory and final batch release testing is conducted on each lot of products assembled prior to shipment release. 
 
With full automation, we anticipate producing up to 10 million EXPRESS devices annually. Expanded production would allow for additional expansion beyond this volume. Additionally, we anticipate that subcontractors would provide approximately 60 million cassette tests per year. 
 
Olaregen Manufacturing
 
Olaregen contracts with a third party specialty manufacturer in the United Kingdom to manufacture Excellagen. Excellagen is an aseptically manufactured, flowable dermal matrix consisting of a stabilized formulation of renatured atelopeptide bovine fibrillar tropocollagen supplied in prefilled, ready to use syringes. Excellagen is manufactured according to cGMP and requires controlled temperature storage (2-8°C) to maintain structural integrity and bioactivity.

32
--

 

During manufacture, the collagen component of Excellagen is purified using a specialized, validated aseptic process that effectively inactivates potential contaminating viruses, eliminates impurities, and removes denatured molecules and collagen fragments. Excellagen consists almost exclusively of high molecular weight, intact, fibrillar collagen and is formulated at a concentration of 2.6% (26 mg/mL) in a physiologic buffer with protein stabilizing agents.
 
Regentys Manufacturing
 
Regentys has contracted with Cook Biotech Incorporated (“CBI”), West Layette, IN on the development and manufacture of the Regentys ECMH™ (Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel) Rectal Solution, an extracellular matrix hydrogel derived from small intestinal submucosa (SIS) of pigs. All manufacturing is conducted according to FDA cGMP standards.
Pantheon Medical Manufacturing
 
Pantheon manufactures foot & ankle surgical kits, including plates and screws under contract with a third-party contract manufacturer. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance (“510(k) Approval”) to the Pantheon plates and screws, authorizing Pantheon to commercially distribute the foot & ankle surgical kit. The 510(k) Approval process, also known as pre-market notification, requires demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally U.S. marketed medical device. Once a device receives a 510(k) Approval, maintaining that status is based on compliance with annual requirements set by the FDA. All manufacturing is conducted under FDA GMP compliance.
Raw Material Supplies
 
Generex Historical Business Raw Materials
 
The excipients used in our formulation are available from numerous sources in sufficient quantities for clinical purposes, and we believe that they will be available in sufficient quantities for commercial purposes when required, although we have not yet attempted to secure a guaranteed commercial supply of any such products. Components suitable for our RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler are available from a limited number of potential suppliers, as is the chemical propellant used in the device. The components which now comprise the device are expected to be used in the commercial version of our insulin product in countries where the product has been approved. We do not currently have supply arrangements for commercial quantities with manufacturers for the components and the propellant that we presently use in our RapidMist™ brand metered dose. Reputable and reliable suppliers for these components exist and we believe that we can enter into arrangements for commercial supply with these suppliers when we are ready to commence commercial production.
 
Insulin is available worldwide from multiple sources. We do not currently have any agreements for the long-term supply of insulin, but we expect that we will be readily able to negotiate such an agreement before further clinical trials or commercial sales commence.
 
AE37 and other Ii-Key hybrid immunotherapeutic peptides are produced via standard peptide synthesis and purification methods requiring readily available amino acids and standard chemicals.
 
NGDx Diagnostics Raw Materials
 
A number of our components and critical raw materials are provided by third-party suppliers. Some of our supplies, including antigens and antibodies, may be available from only one or a limited number of sources. This may impact our ability to manufacture or sell product if our suppliers cannot or will not deliver those materials in a timely fashion, or at all, due to an interruption in their supply, quality or technical issues, or any other reason. The absence of any one or more of these supplies could prevent us from being able to commercially produce and market the affected product or products.

Olaregen Raw Materials
 Excellagen collagen is derived from bovine hides that are sourced from animals continuously reared and slaughtered in Australia, a country recognized by the World Organization for Animal Health as having a negligible BSE risk. The cattle are declared fit for human consumption by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and the starting material is EDQM certified. As of 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes skin as a “lower-infectivity tissue” (Category IB). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also known as mad cow disease) has never been detected in cattle in Australia. Each lot of Excellagen undergoes rigorous release testing according to validated test methods and product specifications, including sterility. 
Regentys Raw Materials
 Extracellular matrix hydrogel is derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa which is primarily Types I, III, IV and VI collagen. The natural composition of SIS also includes fibronectin and laminin. The general function of these extracellular matrix (ECM) components are well-established. Porcine intestines are sourced from domestic animals in compliance with ISO 22442. 
Intellectual Property
 
Generex Historical Business
 
Oral-Lyn & RapidMist
 
We hold a number of patents in the United States and foreign countries covering our buccal and other delivery technologies. We also have developed brand names and trademarks for products in appropriate areas. We consider the overall protection of our patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement. Our patent
 
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceutical products. Protection for individual products or technologies extends for varying periods, in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
 
We currently have three issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application pertaining to various aspects of drug delivery technology, including oral administration of macromolecular formulations (such as insulin). We also currently hold international patents covering our drug delivery technology in jurisdictions other than the U.S., including Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Israel, Australia and Europe. The expiration dates of the U.S. issued patents range from 2020 to 2022, and the international patents are enforceable to 2028. We plan to submit new patent applications for the reformulated Oral-Lyn II for Type II diabetes upon funding.
 
We possess the worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights to our oral insulin product.

NGIO Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
Platform Patents
 The foundational “Platform Patents” for Ii-Key technology focus on methods of increasing the antigen-specific activation of CD4+ T cells. This cell type is a critical component of the immune system, involved both in the recognition of new pathogenic agents as well as in autoimmune syndromes. The first technology platform (Ii-Key hybrid) relates to a means for increasing the vaccine potency of virtually any protein and while the second (Ii-suppression) relates to generation of an effective cell-based vaccine (REH-2017-01, REH-2017-02).
Oncology Patents
 This group of patents relate more specifically to the use of the platform technologies for generating anti-cancer vaccines. We have generated Ii-Key hybrid compounds specifically for patients with breast, prostate, bladder, melanoma and HPV-related cancers (AEX-2001, AEX-2006, AEX-2007).
 
We hold five U.S. patents and one patent in Japan. The U.S. patent numbers are 7,935,350 (expiring on November 3, 2022), 8,748,130 (expiring on December 10, 2025), 8889143 (expiring on May 18, 2026), 928945 (expiring on September 22, 2027), 8,815,249 (expiring on February 26, 2026). The Japan patent number is 5707326 (expiring on September 1, 2029). These patents cover:
 

• | Compositions and Methods Related to Ii Technology 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Ii hybrid peptides used for the enhancement of antigen presentation 
• | Constructs for the expression of Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides 
• | Hybrid Ii-Key/antigen epitope fusion peptides 
• | Methods for inhibiting Ii expression 

 
We also have U.S. patents on the Ii-Key technology have expired, we are in discussions with third parties to extend the patent coverage of the Ii-Key technology for cancer immunotherapy. The expiration dates of the immune-oncology applications of the Ii-Key hybrid technologies extend to 2031. The company is exploring the development of new immunotherapeutic peptide vaccines against additional tumor antigens, and plans to use computer algorithms to identify epitopes of tumor antigens that can be linked to the Ii-Key to develop new IP and products based on the Ii-Key platform technology.
 
Our long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators. 
 
NGDx Intellectual Property
 
NGDx holds a U.S. Patent for its sample delivery system which expires in 2026, US Patent # 7,749,771, titled “Device and methods for detecting analyte in a sample.”  This is the basis for our EXPRESS system platform.

35
--

 

In June, 2018, we filed for patent protection for the Express II format with the US Patent and Trade Mark Office.
 
We believe NGDx’s long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any future patents will be granted, or that any patents which we now own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of medical device companies in general, are uncertain and con include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.
 Olaregen Intellectual Property
 Olaregen has the exclusive license to Excellagen in all regions of the world except Russia, China, and the CIS countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan).
 
The U.S. patent on Excellagen has been issued as of October 10, 2017 and now has 17 years of additional exclusivity.
 
Regentys Intellectual Property
 
Regentys has licensed the exclusive, world-wide intellectual property rights for Regentys ECMH from the University of Pittsburgh in exchange for future royalties. The intellectual property subject to the license is entitled “Extracellular Matrix Derived Gels” and “Methods for Preparation of A Terminally Sterilized Hydrogel Derived From Extracellular Matrix” developed by Stephen Badylak et.al. of University faculty.
 
Additionally, Regentys and the University of Pittsburgh are co-owners by assignment of certain intellectual property rights pertaining to “Method and Composition for Treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease Without Colectomy” developed by Stephen Badylak and Timothy Keane of University and by Marc Ramer of the Regentys.
 
We continue to develop intellectual property for our current and future products. 
 NuGenerex Surgical Supply Subsidiaries Intellectual Property
 We pursue strategic alliances and partnerships through intellectual property license agreements, and secure key purchase agreements from suppliers to build upon our portfolio of IP.
 
We also maintain stocking distribution agreements, which provide exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas and use of associated trademarks, service marks, and tradenames for the sale and promotion of the products we offer, which generally have durations of one (1) to three (3) years, subject to renewal terms. Furthermore, we require leased employees, independent contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute agreements, with varying terms of one to three years, which assign to us the IP existing and generated from their work. We believe our IP and exclusive distribution agreements provide us with important competitive advantages by (i) increasing our brand awareness and the brand awareness of the products we distribute; and (ii) ensuring that we use the latest design and manufacturing technology for our products that are perceived to be important to our customers.

Seasonality
 
Our products and services are not subject to seasonality.
 
Competition
 
Generex Historical Business Competition
 
We expect that products based upon our buccal delivery technology and any other products that we may develop will compete directly with products developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government agencies and public and private research organizations.
 
Products developed by our competitors may use a different active pharmaceutical agent or treatment to treat the same medical condition or indication as our product or may provide for the delivery of substantially the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products using different methods of administration. For example, a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in various stages of research, development and testing of alternatives to insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes, as well as new methods of delivering insulin. These methods, including nasal, transdermal, needle-free (high pressure) injection and pulmonary, may ultimately successfully deliver insulin to diabetic patients. Some biotechnology companies also have developed different technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific research and product development capabilities, as well as financial, marketing and human resources, than we do.
 
Where the same or substantially the same active ingredient is available using alternative delivery means or the same or substantially the same result is achievable with a different treatment or technology, we expect that competition among products will be based, among other things, on product safety, efficacy, ease of use, availability, price, marketing and distribution. When different active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved, these same competitive factors will apply to both the active agent and the delivery method.
 
We consider other drug delivery and biotechnology companies to be direct competitors for the cooperation and support of major drug and biotechnology companies that own or market proprietary pharmaceutical compounds and technologies, as well as for the ultimate patient market. Of primary concern to us are the competitor companies that are known to be developing delivery systems for insulin and other pharmaceutical agents that we have identified as product candidates and technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Inc., MedImmune Inc. (a subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca, Inc.) and others, also compete in the oncology, immunomedicine, and vaccine markets. These companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products. As such, they are also considered significant competitors in these fields of pharmaceutical products and therapies. There are also many smaller companies which are pursuing similar technologies in these fields and are considered to be our competitors.
 
There are also a number of companies developing alternative means of delivering insulin in the form of oral pills, transdermal patches, and intranasal methods, which are at early stages of development. In addition to other delivery systems for insulin, there are numerous products, such as sulfonylureas (Amaryl®and Glynase®), biguanides (branded and generic metformin products), thiazolidinediones (Avandia®and Actos®), glucagon-like peptide 1 (Byetta®and Victoza®), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (Januvia® and Onglyza™), which have been approved for use in the treatment of Type 2 diabetics in substitution of, or in addition to, insulin therapy. These products may also be considered to compete with insulin products.

In addition, there are a number of companies that are pursuing cancer treatments using immunotherapy technologies which have products in various clinical trial stages.  Some of these companies are Argos Therapeutics Inc., Celldex Therapeutics Inc., Northwest Therapeutics Inc., Immatics Biotechnology GmbH, Immunocellular Therapeutics Ltd., TVAX Biomedical Inc., and Newlink Genetics Corporation. These companies can also be considered to be competitors. 
 
NGDx Competition
 
The diagnostics industry is a multi-billion dollar international industry and is intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources. Industry competition in general is based on the following:
 

• | Scientific and technological capability; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Proprietary know-how and intellectual protection; 
• | The ability to develop and market products and processes; 
• | The ability to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearances; 
• | The ability to manufacture products that meet applicable governmental and NGO requirements; 
• | The ability to manufacture products cost-effectively; 
• | Access to adequate capital; and 
• | The ability to find and retain qualified personnel. 

 
We believe our scientific and technological capabilities, as well as our proprietary technology and know-how relating to our rapid tests, particularly for the development and manufacture of tests for the detection of antibodies to infectious diseases are, indeed, very strong and will allow us to compete in this market. 
 
Main Competitors
 
In the diagnostic space, Alere Inc., which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017, is our main competitor and one of the major players in RTDs for infectious diseases. Standard Diagnostics is a strong competitor on an international basis, incorporating a cassette design into each of their products. Our competitors also include Chembio Diagnostic Systems Inc., a publicly traded diagnostic company that develops, manufactures and commercializes diagnostic solutions. There are a number of point-of-care strip manufacturers in China that serve the market in that country. As of yet, most of these companies have not made a significant impact on the overall global market but could be considered as a future source of competition. As infectious diseases are epidemic and in the minds of the public, there will be more competitors coming into the market place. However, competition will be based upon the implementation of a cassette or a “dipstick” format. 
Competitive Advantage

We believe our unique and simple EXPRESS product design delivers significant advantages over our competition. 
 
Due to the potential infectious character of the whole blood test sample, our EXPRESS series of RDTs are designed to perform and deliver test results while sealed within the EXPRESS housing, carefully controlling the potentially infectious test sample. This design helps to increase our ability to control the possibility of cross-contamination. Most of our competitors’ products, while inexpensive, are not as user-friendly, require substantially more training, and have greater risk of cross- contamination. And, the simplicity of use of our EXPRESS platforms fits directly into the necessities of World Health Organization Rapid Disease Testing Algorithms and individual country disease reduction goals and priorities.

Our products are more intuitive and self-explanatory than our competitors’, making it easier and safer to use. Our products require less training and education. Each EXPRESS is configured to operate in the same way regardless of the type of disease being tested.
 
With ease of use, simple design, and faster results, our products allow for more tests administered at the patient point of care level.
 
We will compete on the basis of these advantages. Most of our competitors’ products, while inexpensive, are not as user-friendly, require substantially more training, and have greater risk of cross- contamination.
 
NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology Competition
 
The cancer immunotherapy space is crowded as the scientific mechanisms of cancer and immunity become better understood. According to the Cancer Research Institute, there are 3,394 immuno-oncology therapies in the current global development pipeline, with 1,287 of them in clinical studies. The major pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Sanofi, and Pfizer, among others have significant research and development efforts in the immune-oncology field.
 
Neon Therapeutics is a leading immune-oncology biotechnology company. TapImmune and Marker Therapeutics recently merged to advance innovative neoantigen and immunotherapy products.
 
NuGenerex Surgical Products Competition
 
As a national distributor, we primarily compete with other distributors, as well as large, vertically-integrated medical device manufacturers that enjoy well-established distribution channels, national sales networks, direct sales models, and participation in large group purchasing organizations contracted with major hospitals and surgery centers.
 
We believe that our status as the manufacturer and distributor of FDA-approved Maxim X-Treme System, sets us apart from other distributors and gives us a competitive advantage against distributors who are not able to manufacture their own products.
 
Generally, we view Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew, and Orthofix International, N.V., as examples of our vertically-integrated competitors. We believe those competitors, and companies like them, only distribute products they manufacture and have significant costs related to research and development and organizational support. Conversely, we sell a broad portfolio of specialized third-party manufacturers’ products and have no costs related to research and development for such third-party products, nor do we have similar costs for organizational support since we are not vertically-integrated. Thus, we believe our competitive advantage lies primarily with our single-source fulfillment sales model, allowing us to offer a broader assortment of several manufacturers’ products. Furthermore, as a manufacturer for some medical devices, we do not have significant costs associated with research and development or organizational support. Thus, we generally see immediate increases in revenues because of the increased gross margins afforded by the lower costs associated with being a manufacturer. Accordingly, the compensation packages we offer to our employed sales team have higher-earning potentials than the compensation packages our competitors offer, allowing us to attract and retain talented and experienced employees.
 
We contract primarily with small- and medium-sized manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. These manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures. Because of our organizational structure, large distribution footprint, and our sales model, we tend to align well with our specialized suppliers’ competitive strategies, which we believe results in more partnerships with such suppliers than our competitors, because we can purchase large quantities of their product as a wholesale customer.

We believe the competition in our industry is primarily caused by continued mergers and acquisitions of smaller distributors by larger, vertically-integrated companies that produce, market and distribute medical devices, Orthopedic Implants, and Biologics. Our vertically-integrated competitors benefit from their ability to control costs for the devices they manufacture and distribute. Moreover, the market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government reimbursements and, to a lesser degree, competitive discount pricing. We believe that our industry will continue to see increased mergers and acquisitions because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device distributors and specialized suppliers offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States. 
 
Environmental Compliance
 
Our research and development activities have involved the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for damages, and these damages could severely impact our financial condition. We are also subject to many environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, particularly those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of hazardous biological materials. Violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us. However, we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
NGDx Research & Development Expenditures

(“NSABP”) under which NSABP will conduct clinical research using the Company’s AE37 peptide immunotherapeutic vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab (Ketruda®) for the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The Company has agreed to pay NSABP an amount not to exceed $2,118,461 based on NSABP achieving various milestones. The Company recognized $272,063 and $340,000 as research and development related to the clinical trial agreement with NSABP in the years ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
We will continue to require substantial funds to continue research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, further clinical trials for AE37 and to commence sales and marketing efforts if the FDA or other regulatory approvals are obtained. Currently, the Phase II clinical study using AE37 in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda ®) for treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer is our only ongoing research and development project.
Employees
 
The Generex management team has been working without contracts or employment agreements since taking over the Company in January 2017. Upon financing, we expect to engage the management team as employees with terms to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Generex Board of Directors. In fiscal year 2020, the compensation committee approved salaries for some officers and board members.
