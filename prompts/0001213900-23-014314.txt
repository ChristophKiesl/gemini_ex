Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination.



While our efforts to identify a target business may span many industries and regions worldwide, we have primarily focused our search for prospects within the clean/renewable energy (“energy transition”) space.



We intend to complete an initial business combination with a business that is actively engaged in creating and deploying technology, services, or other offerings that contribute to energy transition in the power generation, industrial, transportation, or other industries. We may also seek a target in disruptive technology industries more broadly, but which still falls within our target of de-carbonization space. However, we are not limited to these industries and we may pursue a business combination opportunity with any business or in any industry we choose.



We believe we are well positioned to draw upon a vast network across the energy transition and conventional energy sectors to identify opportunities with the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.



We broadly define the energy transition sector to include, but not be limited to:




● | Utility scale solutions to address issues related to the dislocations caused by renewable power generation through either power storage or clean transportation fuel solutions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hydrogen solutions for power storage, generation and transportation; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Software solutions for managing and improving reliability of renewable power generation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Carbon capture and sequestration;
--+----------------------------------


● | Integrated case-specific solutions for reliable renewable power generation supply and storage; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | De-carbonization solutions for oil and gas, conventional power generation, agriculture, chemicals, shipping, mining, cement and other industries; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upstream raw materials supply solutions and downstream mobility solutions for electrification. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Public Offering



On October 25, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 27,600,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $276,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 1,335,000 placement units to our sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $13,350,000.



A total of $281,520,000, comprised of $270,480,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and a portion of the $13,350,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by John Dowd, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Vikas Anand, our Chief Development Officer, who have many years of experience in identifying, investing, growing and operating businesses in diverse sectors, including our targeted ones.





1







We originally had up to 15 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 25, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, up to two times (for a total of up to 21 months, or until July 25, 2023, to complete a business combination); provided that our sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) must deposit into the trust account additional funds of $2,760,000 (or $0.10 per share) for each of the available three-month extensions, for a total payment of up to $5,520,000 (or $0.20 per share), in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Our public shareholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination from 15 months to up to 21 months described above or to redeem their shares in connection with such extension.



On January 18, 2023, our sponsor requested that we extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the Extension, on January 19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of $2,760,000 to our sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, our sponsor deposited the Extension Payment of $2,760,000 (representing $0.10 per public share) into the trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the Extension. The Extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents, as described above.



We must complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.

Market Opportunity



Concerns regarding climate change are rapidly changing the global energy sector.



While efforts to infuse clean and renewable sources into a fossil fuel-dominated world have been ongoing for decades, progress was stymied by clean energy’s lower returns, higher costs and over-reliance on government subsidies and regulation. For years, wind and solar projects were considered too expensive relative to coal and natural gas options.



Over the past decade, however, the cost of wind and solar power has dropped to a competitive level, technologies have advanced and heightened environmental concerns are highlighting clean energy benefits and driving new regulations and worldwide decarbonization plans. Since 2010, the cost of energy has dropped by 82% for photovoltaic solar, by 47% for concentrated solar energy, by 39% for onshore wind and by 29% for wind offshore according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.





7







As a result, we have seen an acceleration in the energy transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels and toward a widespread acceptance of cleaner, more reliable energy systems. In 2019, U.S. annual energy consumption from renewable sources exceeded coal consumption for the first time since before 1885 and electricity generated from renewable sources represented almost three quarters of new power capacity added in 2019. We believe that we are leaving behind the 20th century of fossil fuels to become the 21st century of clean electrification, where decarbonization of industrial sectors such as mining and manufacturing represent a massive untapped opportunity.



This energy transition is likely to continue for decades, providing the potential to alter global economies and geopolitics, employ millions, and improve lives, as electricity becomes more reliable and accessible around the world. Most recent supply chain disruptions have created new opportunity set to de-bottleneck electrification supply chain.



Because it is in its infancy, the energy transition industry is currently a highly fragmented and rapidly evolving segment that stands to benefit from exponential disruptive growth in the coming years. Today, hundreds of private companies in the energy transition sector are being aided by a confluence of positively changing marketplace dynamics, emerging clean technological solutions, social and customer demands for clean energy, and increasing government policy support around the world.



Our objective is to facilitate capital access to companies that are contributing to energy transition, understanding that we are in the early stages of this disruption, and must first bridge the gap between traditional and green energy. As a result, we will focus on products, technologies or services sold to utilities, developers or industrial companies, including, but not limited to, technologies for carbon sequestration.



As more intermittent power such as wind or solar are added to the electric grid, erratic electricity prices become more common. Investment in utility-scale power storage solutions, or innovative large-scale battery technology is needed. This is starting to occur. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that, between 2010 and the end of 2018, utility scale battery storage systems increased power capacity by almost 15x and energy capacity by almost 59x. Meanwhile, lithium-ion battery pack prices have fallen 89% in real terms between 2010 and 2020, according to BloombergNEF, facilitating continued capacity expansion. Over the last decade most investments in battery technology were geared towards high power density battery solutions used in mobility. Our team sees new utility scale storage technologies emerging in the near future that will help to solve the problem of grid reliability in a safe way as renewables intermittent generation continues to augment baseload conventional generation.



The quest for carbon neutrality and reduced carbon emissions will remain a global priority for years to come, and breakthrough technologies will be critical to that success. We believe that companies operating in and contributing to this critical energy transition will continue to need and benefit from broader access to public capital markets as that dynamic proceeds.



Business Strategy and Deal Origination



Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a business that can benefit from the strategic, operational and transactional experience of our management team. We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities in industries related to energy transition as well as in broader disruptive technology sectors, which provide an opportunity for transformational growth driven by de-carbonization.



Our acquisition and value creation strategy has been and will continue to be to identify and enter into a business combination with a business in the energy transition sector and, after our initial business combination, enhance the shareholder returns for the post-combination business utilizing the expertise of our management team, board, and executive advisors, many of whom are recognized experts in the energy transition sector. Our business combination strategy will leverage the following attributes of our management team, board, and executive advisors:




● | Broad network, proprietary contacts, corporate relationships (including financing providers and investment market participants, private equity groups, renewables developers, research institutes, think tanks supporting de-carbonization efforts around the world, investment banks, accounting firms, target management teams and companies or individuals that represent sellers) and industry experience of our management team and executive advisors developed through extensive experience in investing, operating, marketing and growing businesses in the energy transition industry; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to enact positive transformation, attractive revenue and relationship growth, operational enhancements and efficiencies to grow shareholder value pre and post business combination closing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






8








● | Augmentation of capabilities surrounding capital allocation, and scaling up target technologies with utility customer base and/or solving issues related to the reliability of the renewable energy sources operations on the utility scale. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our management team, board, and executive advisors have reached out and will continue to reach out to their global networks to articulate our potential business combination target search parameters and commence the pursuit and diligence of prospective leads.



We target businesses both within the U.S. and internationally, which have scalable applications and global ambitions. The experience, maturity and judgment of our management will guide our process.



We will need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to acquire a business with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing.



If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing.



Business Combination Criteria



Our management team and members of the board of directors share a similar, growth-oriented and value-creating investment philosophy. We employ a proactive acquisition strategy focused on companies that have demonstrated a potential for future growth through the deployment of emerging technologies.



We have identified the following criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we have used and will continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the Lifezone Business Combination, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We seek to acquire companies that we believe will have:




● | The potential to have a market capitalization of above $1 billion post the initial business combination closing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive risk-adjusted returns for our warrant holders and shareholders; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sustainable solutions that have a strong environmental, social, governance component and enable carbon emission reduction/de-carbonization; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A business model with positive environmental and social impact, taking into account stakeholders, employees and the community, without sacrificing a financial return for our shareholders; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A company that would benefit from our management team’s operating expertise, technical expertise, structuring expertise, extensive network, insight and capital markets expertise in energy transition; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The capability of taking advantage of paradigm shifts created by growth of renewable generation in power generation mix and resulting power market dislocations through the use of disruptive technologies; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Substantial growth potential post the initial business combination closing; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






9








● | Leading positions and barriers of entry within the targeted industries that exhibit strong fundamentals; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qualifications to be public companies and to benefit from having a public currency in order to enhance their ability to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital projects, and/or strengthen their balance sheet; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability to capitalize on unique or specialized technologies or business platforms; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value that has been discounted or disregarded by the marketplace. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------




While we use these criteria in evaluating business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business or businesses that meets some but not all of these proposed criteria. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. If we do not complete the Lifezone Business Combination and if we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender-offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We will effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.



If we pay for our initial business combination using shares or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other businesses or assets or for working capital.



Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, including LHL, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 



We originally had up to 15 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 25, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months, or until July 25, 2023, to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) depositing into the trust account, on or prior to the applicable deadline, additional funds of $2,760,000, for each of the available three-month extensions, for a total payment of up to $5,520,000. Any such payments would be made in the form of non-interest bearing loans. If we complete our initial business combination, we will, at the option of our sponsor, repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us or convert a portion or all of the total loan amount into units at a price of $10.00 per unit, which units will be identical to the placement units. If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans only from funds held outside of the trust account, if any such funds are available. We currently believe we will not have sufficient funds left outside of the trust account to pay back such loans if our initial business combination is not completed. Our shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. However, our shareholders will be entitled to vote and redeem their shares in connection with a shareholder meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender offer undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination during any three-month extension period.



In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or permitted designees are not obligated to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.





10







On January 18, 2023, our sponsor requested that we extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the Extension, on January 19, 2023, we issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of $2,760,000 to our sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, our sponsor deposited the Extension Payment of $2,760,000 (representing $0.10 per public share) into the trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the Extension. The Extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents as described above.



If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), we will redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect that the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.35 per share as of December 31, 2022 (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) and such amount may be increased by $0.10 per public share for an additional three-month extension of our time to consummate our initial business combination, as described in this Report, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders.



The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time that we sign definitive agreements in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on the NYSE or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or the NYSE, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing.



There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



For more information regarding the shares to be sold in connection with the Lifezone Business Combination, please see “Lifezone Business Combination” above.



Sources of Acquisition Candidates



Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds, brokers and other members of the financial community and corporate executives. These target candidates may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. We have expected and continue to expect such sources to become aware that we are seeking a business combination candidate by a variety of means, including publicly available information relating to our initial public offering, public relations and marketing efforts or direct contact by management following the completion of our initial public offering.



Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their contacts. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only if our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will we pay our sponsor, officers, directors, or executive advisors or any entities with which they are affiliated, any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is); our officers, directors and executive advisors will have an economic interest in securities held by our sponsor. However, the following payments are made to our sponsor, officers, directors, executive advisors, or our or their affiliates: (i) repayment of loans that our sponsor, members of our management team, executive advisors or any of their respective affiliates or other third parties may make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided that if we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment), (ii) payments to our sponsor or its affiliate of a total of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services, and (iii) reimbursements for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigation and completing an initial business combination. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.





11







We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates. Additionally, we are not prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with such persons in the pursuit of an initial business combination. While LHL is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Lifezone Business Combination and we seek to complete an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or we partner with such persons in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. Generally, such opinion is rendered to a company’s board of directors and investment banking firms may take the view that shareholders may not rely on the opinion. Such view will not impact our decision on which investment banking firm to hire.



Unless we consummate our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain a financial fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm. If we do not obtain such an opinion, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value and fairness based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. The application of such standards would involve a comparison, from a valuation standpoint, of our business combination target to comparable public companies, as applicable, and a comparison of our contemplated transaction with such business combination target to other then-recently announced comparable private and public company transactions, as applicable. The application of such standards and the basis of our board of directors’ determination will be discussed and disclosed in our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.



Other Acquisition Considerations



Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or placement units, and, accordingly, have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors will have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.



In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts of interest, our board of directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.



Initial Business Combination



The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.





12







We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of LHL was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



Status as a Public Company



We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as LHL. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See “Lifezone Business Combination” above for more information about such share exchange in the Lifezone Business Combination. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.



Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Lifezone Business Combination, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.



While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may have a negative view of us since we are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain shareholder approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account in connection therewith.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or October 25, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c)  in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year.

Financial Position



With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $285,650,505 as of December 31, 2022 before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business such as a LHL a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.



See “Lifezone Business Combination” above for more information on the financing in the Lifezone Business Combination.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial public combination. We will effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the placement units, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may, although we do not currently intend to, seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans or excess leverage, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other businesses or assets or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.



In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



For more information regarding the financing of the Lifezone Business Combination and the related agreements, please see “Lifezone Business Combination” above.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination



The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. Our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.



If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.





14







In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.



To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, such as LHL, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.



Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.



Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of LHL, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Lifezone Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Michael Sedoy, CFO of GoGreen Investments Corp will become Interim CFO of LifeZone Metals. John Dowd, CEO and Govind Friedland, COO of GoGreen Investments Corp will join LifeZone Metals Board. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including the Lifezone Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination.



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule (as is the case in the Lifezone Business Combination), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.



Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




See “Lifezone Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Lifezone Business Combination.



Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



In the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.



In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.



The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) reduce the number of public shares outstanding or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.





16







Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any public shares purchased by our sponsor or our directors, officers or advisors, or their respective affiliates in privately negotiated transactions will not (i) be purchased at a price higher than the price offered through the redemption process, (ii) be voted in favor of the initial business combination or (iii) have redemption rights, and if such public shares do have redemption rights then such rights will be waived by our sponsor or our directors, officers or advisors, or their respective affiliates.



Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination, such as the Lifezone Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.35 per share (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) and such amount may be increased by $0.10 per share if we extend the time we have to consummate our initial business combination by an additional three months, as described in this Report. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination, including the Lifezone Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination (as is the case in the Lifezone Business Combination) or (ii) if the Lifezone Business Combination is not consummated, by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under the NYSE rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules.



If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






17








● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.



If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+---------------------------------------




We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.



In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own approximately 22.98% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.



See “Lifezone Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Lifezone Business Combination.

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below). We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering (“Excess Shares”) could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares held by them redeemed in connection with (i) our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial holder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in our initial public offering or thereafter through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.



See “Lifezone Business Combination” above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Lifezone Business Combination.



Tendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights



We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.





19







The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the general meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If the Lifezone Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report).



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have until April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete the Lifezone Business Combination or another initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report).



Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report). However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report).



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (ii) with respect to the other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares.





20







If we do not consummate our initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and rested memorandum and articles of association, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $18,810 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.35 as of December 31, 2022 (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.35 (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment). While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we will seek to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.35 per public share as of December 31, 2022 (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.35 per public share (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.35 per share (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment).





21







We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. As of December 31, 2022, the amount held outside of the trust account was $18,810.



If we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.35 per share (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy insolvency court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we fully extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.



Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






22








● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination in accordance with the terms described in this Report), then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. 



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as LHL, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Conflicts of Interest



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.
Indemnity



Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.35 per public share (excluding $.10 per share as a result of the extension payment) or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.





23







Employees



We currently have six officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management team devotes in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Our units, Class A ordinary shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.



We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or October 25, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of GoGreen Investments Corporation



Opinion on the Financial Statements



We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of GoGreen Investments Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period from March 17, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period from March 17, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America.
Emphasis of a Matter Regarding Going Concern



The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the close of business on April 25, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. This date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Basis for Opinion



These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.



We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.



Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.

GOGREEN INVESTMENTS CORPORATION 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations



GoGreen Investments Corporation (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 17, 2021, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).


Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends to focus its search on companies in the clean/renewable energy space. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.


All activity through October 25, 2021, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below. Since the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s activities have been limited to the evaluation of Business Combination candidates, and the Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. On December 13, 2022, The Company and Lifezone Metals Limited (“Lifezone Metals”), an entity incorporated in the Isle of Man entered into a business combination agreement (“Lifezone Business Combination Agreement”). Since entering into the Lifezone Business Combination Agreement the Company’s activities will be limited to completing the Business Combination (as described in Note 10).


The registration statement of the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on October 20, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $276,000,000, which is discussed in Note 3.


Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 1,335,000 units (each, a “Placement Unit” and collectively, the “Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement to GoGreen 1 LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor”), generating gross proceeds of $13,350,000, which is described in Note 4.


The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount equal to $281,520,000 ($10.20 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering), including certain of the proceeds of the Placement Units, was held in a trust account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.


At October 25, 2021, transaction costs amounted to $15,817,581, consisting of $15,180,000 of underwriting fees, of which $5,520,000 was paid at the closing and $9,660,000 is deferred and held in the Trust Account, and $637,581 of other offering costs.

Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (cont.)



The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account). The per-share amount to be distributed to public shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption were recorded at their redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”).” The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), Placement Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.


If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.


The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares, Placement Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.


If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by April 25, 2023 (or by July 25, 2023 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate its Business Combination in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Combination Period”) (as described in Note 11)), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company’s obligations under Cayman law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.


The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Placement Shares (any private placement equivalent securities issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of either Working Capital Loans or extension loans made to the Company) if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit of $10.00. Further on October 19, 2022, the Company and one of the underwriters executed a waiver letter and the underwriter waived $4,830,000 of the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6). Subsequently, on January 26, 2023, the Company and the second underwriter executed a waiver letter and the underwriter waived $4,830,000 of the remaining deferred underwriting fee (see Note 11).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1 — Description of Organization and Business Operations (cont.)



In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share or (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.Risks and Uncertainties 



Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Going Concern



As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $18,810, a working capital deficit of $4,179,559, accumulated deficit of $4,884,041 and net cash used in operations of $755,989.


The Company’s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain offering costs on the Company’s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (see Note 5) and a promissory note, as amended, from the Sponsor (see Note 5). Subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, the Company’s liquidity needs have been satisfied through a portion of the net proceeds from the Placement Units, and the funding of working capital loans received from its Sponsor. Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs and there is no guarantee that the Company will receive such funds. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were $300,000 and $0 outstanding under Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have sufficient working capital and will need to borrow additional funds from its Sponsor in order to fund its operations. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $200,000 from its Sponsor (see Note 11).


Furthermore, if the Company is unable to complete a business combination by April 25, 2023 (or July 25, 2023 if the Company extends the period available to complete a business combination), the Company will cease all operations except for purposes of liquidation. On January 18, 2023, the Sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which it must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the extension, on January 19, 2023, the Company issued a note (the “Extension Note”) in the principal amount of $2,760,000 to the Sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, the Sponsor deposited a payment (the “Extension Payment”) of $2,760,000 (representing $0.10 per public share) into the Trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the extension. The extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents (as described in Note 11).


In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the close of business on April 25, 2023, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. This date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC.F-9







GOGREEN INVESTMENTS CORPORATION 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)



Emerging Growth Company



The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.


Use of Estimates



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.


Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.


Cash and Cash Equivalents



The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.Investments Held in Trust Account



The Company’s portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account is comprised solely of investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government treasury obligations and generally have a readily determinable fair value. Such securities and investments in money market funds are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Interest earned is paid in kind through the issuance of additional U.S. government treasury obligations and recognized as interest income in the statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.Offering Costs



Offering costs consist of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred that are directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs of $15,371,022 and $446,539 were charged against the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares and public warrants, respectively, at October 25, 2021, based on the relative value of the Class A ordinary shares and public warrants upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering.Concentration of Credit Risk



Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.Financial Instruments



The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.F-10







GOGREEN INVESTMENTS CORPORATION 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)



Fair Value Measurement



ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used to measure investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment, characteristics specific to the investment, market conditions and other factors. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).


Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets will typically have a higher degree of input observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.


The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:



● | Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical investments at the measurement date are used.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 2—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the investment, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 pricing inputs include quoted prices for similar investments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 3—Pricing inputs are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs used in determination of fair value require significant judgment and estimation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the investment is categorized in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the investment. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the valuation of an investment in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the investment and does not necessarily correspond to the perceived risk of that investment.


Warrants



The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, was conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Management has concluded that the warrants issued in the Units and Placement Units qualify for equity accounting treatment.Redeemable Shares 



All of the 27,600,000 Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with a Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. In accordance with SEC staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480.


The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, in additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an adjustment to present the redeemable Class A ordinary shares at redemption value of $28,765,782, of which $20,798,214 was recorded against additional paid-in capital and $7,967,568 was recorded in accumulated deficit.

Income Taxes



ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” (“ASC 740”) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.



The Company is considered an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, the Company’s tax provision was zero for the periods presented.



Share Compensation Expense



The Company accounts for share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred.



The Company’s Class B ordinary shares deemed transferred to its incoming directors and advisors by way of granting of an interest in the Sponsor (see Note 5) were deemed to be within the scope of ASC 718. The fair value of equity awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo Model Simulation. The key assumptions in the option pricing model utilized were assumptions related to the expected separation date of the Units, anticipated Business Combination date, purchase price, share-price volatility, expected term, exercise date, risk-free interest rate and present value. The expected volatility as of the Initial Public Offering closing date was derived based upon similar SPAC warrants. The fair value of the Class B ordinary Share was $2,482,200 or $7.88 per share. The shares deemed transferred are subject to a performance condition, namely the occurrence of a Business Combination. This performance condition is considered in determining the grant date fair value of these instruments for valuation purposes. Compensation expense related to the Class B ordinary shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence, or more specifically when a Business Combination is consummated. Therefore, no share-based compensation expense has been recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 or for the period from March 17, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021. The unrecognized compensation expense related to the Class B ordinary shares at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $2,482,200 and will be recorded when a performance condition occurs.


During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s Sponsor transferred an additional 115,000 Class B ordinary shares as compensation to service providers. The shares transferred are subject to a performance condition, namely the occurrence of a Business Combination. This performance condition is considered in determining the grant date fair value of these instruments for valuation purposes. Compensation expense related to the Class B ordinary shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence, or more specifically when a Business Combination is consummated. Therefore, no share-based compensation expense has been recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. The unrecognized compensation expense related to the Class B ordinary shares at December 31, 2022, will be recorded when a performance condition occurs.


Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share



The Company’s statements of operations includes a presentation of income (loss) per share for Class A redeemable ordinary shares and income (loss) per share for Class A and Class B non-redeemable shares in a manner similar to the two-class method in calculating net income (loss) per ordinary share. Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for redeemable ordinary shares is computed by dividing the pro rata net income (loss) between the redeemable ordinary share and the non-redeemable ordinary share by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period, as adjusted for the effects of deemed dividend under the assumption that they represent dividends to the holders of the redeemable ordinary shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share, basic and diluted, for non-redeemable ordinary shares is computed by dividing the pro rata net income (loss) between the redeemable and non-redeemable ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)



Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share (cont.)



The calculation of diluted income (loss) per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income (loss) per ordinary share is the same as basic ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2022.



A reconciliation of net income (loss) per ordinary share as adjusted for the portion of income (loss) that is attributable to ordinary shares subject to redemption is as follows:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Note 3 — Public Offering



Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 27,600,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, including the underwriter over-allotment of 3,600,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 8).
Note 4 — Private Placement



The Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 1,335,000 Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $13,350,000, in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Each Placement Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (“Placement Share”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Placement Warrant”). Each whole Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the Placement Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering being held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Placement Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.

Founder Shares



On April 7, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 7,187,500 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, up to 937,500 of which were subject to forfeiture, for an aggregate price of $25,000. On September 21, 2021, the Sponsor forfeited 1,437,500 Founder Shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding 5,750,000 Founder Shares, up to 750,000 of which were subject to forfeiture. On October 20, 2021, the Company effectuated a share capitalization of 1,150,000 Founder Shares, resulting in an aggregate of 6,900,000 Founder Shares outstanding and held by the Sponsor, up to 900,000 of which were subject to forfeiture. The Sponsor subsequently granted an interest in the Sponsor, representing an aggregate of 200,000 Founder Shares to the members of the Company’s board of directors and advisors for the same per-share consideration that it originally paid for such shares, resulting in the Sponsor holding 6,700,000 Founder Shares after giving effect to the grant of interest. Founder Shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon consummation of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments, as described in Note 7. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to 900,000 Founder Shares to the extent the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. As a result of the underwriters’ over-allotment exercise in full, no shares are currently subject to forfeiture. On December 13, 2022, the Sponsor agreed to deposit 1,725,000 of Founder Shares (the “Sponsor Earn-Out Shares”) into escrow at the closing of the proposed Business Combination. These shares vest on trading price conditions that are met at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination (as described in Note 10).



The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.



Related-Party Loans



On March 17, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Promissory Note”). In September 2021, the Company issued to the Sponsor an Amended and Restated Promissory Note, which increased the loan amount to $500,000 and extended the due date to March 31, 2022. On October 25, 2021, the Company repaid $375,000 of borrowings outstanding under the Promissory Note.




In addition, in order to finance operations and transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into units upon consummation of the Business Combination at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units would be identical to the Placement Units. On June 6, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note (the “Note”) for borrowings of up to $300,000 from the Sponsor. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has $300,000 outstanding under the Note. On January 19, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the “Working Capital Note”) for borrowings of up to $300,000 from the Sponsor, of which $200,000 has been borrowed under the Working Capital Note as of February 24, 2023 (as described Note 11).


On January 18, 2023, the Sponsor requested that the Company extend the date by which it must consummate an initial business combination from January 25, 2023 to April 25, 2023. In connection with the extension, on January 19, 2023, the Company issued the Extension Note in the principal amount of $2,760,000 to the Sponsor. Also on January 19, 2023, the Sponsor deposited the Extension Payment of $2,760,000 (representing $0.10 per public share) into the Trust account. This deposit enabled the Company to implement the extension. The extension is the first of two three-month extensions permitted under the Company’s governing documents (as described in Note 11).


Administrative Support Agreement



The Company has agreed, commencing on the date the securities of the Company are first listed on the New York Stock Exchange through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services.

Registration Rights



The holders of the Founder Shares, Placement Units (including securities contained therein) and units (including securities contained therein) that may be issued upon conversion of extension loans or Working Capital Loans, and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Placement Warrants and any Class A ordinary shares and warrants (and underlying Class A ordinary shares) that may be issued upon conversion of units issued as part of the Working Capital Loans and Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the Founder Shares, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on October 20, 2021, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidated damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the Company’s securities.
Underwriting Agreement



The Company paid the underwriters a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $5,520,000 in the aggregate upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of (i) $0.35 per Unit of the gross proceeds of the initial 27,600,000 Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, or $9,660,000. The deferred underwriting fee will be payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On October 19, 2022, the Company and one of its underwriters executed a waiver letter and the underwriter waived $4,830,000 of the deferred underwriting fee which was recognized an adjustment to accumulated deficit. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the deferred underwriting fee payable was $4,830,000 and $9,660,000, respectively. Subsequently, on January 26, 2023, the Company and the second underwriter executed a waiver letter and the underwriter waived $4,830,000 of the remaining deferred underwriting fee (see Note 11).Placement Agent Agreements



On June 20, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a placement agent in connection with its proposed business combination. Upon consummation of the proposed business combination, the Company shall pay a transaction fee, payable in cash, of (i) two million dollars ($2,000,000) plus (ii) 2.0% of the fair market value of all of the consideration paid by investors for the securities issued in connection with the proposed business combination before deduction of the expenses related to the transaction.


On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a placement agent in connection with its proposed business combination. Upon consummation of the proposed business combination, the Company shall pay a transaction fee of (i) one million dollars ($1,000,000), (ii) 3% of the aggregate cash consideration paid for the securities issued in connection with the PIPE financing by any investor(s) who was initially identified and contracted or otherwise sourced by the placement agent, and (iii) up to 150,000 ordinary shares of the Company from the Company’s Sponsor.



Note 7 — Shareholders’ Deficit



Preference Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding.
Ordinary Shares



Class A Ordinary Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 28,935,000 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding.



Class B Ordinary Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 6,900,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.



Holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders except as required by applicable law.



The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering (not including the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Placement Units) plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, any private placement-equivalent warrants issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, any private placement equivalent securities issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of either Working Capital Loans or extension loans made to the Company).




In connection with the execution of the Lifezone Business Combination, the Sponsor agreed to deposit 1,725,000 Class B ordinary shares into escrow. These shares will be released to the Sponsor in the event that certain conditions are met within a specified time frame (see Note 10).

Note 8 — Warrants



Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.



The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A ordinary shares issuable upon such warrant exercise have been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.



The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to this registration statement or a new registration statement under the Securities Act, covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating thereto until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.



Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the warrants:




● | in whole and not in part; 
--+------------------------------


● | at a price of $0.01 per warrant; 
--+-------------------------------------


● | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants become exercisable; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification.



If the Company calls the warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Class A ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

Note 9 — Fair Value Measurements



The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques that the Company utilized to determine such fair value.
