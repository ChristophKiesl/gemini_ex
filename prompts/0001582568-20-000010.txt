Overview
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (“PBF GP”), our general partner, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF Energy Company LLC (“PBF LLC”). PBF Energy Inc. is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and, as of December 31, 2019, owned 99.0% of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. We refer you to “Organizational Structure” below for an illustration of our relationship with PBF Energy Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “PBF Energy” refer collectively to PBF Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than PBFX and its subsidiaries, and our general partner. PBFX’s common units trade on the NYSE under the symbol “PBFX,” and, as of December 31, 2019, PBF LLC held a 48.2% limited partner interest in us, and a non-economic general partner interest, with the remaining 51.8% limited partner interest held by public unitholders. 

Our business includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil, refined products, natural gas and intermediates transportation, terminaling, storage and processing assets, including those previously operated and owned by subsidiaries of PBF Holding Company LLC (“PBF Holding”) and PBF Holding’s previously held subsidiaries.
Business Developments
Rail Agreement Amendments
On February 13, 2019, we amended the existing Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement, by and between Delaware City Terminaling Company LLC (“DCTC”) and PBF Holding (as amended effective January 1, 2019, the “Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement”) for the inclusion of services through certain rail infrastructure (the “East Coast Rail Assets”) at the East Coast Storage Assets (as defined below). We also entered into a new Terminaling Services Agreement, by and between DCTC and PBF Holding (the “Terminaling Services Agreement”), with a four-year term starting in 2022 subsequent to the expiration of the Amended and Restated Delaware City Rail Terminaling Services Agreement, related to the DCR Rail Facility (as defined below) and the East Coast Rail Assets, which will reduce 
5

the MVC to 95,000 bpd and includes additional services to be provided by us as operator of facilities owned by PBF Holding’s subsidiaries.
IDR Restructuring Agreement
On February 28, 2019, we closed on the transaction contemplated by the Equity Restructuring Agreement (the “IDR Restructuring Agreement”) with PBF LLC and PBF GP, pursuant to which our IDRs held by PBF LLC were canceled and converted into 10,000,000 newly issued PBFX common units (the “IDR Restructuring”). Transaction costs related to the IDR Restructuring were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and are included in “General and administrative expenses” within the Partnership’s consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the closing of the IDR Restructuring, no distributions were made to PBF LLC with respect to the IDRs, and the newly issued PBFX common units are entitled to normal distributions. 
2019 Registered Direct Offering
On April 24, 2019, we entered into subscription agreements to sell an aggregate of 6,585,500 common units to certain institutional investors in a registered direct public offering (the “2019 Registered Direct Offering”) for gross proceeds of approximately $135.0 million. The 2019 Registered Direct Offering closed on April 29, 2019. 
TVPC Acquisition
On April 24, 2019, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with PBF LLC (the “TVPC Contribution Agreement”), pursuant to which PBF LLC contributed to us all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of TVP Holding Company LLC (“TVP Holding”), which held the remaining 50% equity interest in Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (“TVPC”), for total consideration of $200.0 million (the “TVPC Acquisition”). Subsequent to the closing of the TVPC Acquisition on May 31, 2019, we own 100% of the equity interest in TVPC. The transaction was financed through a combination of proceeds from the 2019 Registered Direct Offering and borrowings under our five-year, $500.0 million amended and restated revolving credit facility (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
CPI Contingent Consideration
On October 1, 2018, we closed the acquisition of CPI Operations LLC (“CPI”), whose assets include a storage facility with multi-use storage capacity, an Aframax-capable marine facility, a rail facility, a truck terminal, equipment, contracts and certain other idled assets (the “East Coast Storage Assets”) located on the Delaware River near Paulsboro, New Jersey (the “East Coast Storage Assets Acquisition”). In connection with the acquisition, the purchase and sale agreement includes an earn-out provision related to an existing commercial agreement with a third party, based on the future results of certain of the acquired idled assets (the “Contingent Consideration”), which recommenced operations in October 2019 and began revenue generating activities.
Principles of Combination and Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
In connection with, and subsequent to, the IPO, we acquired certain assets from PBF LLC (collectively referred to as the “Contributed Assets”). Such acquisitions completed subsequent to the IPO were made through a series of dropdown transactions with PBF LLC (collectively referred to as the “Acquisitions from PBF”). The financial statements presented in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” in this Form 10-K include our consolidated financial results and that of PBF MLP Predecessor, our predecessor for accounting purposes (our “Predecessor”), for periods presented, as applicable, related to the historical results of the Acquisitions from PBF prior to the effective date of each transaction with the exception of the Delaware Ethanol Storage Facility (as defined below), which is considered an asset purchase. We recorded the Acquisitions from PBF at PBF Energy’s historical book value, as the Acquisitions from PBF were treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. 
6

In general, our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenue independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the DCR Products Pipeline and the Paulsboro Lube Oil Terminal (each as defined below). In connection with the closing of the IPO and each of the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy, under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenue. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil, refined products and natural gas from sources located throughout the U.S. and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries located in Paulsboro, New Jersey; Delaware City, Delaware; Toledo, Ohio; Chalmette, Louisiana; and Torrance, California. In addition, we generate third-party revenue from certain of our assets.
Since we do not own any of the crude oil, refined products or natural gas that we handle nor engage in the trading of crude oil, refined products or natural gas, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. However, these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long term through their effects on our customer’s operations. A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from PBF Energy under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include MVCs. Refer to Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the commercial agreements with PBF Holding.
The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account their share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing their federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and fair market value of PBFX’s assets, the acquisition price of such partner’s units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of PBF Logistics LP (as amended, our “partnership agreement”).

(b) | As a result of the completion of the Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2017, we fully repaid the promissory note and related accrued interest.

Commercial Agreements
We currently derive a majority of our revenue from long-term, fee-based agreements with PBF Holding, which generally include MVCs and contractual fee escalations for inflation adjustments and certain increases in operating costs. We believe the terms and conditions under these agreements, as well as the Omnibus Agreement and the Services Agreement (each as defined below), each with PBF Holding, are generally no less favorable to either party than those that could have been negotiated with unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. 
Refer to Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the commercial agreements with PBF Holding. 
12

Omnibus Agreement 
In addition to the commercial agreements described above, we entered into an omnibus agreement with PBF GP, PBF LLC and PBF Holding, which has been amended and restated in connection with certain of the Acquisitions from PBF (as amended, the “Omnibus Agreement”) for the provision of executive management services and support for accounting and finance, legal, human resources, information technology, environmental, health and safety, and other administrative functions, as well as (i) PBF LLC’s agreement not to compete with us under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) our right of first offer for ten years to acquire certain logistics assets retained by PBF Energy following the IPO, including certain logistics assets that PBF LLC or its subsidiaries may construct or acquire in the future, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) a license to use our trademark and name.
The annual fee under the Omnibus Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.7 million, inclusive of obligations under the Omnibus Agreement to reimburse PBF LLC for certain compensation and benefit costs of employees who devoted more than 50% of their time to us during the year ended December 31, 2019. The annual fee was increased to $8.3 million effective as of January 1, 2020, inclusive of estimated obligations under the Omnibus Agreement to reimburse PBF LLC for certain compensation and benefit costs of employees who devote more than 50% of their time to us for the year ending December 31, 2020. 
Services Agreement
Additionally, we entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement with PBF Holding and certain of its subsidiaries (as amended, the “Services Agreement”), pursuant to which PBF Holding and its subsidiaries provide us with the personnel necessary for us to perform our obligations under our commercial agreements. We reimburse PBF Holding for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to our operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid an annual fee of $8.6 million to PBF Holding pursuant to the Services Agreement and expect to pay the same annual fee to PBF Holding pursuant to the Services Agreement for the year ending December 31, 2020.
The Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Omnibus Agreement, provided that we may terminate any service on 30-days’ notice.
Properties
Our principal properties are described above in “Assets and Operations.” We believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained. Our corporate office is located in the same office as PBF Energy. PBF Energy leases approximately 58,000 square feet for its principal corporate office in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for PBF Energy’s principal corporate office expires in 2022. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and health, safety and environmental management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions.
Additionally, we lease approximately 5,000 square feet for our regional corporate office in The Woodlands, Texas. The lease for The Woodlands office expires in 2022. Functions performed in The Woodlands include pipeline control center operations and logistics operations, engineering and regulatory support functions.
Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy, through certain of its subsidiaries, indemnifies us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of the Contributed Assets arising at 
13

or before the closing of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. Refer to “Environmental Regulations, Environmental Liabilities” below for a more detailed discussion of PBF Energy’s indemnification obligations.
Competition
As a result of our contractual relationship with PBF Energy and our direct connection to all of its refineries, we believe that our terminals, pipelines and storage facilities will not face significant competition from other terminals, pipelines and storage facilities for PBF Energy’s transportation and storage requirements with respect to the services provided under our commercial agreements.
If PBF Energy reduces its crude oil deliveries handled through our crude oil unloading terminals, we may only receive revenues associated with our MVCs, which may cause a decrease in our revenue. PBF Energy may elect to ship crude oil to its refineries via pipeline or through its refinery marine facilities, which we do not own, as an alternative mode of crude oil transportation. PBF Energy competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil storage, supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own storage, distribution and marketing systems. PBF Energy also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined petroleum products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries.
The East Coast Terminals, the Knoxville Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets compete with other terminal and storage facilities, in terms of fees, and other qualitative factors, including those affiliated with integrated petroleum companies. Competition related to the East Coast Terminals, the Knoxville Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets is affected significantly by the volume of products produced, transported and available in the geographic area and the cost to transport products from distant locations.
Safety and Maintenance
We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our facilities and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets in accordance with good industry practices and as required by regulation.
Our terminal, pipeline and storage facilities have response plans, spill prevention and control plans, fire response plans, and other programs designed to effectively respond to emergencies. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations.
Our pipelines are subject to strict safety laws and regulations for the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Transportation involves a risk that hazardous liquids or gases may be released into the environment, which could cause harm to the public or the environment. The DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of pipeline assets, which affect our pipelines. These regulations contain requirements for pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection, testing and maintenance or repairs of the pipelines. The DOT regulations also require pipeline operation and maintenance personnel to meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. We believe that we are in compliance with all of the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations on pipeline safety. 
Employee Safety
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance 
14

with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
Insurance
Terminals and storage facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and/or are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of PBF Energy and/or certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits applicable to us, which we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. As we continue to grow, we will continue to monitor limits and retentions under our policies and those of PBF Energy and/or its subsidiaries as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program.
Terminal and Pipeline Control Operations
Our terminals, facilities and pipelines are generally automated, but are continuously supervised by either our employees (including our employees located at The Woodlands office), or PBF Energy employees. At the terminals, our customers’ truck drivers are provided with security badges or other credentials to access and use these facilities. In addition, individual trucks are required to be registered in either our, or PBF Energy’s, system to ensure that required regulatory inspections are maintained by either our customers, PBF Energy’s customers, or their common carriers.
Environmental Regulation
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act restricts certain activities that may affect endangered species or their environments. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species or habitats could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating limitations or bans in the affected area.
Environmental Liabilities
Contaminations resulting from spills of crude oil or petroleum products are not unusual within the petroleum terminaling or transportation industries. Historic spills at truck and rail racks and terminals have resulted in contamination of the environment, including soils and groundwater. 
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreements entered into in connection with the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF, PBF Energy has agreed to indemnify us for certain known and unknown environmental liabilities that are based on conditions in existence at our Predecessor’s properties and associated with the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets and arising from the conditions that existed prior to the closings of the IPO and the Acquisitions from PBF. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify PBF Energy for (i) certain events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets that occur, as applicable, after the closing of each Acquisition from PBF (including the IPO) and (ii) environmental liabilities related to our assets if the environmental liability is the result of the negligence, willful misconduct or criminal conduct of us or our employees, including those seconded to us. As a result, we may incur environmental expenses in the future, which may be substantial.
15

As of December 31, 2019, we have recorded a total liability related to environmental remediation costs of $2.3 million related to existing environmental liabilities. Refer to Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Seasonality
The crude oil, refined products and natural gas that is throughput, stored and processed at our facilities are affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil, refined products and natural gas in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with PBF Energy that include MVCs and are consistent each calendar quarter or year. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries employ 92 employees at the East Coast Terminals, the East Coast Storage Assets and other locations, including the Toledo Products Terminal, the Knoxville Terminal and The Woodlands Office as follows: 
The union employees at the East Coast Terminals and the East Coast Storage Assets are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the USW. The agreement with the USW covering the East Coast Terminals is scheduled to expire in April 2024 and the agreement with the USW covering the East Coast Storage Assets is scheduled to expire in January 2022. We consider our relations with these represented employees to be satisfactory.
All of our executive management personnel are currently employees of PBF Energy or subsidiaries of PBF Energy and devote such portion of their time to our business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct our operations. The other personnel that conduct our operations are employees of PBF Holding or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, we pay an annual fee to PBF Energy for the provision of various centralized administrative services and reimburse PBF Energy for certain direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by PBF Energy on our behalf. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, we use employees of PBF Energy to operate certain of our assets and PBF Energy is reimbursed for such employees through an annual fee, which also includes 
16

provisions of certain utilities and other infrastructure-related services. Refer to “Agreements with PBF Energy” included in “Item 1. Business” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
In addition, PBF Energy and its affiliates have entered into rail operations services agreements with unaffiliated third parties (the “Rail Services Providers”), to provide crude oil unloading and other operations services for the Delaware City, Toledo and Chalmette refineries. Under the rail operations services agreements, the Rail Services Providers are responsible for providing the personnel necessary for the performance of our operations services. The Rail Services Providers are at all times considered independent contractors, and none of their employees or contractors are considered an employee, representative or agent of us or PBF Energy or its subsidiaries. The costs of the Rail Services Providers’ services provided to us are passed through to us by PBF Holding and its subsidiaries. From time to time, certain other third parties may provide operating services to us in a capacity as independent contractors.
