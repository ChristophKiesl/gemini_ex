ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
    Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘IEA’’, the ‘‘Company’’, ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, or ‘‘our’’) is a holding company that, through various subsidiaries, is a leading diversified infrastructure construction company with specialized energy and heavy civil expertise throughout the United States (“U.S.”). We were founded in 1947 as White Construction and we became a public company in March 2018 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‘‘IEA’’, and certain of our warrants trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‘‘IEAWW’’. 
Reportable Segments
    The Company operates its business in two reportable segments:
Renewables Segment
    The Renewables segment operates throughout the U.S. and specializes in providing complete engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services for the renewable energy, traditional power and civil infrastructure industries. In 2021, Engineering News-Record (“ENR”) ranked IEA as the 2nd leading provider of wind and the 8th leading provider of solar EPC services based on revenue. These services include the design, site development, construction, installation and restoration of infrastructure. 
We have maintained a heavy focus on construction of renewable power production capacity as renewable energy, particularly from wind and solar, has become widely accepted within the electric utility industry and has become a cost-effective solution for the creation of new generating capacity. We believe we have the ability to continue to expand these services to leverage our expertise and relationships in the wind energy business to provide additional infrastructure solutions to the clean energy markets.
Specialty Civil Segment
    The Specialty Civil segment operates throughout the U.S. and specializes in a range of services that creates a diverse national platform of construction capabilities, including:
•Environmental remediation services such as site development, environmental site closure, outsourced contract mining and coal ash management services.

•Rail Infrastructure services such as planning, design, procurement, construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects for major railway and intermodal facilities.
•Heavy civil construction services such as road and bridge construction, specialty paving, industrial maintenance and other local, state and government projects.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy have remained consistent and are as follows:

Retain strong relationships with our customers to expand services offered — We believe that we have strong, long-term relationships with each of our customers and have historically worked together with them to meet their needs. By leveraging our established relationships with these customers, we intend to provide expanded products and services that will continue to diversify our revenue streams and assist our customers with their business strategies.
    Maintain operational excellence — We have a continual focus on maintaining operational excellence, which includes the following:
•Quality - We believe in satisfying our clients, mitigating risk, and driving improvement by performing 
work right the first time.
•Technical Expertise - We have an established reputation for safe, high quality performance, reliable customer service and technical expertise in constructing technically demanding projects.
•Safety - We believe the safety of our employees, the public and the environment is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents.
•Productivity - We strive to use our resources efficiently to deliver work on time and on budget.
    Own our equipment — Many of our services are equipment intensive and certain key equipment used by us is specialized or customized for our businesses. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership in a large and varied construction fleet enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability and maximizing returns on investment of the equipment.
Maintain a strong balance sheet — We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as our strong and long-standing relationship with our sureties, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and bonds. We will also continue to focus on optimizing our capital structure in order to find the best mix of debt and equity financing that can maximize our market value while minimizing our cost of capital. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability and to augment our liquidity needs. 
Pursue future strategic acquisitions and arrangements — We will continue to pursue selected and opportunistic acquisitions that fit our strategy of acquiring businesses with complementary cultures, niche market capabilities, excellent relationships with blue chip customers and strong, proven management teams.
Backlog
Backlog is discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Customers
    We have longstanding customer relationships with many established companies in the renewable energy, thermal power, environmental remediation, civil and industrial power industries, as well as with original equipment manufacturers that produce the equipment for our business. We have completed renewable projects for top U.S. developers and owners, rail infrastructure projects with top tier railroads and heavy civil construction projects with many government agencies. 
Our renewable projects are considered individual customers as generally each project's developer forms its own project legal entity. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customers accounted for 7% of our consolidated revenues and our ten largest customers accounted for 37.2% of our consolidated revenues. 
Although we are not dependent upon any one customer in any year, we are responsible for developing and maintaining existing relationships with customers to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Our management is also focused on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.
    Our work is generally performed pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire complex of specified units within an infrastructure system. Generally, customers are billed monthly throughout the completion of work on a project; however, some contracts provide for billing upon the achievement of specific completion milestones, which may increase the billing period to more than one month. Many contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% to 10% of the contract price is withheld until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers.
    We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the 
relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. 
Competition
    We compete with a number of companies in our markets, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, and some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform some of the services we provide.

    The primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation, quality and delivery, relevant expertise, adequate financial resources, geographic presence, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. We believe that our national platform, track record of completion, relationships with vendors, strong safety record and access to skilled labor enables us to compete favorably in all of these factors. We also believe that our ability to provide unionized and non-unionized workforces across a national footprint allows us to compete for a broad range of projects. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. We believe our safety record, experience, quality of service and price are often principal factors in determining which service provider is selected.
Seasonality
    Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules and holidays. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Significant Factors Impacting Results-Seasonality.’’
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
    We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees. Our business units have established robust safety programs to encourage, monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations including, behavioral based safety, jobsite safety analysis, site-specific safety orientation, subcontractor orientation, site safety audits, accident and incident safety investigations, OSHA 30-hour and 10-hour training, drug and alcohol testing and regular trainings in fall protection, confined spaces, crane rigging and flagman, first aid, CPR and AED, among others. We require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees based upon their safety performance. 
    Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we may be subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. We maintain insurance policies for worker’s compensation, employer liability, automobile liability, general liability, inland marine property and equipment, professional and pollution liability, excess liability, and director and officers’ liability.
    Our business may subject us to the risk of adverse site conditions and unfavorable weather. While we mitigate these risks contractually to the extent possible, market conditions may prevent us from fully passing these risks to our customers, and there is not a robust insurance market to cover some of these risks. For example, we have evaluated the feasibility of insurance products to mitigate weather risk, but we do not believe that the current insurance market offers commercially practicable solutions to protect us against significant losses caused by adverse weather.
Suppliers and Materials
    Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects, such as wind turbines and solar panels, and we are responsible for the installation, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. 
    We may utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. 
    We bear some risk of increases in the price of materials and supplies used in the performance of our work, such as aggregate, reinforced steel, cable, and fuel. These risks are managed contractually, by entering into contracts with suppliers that 
fix the price paid by the Company within the budget established for a project, by passing the risk of commodity cost increases to the customer, or by purchasing materials and supplies at the time of the issuance of the contract notice to proceed. 
We are experiencing supply chain disruptions in our end markets related to the following issues;
•Labor shortages at suppliers have increased delays of the production of certain materials, including but not limited to machinery, tools, copper, reinforced steel, solar panels and other items; 
•Shipping costs have increased significantly due to higher demand for products but fewer delivery options due to a reduction of truck drivers and rail cars; 
•Delayed sequencing in our projects related to the inability to determine specific delivery dates for key materials;
•Cost increases for tax, tariffs and border controls for materials entering the U.S. from other countries; and 
•Bans on imports of certain goods from China, particularly of polysilicon covered by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which is a significant input in the production of solar panels. These bans could result in project delays and increased costs to us or our customers.
We continue to monitor these supply chain disruptions and other logistical challenges, global trade relationships (e.g., tariffs, sourcing restrictions) and other general market and political conditions (e.g., inflation, Ukraine conflict) with respect to availability and costs of certain materials and equipment necessary for the performance of our business and for materials necessary for our customers’ projects. For example, in the renewable energy market are experiencing supply chain challenges, resulting in delays and shortages of, and increased costs for, materials necessary for the construction of certain renewable energy projects in the near term, including as a result of sourcing restrictions related to solar panels manufactured in China. While we believe many of our renewable energy customers may be able to manage near-term supply chain disruptions better than their smaller competitors, these challenges could delay our customers’ ongoing projects or impact their future project schedules, which in turn could impact the timing of our projects. While these delays are not anticipated to result in exposure to liquidated damages or commodity risks, such delays could cause our customers to cancel projects as higher than expected costs impact their project profitability projections which could impact our profitability and cash flow.
Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations including:
•licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;
•regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;
•permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;
•wage and hour regulations;
•regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;
•building and electrical codes; and
•special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Environmental and Climate Change Matters
    We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
    The potential impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensity and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather and major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity and increases in certain other costs, which could negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
We are affected by environmental and climate change matters but as a Company, we are focused on building a greener future, one wind turbine and solar panel at a time. There’s no question that the increased production and usage of renewable energy is crucial to reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. We are proud to support this collective mission by leveraging our in-house expertise to build reliable infrastructure across all phases of the renewable energy lifecycle. From power generation to delivery, we can handle it all. Since entering the renewable energy market, IEA has become one of the largest utility-scale wind farm contractors in the country, completing more than 257 wind and solar projects and generating more than 24.4 GW of renewable energy. It is our goal, as we continue to grow, to expand and refine our renewable energy infrastructure construction capabilities, while minimizing environmental impact at every stage.
Production Tax Credit (the ‘‘PTC’’) and Investment Tax Credit (‘‘ITC’’)
    In light of changes in federal government priorities and the cost-competitiveness of wind and solar power production, certain of the tax credits for production of renewable energy are phasing out. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (‘‘CAA’’), which contains certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, provided for the gradual elimination of certain of these incentives. In December 2020, the federal government implemented an agreement that extended lapsed and expiring tax breaks. The extension provides a one year extension of the production tax credit (the "PTC") for wind projects at a 60% level for projects that begin construction on or before December 31, 2021 and a two year extension of 26% solar investment tax credit (the "Solar ITC") for projects that begin construction before January 1, 2023 and 22% ITC for solar projects that begin construction before January 1, 2024 for all solar projects placed into service prior to December 31, 2025. The Solar ITC will permanently remain at 10% for projects that commence in 2024 and onwards. On June 29, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") issued a notice which provides that projects that began construction in 2016-2019 have six years, and projects that began construction in 2020 have five years from the date construction began to be placed-in-service to qualify for the PTC or ITC that was in effect when construction began. This new rule effectively extends the amount of time that many projects will be eligible for PTC to 2025.
Human Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 835 salaried employees and 2,883 hourly employees. The total number of personnel employed is subject to the volume of specialty services and construction work in progress, as our employee base ranged from a low of 3,000 employees to 5,600 employees during the year. 
We believe that our employees are the most valuable resource in successfully completing our projects. We believe our ability to maintain sufficient, continuous work for hourly employees helps us to maintain a stable workforce with a loyalty to and an understanding of our policies and culture and contributes to our strong performance, safety and quality record. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. In addition, we have partnerships with technical schools where we recruit and hire craft employees.
We strive to employ a dynamic mix of people to create the strongest company possible. Our policy forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive company with people of various backgrounds, experience, culture, styles and talents.
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total compensation programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to base wages, we provide annual bonus opportunities, a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs.
We strive to develop and sustain a skilled labor advantage by providing on and off-site training programs, project management training, and leadership development programs. Our leadership development program is designed to further develop each participant’s leadership skills and requires program participants to challenge themselves and their peers as they progress.
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews monthly and are included in the determination of the annual bonus, and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a safety culture.
We continue to address the longer-term need for additional labor resources in our markets, as we address an aging workforce and longer-term labor availability issues, increasing pressure to reduce costs and improve reliability, and increasing duration and complexity of their capital programs. We believe these trends will continue, possibly to such a degree that demand for labor resources will outpace supply. Furthermore, the cyclical nature of our business can create shortages of qualified labor in those markets during periods of high demand. Our ability to capitalize on available opportunities is limited 
by our ability to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel.
