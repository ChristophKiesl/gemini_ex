 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview and Business Model
    Luna Innovations Incorporated ("we" or the "Company") is a leader in advanced optical technology, providing high performance fiber optic test, measurement and control products for the telecommunications and photonics industries; and distributed fiber optic sensing solutions that measure, or “sense,” the structures for industries ranging from aerospace, automotive, energy, oil and gas, security and infrastructure. 
Our communications test and control products help customers test their fiber optic networks and assemblies with speed and precision in both lab and production environments, accelerating the development of fiber optic products and assuring accurate testing of optical components like photonic integrated circuits ("PICs") and coherent receivers, which are both critical elements of meeting the world’s exponentially growing demand for bandwidth. Our distributed fiber optic sensing products help designers and manufacturers more efficiently develop new and innovative products by measuring stress, strain, and temperature at a high resolution for new designs or manufacturing processes. In addition, our distributed fiber optic sensing products ensure the safety and structural integrity or operational health of critical assets in the field, by monitoring stress, strain, and vibration in large civil and industrial infrastructure such as bridges, roads, pipelines and borders. We also provide applied research services, typically under research programs funded by the U.S. government, in areas of sensing and instrumentation, advanced materials, optical technologies and health sciences.
We are organized into two main reporting segments, our Lightwave segment and our Luna Labs segment. Our Lightwave segment consists of our fiber optics testing, measurement and sensing solutions. Our Lightwave segment revenues represented approximately 71% and 70% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
    Our Luna Labs segment performs applied research principally in the areas of sensing and instrumentation, advanced materials, optical technologies and health sciences. Our Luna Labs segment comprised approximately 29% and 30% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Most of the government funding for our Luna Labs segment is derived from the Small Business Innovation Research ("SBIR") program coordinated by the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA"). 
    Our SBIR research is focused on technological areas with commercial potential and we strive to commercialize any resulting scientific advancements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of our total revenues were generated under the SBIR program, compared to 35% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
    For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 35% and 40%, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from the U.S. government.
Acquisitions
OptaSense Holdings Limited
On December 3, 2020, we acquired OptaSense Holdings Limited ("OptaSense") for $38.9 million, or £29.0 million, in cash. OptaSense, based in Farnborough, United Kingdom ("UK") and formerly owned by QinetiQ Holdings Limited, is a market leader in fiber optic distributed monitoring solutions for pipelines, oilfield services, security, highways and railways, and in power and utilities monitoring systems. The acquisition of OptaSense provided us with important distributed acoustic sensing ("DAS") intellectual property and products. OptaSense's technology and products and geographic footprint are highly complementary to our Lightwave segment which we believe will accelerate our technology roadmap and overall growth. 
 General Photonics Corporation
On March 1, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of General Photonics Corporation ("GP"), a leading provider of innovative components, modules and test equipment focused on the generation, measurement and control of polarized light critical in fiber optic-based applications for aggregate consideration of $20.0 million, inclusive of $19.0 million paid at closing and $1.0 million of contingent consideration paid in 2020 related to certain earn-out provisions. 
Lightwave 
Our Lightwave segment develops, manufactures and markets distributed fiber optic sensing products and fiber optic communications test and control products. We develop and commercialize our fiber optic technology for sensing applications for aerospace, automotive, energy and infrastructure as well as for test and measurement applications in the telecommunications and data communications industries. Our Lightwave segment also performs applied research principally in the areas of optical and terahertz technologies. 
Our key initiative for long term growth is to become a leading provider of fiber optic test, measurement, control and sensing equipment. The acquisition of OptaSense added distributed acoustic sensing technology to our existing suite of sensing products and provided for expansion into high-growth markets such as security and perimeter detection, smart infrastructure monitoring and oil and gas. Our products have historically been strong in long-range, discrete sensing and short range, fully distributed sensing which are best when specific, known locations needed to be monitored. OptaSense's product offering has helped us fill a gap for long range, fully distributed measurement, which is best for applications where signals can occur anywhere along the length of the sensor. 
Our primary product lines in our Lightwave segment are described in more detail below.
Communications Test and Photonic Controls Products
Test and Measurement Equipment for Fiber Optic Components and Sub-Assemblies
Our product lines in the optical test and measurement domain include our Optical Vector Analyzer, our Optical Backscatter Reflectometer, and our Phoenix family of tunable lasers.
    Our optical test and measurement products primarily serve the telecommunications industry, as well as provide valuable applications in other fields. Our test and measurement products test and monitor the integrity of fiber optic network components and sub-assemblies. These products are designed for manufacturers and suppliers of optical components and sub-assemblies allowing them to reduce development, test and production costs and improve the quality of their products. Our products are particularly useful for characterizing and testing photonic integrated circuits, such as silicon photonics components, which are a critical technology enabling the growing worldwide demand for internet connectivity. Most manufacturers and suppliers of optical components and modules currently use a combination of different types of optical test equipment to measure performance and identify failures in optical networks, such as bad splices, bends, crimps and other reflective and non-reflective events that can cause defects and negatively impact product performance. Our optical test equipment products eliminate the need to employ multiple test products by addressing all stages of the end user’s product development lifecycle, including design verification, component qualification, assembly process verification and failure analysis.
Polarization Control
    Our polarization control products include components, modules and instruments to measure, manage and control polarization and group delay in fiber optic networks. Our proprietary fiber optic squeezing technology enables a high- performance polarization control and measurement system for the accurate measurement of polarization properties of light sources and optical materials. We also manufacture and sell fiber optic coils for use in gyroscopes.
Tunable Lasers
    Our swept tunable lasers are integrated into current and new products to help customers build faster, more flexible and cost-effective test and measurement products. Our laser has desirable properties in the quality of the laser light produced, the speed at which it can operate, the small size of the package, and the environmental conditions in which it can operate, making it possible to bring these capabilities out of the laboratory, and into more demanding environments such as aircraft structural health monitoring, automotive manufacturing, green energy and industrial applications.
Sensing and Non-Destructive Test Products
ODiSI Sensing Solution
    Our ODiSI products provide fully distributed strain and temperature measurements delivering an extraordinary amount of data by using an optical fiber as a continuous sensor to produce measurements every millimeter for a sensor up to 50 meters in length. Compared to traditional sensing methods, such as electrical strain gages, this technology provides greater insight into the performance, tolerances and failure mechanisms of composite structures and vehicles and can be integrated into locations and environments not accessible with traditional sensors. We believe our ODiSI products provide exceptional value to the 
aerospace and automotive industries as they continue to adopt electrification and move to lighter weight systems made of composite structures.
ODiSI incorporates multiple channels of fiber optic sensors whose inputs are integrated through an advanced measurement system and software using fiber optic sensing technology with our innovative monitoring system that allows several thousand sensors to be networked along a single optical fiber.
Hyperion Sensing Solution
Our Hyperion sensing products expand our capabilities in fiber optic sensing by providing distributed sensing using hundreds of Fiber-Bragg Grating ("FBG") or Extrinsic Fabry-Perot ("FP") sensors integrated into long-rage sensors of up to 40km in length, measured at sampling rates up to 5KHz. Hyperion enables rapid full-spectrum data acquisition and flexible peak detect algorithms of FBGs, Long Period FBGs and FP sensors with low-latency access to data for closed-loop feedback applications. Our Hyperion products target fiber optic sensing applications that require more dynamic measurement capabilities or longer distances than provided by our ODiSI platform, like monitoring of large, civil and industrial infrastructure. 
Terahertz Sensing Systems
    Our Terametrix terahertz ("THz") gauging and imaging product line uses pulsed THz waves to provide precise single- and multi-layer thickness, density, basis weight and caliper thickness measurements to serve the industrial, non-destructive testing, and research markets. Similar to x-ray images, THz wavelengths penetrate through most non-conductive materials and can easily reveal imperfections such as voids, cracks, and density variations. THz offers a significant advantage over x-rays because the radiation is non-ionizing and thus is completely safe.  THz technology, unlike other traditional methods, is non-contact, works with both opaque and translucent materials, and works well for multilayer structures. The ability to accurately measure layer thickness is critical for ensuring consistent quality, minimizing defects and reducing material usage for products such as tubing, tires, plastic bottles, adhesives and coatings. Handheld THz sensors can measure and scan specialty coatings and multilayer structures to check thickness consistency and locate subsurface defects. THz systems can be used to inspect the high-performance coatings used on military aircraft, verifying thickness of applied coatings with submicron accuracy.
Distributed Acoustic Sensing Products
OptaSense
Our line of advanced DAS interrogator units deliver superior measurements for a wide range of applications from advanced industrial monitoring through high performance geophysical measurements. Applications of these units include real-time pipeline monitoring preventing disruption flow, advance monitoring and evaluation of reservoir and wellbore to reduce risk and optimize recovery, real-time information detection on highways and railways for traffic management and ensuring safety, cost-effective surveillance of borders and national assets and the precise detection of faults in power and utility infrastructure. Our DAS operations include a market leading laser technology company that supports and vertically integrates the most critical element of the DAS system, its internal laser. 
Sales and Marketing
    We primarily market our fiber optic test, measurement and control products to telecommunications companies, defense agencies, government system integrators, researchers, original equipment manufacturers, distributors, testing labs and strategic partners worldwide. We have a regional sales force that markets and sells our products directly as well as through manufacturer representative organizations to customers in North America and through partner and distribution channels for sales outside of North America, including the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions. We have a dedicated sales force for direct marketing of our distributed sensing products, with an initial focus on customers in the automotive, aerospace, and energy industries.
    We sell and market our THz instruments primarily to original equipment manufacturers through a mix of technical sales engineers, value added resellers and independent sales representatives. We market these products and capabilities through industry specific channels, including the internet, industry trade shows and through trade journals.
    We believe that we provide a high level of support in developing and maintaining our long-term relationships with our customers. Customer service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners that are located throughout the world.
Luna Labs
    We provide applied research for customers in our primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials such as coatings, adhesives, composites and bio-engineered materials. We generally compete to win contracts in these areas on a fee-for-service basis. Our Luna Labs segment has a successful track record of evaluating innovative technologies to address the needs of our customers.
    We seek to maximize the benefits of our contract research business by generating revenue and identifying promising technologies to develop. We focus primarily on opportunities in which we develop intellectual property rights in areas that we believe we can commercialize. We take a disciplined approach to contract research to ensure the costs of contracts we undertake will be fully reimbursed. We believe this model is cost-efficient and significantly reduces our development risk by enabling us to defray the development costs of higher risk technology with third-party funding. 
    While we conduct our applied research on a fee-for-service basis for third parties, we seek to retain full or partial rights to the technologies and patents we develop under these contracts to continuously enlarge and strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. New technology that we develop may complement our existing technologies and enable us to develop applications and products that were previously not possible. In addition, the new technologies we develop may have commercial markets beyond the scope of the applications originally contemplated in the contract research stage, and we endeavor to capture the value of those opportunities. Funded research and development within this business segment was $23.6 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
    Each year, U.S. government federal agencies and departments are required to allocate a portion of their grant awards for SBIR-qualified organizations. SBIR contracts include Phase I feasibility contracts of up to $225,000 and Phase II proof-of-concept contracts, which can be as high as $1,500,000. We have won three National Tibbetts Awards from the SBA for outstanding SBIR performance. We have also won research contracts outside the SBIR program from corporations and government entities. These contracts typically have a longer duration and higher value than SBIR grants. In the future, we seek to derive a larger portion of our contract research revenues from contracts outside of the SBIR program.
Materials
    We are actively developing a wide variety of materials. For example, we have developed a range of coatings, including both hydrophobic and superoleophobic coatings. These coatings are being evaluated for use in a number of applications. Other coatings under development include anti-corrosion and damage-indicating coatings.
    We are also working on a variety of bioengineered materials for homeostatic agents and wound healing. These materials must be approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies before they can be marketed, which we do not expect to occur for at least several years, if at all.
Sensing
    Our Luna Labs segment also performs a significant amount of applied research towards developing new sensors. This includes sensors for the purpose of corrosion, temperature, strain, pressure, structural health and chemical detection. Much of the work is directed to harsh environments and uses optics. Examples include measuring temperature and neutron flux in nuclear reactors, pressure and temperature in gas turbines and temperatures of cryogenic lines. The effort utilizes both discrete and distributed sensors. Our technology development work in this area is closely aligned with our Lightwave segment and is directed at advancing the technology and the development of new applications.
Intellectual Property
    We seek patent protection on inventions that we consider important to the operations of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We control access to our proprietary technology and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties.
    Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for our products, including successfully defending our patents against third-party challenges both in the United States and in other countries. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that we own or have licensed valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because we may not be able to obtain patent protection on some or all 
of our technology and because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.
    Currently, we own or license approximately 527 U.S. and international patents and approximately 122 U.S. and international patent applications. Our issued patents generally have terms that are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2037. The patents scheduled to expire in 2021 are not expected to have a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future pending patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Claims allowed under any issued patent or future issued patent owned or licensed by us may not be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technologies. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and, in addition, the rights under such patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. To the extent we elect to pursue, intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture or increase their market share with respect to related technologies.
    A discussion of our material in-licensed patents is set forth below.
Shape Sensing Patents
    As a part of our sale of assets associated with our fiber optic shape sensing technology in the medical field to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ("Intuitive") in 2014, we transferred our related patents to Intuitive. Also, as a part of this transaction, we entered into a revocable license agreement with Intuitive pursuant to which we have the right to use all of our transferred technology outside the field of medicine and in respect of our existing non-shape sensing products in certain non-robotic medical fields. Two U.S. patents that we now license back from Intuitive cover the use of optical frequency domain reflectometry and multiple, closely spaced Bragg gratings for shape sensing, and the use of the inherent scatter as a strain sensor for shape sensing. These two patents expire in July 2025. We also license back from Intuitive patents and patent applications that cover certain refinements to the measurements covered in the foregoing two patents and related technologies, which are necessary in order to achieve the necessary accuracies for medical and other applications. These patent applications were filed in the United States, the European Patent Office, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and elsewhere. These patents and patent applications can support other nonmedical applications of our fiber optic shape sensing technology.
Coherent
    In December 2006, we entered into an asset transfer and license agreement with Coherent, Inc. Under the agreement, we acquired the rights to manufacture Coherent’s “Iolon” brand of swept tunable lasers as well as certain manufacturing equipment and inventory previously used by Coherent to manufacture the lasers. We continue to enhance, produce and market these lasers under our “Phoenix” brand. Under this agreement, Coherent granted non-exclusive licenses to us for certain U.S. patents and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Coherent for making, having made, using, importing, selling and offering for sale the lasers. This agreement expired in 2016. However, the patent licenses became fully paid and perpetual, as we fulfilled our royalty obligations during the 10-year period and the license to the other intellectual property rights is perpetual. These U.S. patents expire between 2020 and 2022. As consideration, we paid Coherent a total of $1.3 million in addition to paying royalties on net sales of products sold by us that incorporate the lasers or that are manufactured using the intellectual property covered by the licenses. 
The Phoenix laser is a miniaturized, external-cavity laser offering high performance in a compact footprint and is applicable to a range of fiber optic test and measurement, instrumentation, and sensing applications. These products employ frequency-tuned lasers to measure various aspects of the transmission properties of telecommunications fiber optic components and systems. Lasers are also used in fiber optic sensing applications such as distributed strain and temperature mapping, and distributed measurement of shape. We currently use these lasers within our ODiSI platform of products, our fiber optic shape sensing products and certain of our backscatter reflectometer products, and we also sell variations of the Phoenix laser as standalone products. Under our agreements related to our sale of assets to Intuitive, we have certain obligations to supply Intuitive with these lasers. 
Divestitures
Sale of High-Speed Optical Receiver ("HSOR") Business 
    On August 9, 2017, we completed the sale of our HSOR business, which was part of our Lightwave segment, to Macom Technology Solutions Inc. ("Macom") for an initial purchase price of $33.5 million, of which $29.5 million in cash has been received, and $4.0 million was placed into escrow until December 15, 2018 for possible working capital adjustments to the purchase price and potential satisfaction of certain post-closing indemnification obligations. The HSOR business was a 
component of the operations of Advanced Photonix, Inc., which we acquired in May 2015. In December 2018, we received $1.5 million of the escrow amount. In March 2020, we settled a dispute regarding the remaining $2.5 million in escrow resulting in us receiving $0.6 million and Macom receiving $1.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $1.4 million, net of income tax benefit, to reflect the settlement of the dispute. 
Sale of Luna Optoelectronics
    In July 2018 we sold substantially all of the assets associated with our custom optoelectronic components and sub-assemblies business for total cash consideration of $17.5 million, paid at closing, in addition to contingent consideration of up to $1.0 million. The contingent consideration is subject to the optoelectronic business achieving specified revenue targets for the 18-month period following the closing date. We did not receive any of the additional $1.0 million of consideration because the minimum revenue targets were not achieved. 
Corporate History
We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1990 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2003. We completed our initial public offering in June 2006. Our executive offices are located at 301 1st St SW, Suite 200, Roanoke, Virginia 24011 and our main telephone number is (540) 769-8400.
Competition
We compete with a variety of companies in several different product markets. The products that we have developed or are currently developing will compete with other technologically innovative products, as well as products incorporating conventional materials and technologies. We expect that we will compete with companies that manufacture test and measurement equipment for a wide range of industries, including aerospace, defense, healthcare, telecommunications, energy (including oil and gas and green energy), industrial measurement, and security applications. Although there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so, we believe that we compete favorably in these areas because our products leverage advanced technologies to offer superior performance. If we are unable to effectively compete in these areas in the future, we could lose business to our competitors, which could harm our operating results.
We also compete, or will compete, for government, university and corporate research contracts relating to a broad range of technologies. Competition for contract research is intense and the industry has few barriers to entry. We compete against a number of in-house research and development departments of major corporations, as well as a number of small, limited-service contract research providers and companies backed by large venture capital firms. The contract research industry continues to experience consolidation, which has resulted in greater competition for clients. Increased competition might lead to price and other forms of competition that could harm our operating results. We compete for contract research on the basis of a number of factors, including reliability, past performance, expertise and experience in specific areas, scope of service offerings, technological capabilities and price.
Government Regulation
Qualification for Small Business Innovation Research Grants
    SBIR is a highly competitive program that encourages small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides them with incentives to commercialize their technologies by funding research that might otherwise be prohibitively expensive or risky for companies like us. As noted above, we presently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this program, but we must continue to qualify for the SBIR program in order to be eligible to receive future SBIR awards. The eligibility requirements are:
•Ownership. The company must be more than 50 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, or owned by an entity that is itself more than 50 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens; and
•Size. The company, including its affiliates, cannot have more than 500 employees.
    These requirements are set forth in the SBA’s regulations and are interpreted by the SBA’s Office of Hearings and Appeals. In determining whether we satisfy the more than 50% ownership requirement, agreements to merge, stock options, convertible debt and other similar instruments are given “present effect” by the SBA as though the underlying security were actually issued unless the exercisability or conversion of such securities is speculative, remote or beyond the control of the security holder. We therefore believe our outstanding options and warrants held by eligible individuals may be counted as outstanding equity for purposes of meeting the more than 50% equity ownership requirement. We believe that we are in compliance with the SBA ownership requirements.
    In addition, to be eligible for SBIR contracts, the number of our employees, including those of any entities that are considered to be affiliated with us, cannot exceed 500. As of December 31, 2020, we, including all of our divisions, had 426 full- and part-time employees. In determining whether we have 500 or fewer employees, the SBA may count the number of employees of entities that are large stockholders who are “affiliated” or have the power to control us. In determining whether firms are affiliated, the SBA evaluates factors such as stock ownership and common management, but it ultimately may make its determination based on the totality of the circumstances. Eligibility protests can be raised to the SBA by a competitor or by the awarding contracting agency. If we grow larger, and if our ownership becomes more diversified, we may no longer qualify for the SBIR program, and we may be required to seek alternative sources and partnerships to fund some of our research and development costs. Additional information regarding these risks may be found below in “Risk Factors.”
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
    Our facilities and current and proposed activities involve the use of a broad range of materials that are considered hazardous under applicable laws and regulations. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other requirements relating to employee health and safety, protection of the environment, product labeling and product take back. Regulated activities include the storage, use, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or potentially hazardous materials and wastes. Our current and proposed activities also include potential exposure to physical hazards associated with work environment and equipment. We could incur costs, fines, civil and criminal penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims, or we could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or requirements. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits in a timely manner, human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental, health and safety laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could harm our business. Further, violations of present and future environmental, health and safety laws could restrict our ability to expand facilities and pursue certain technologies, as well as require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur potentially significant costs to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations and other requirements.
    We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety laws. We anticipate that we could incur additional capital and operating costs in the future to comply with existing environmental, health and safety laws and new requirements arising from new or amended statutes and regulations. In addition, because the applicable regulatory agencies have not yet promulgated final standards for some existing environmental, health and safety programs, we cannot at this time reasonably estimate the cost for compliance with these additional requirements. The amount of any such compliance costs could be material. We cannot predict the impact that future regulations will impose upon our business.
Employees
    As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 411 full-time employees and 15 part-time employees, including approximately 179 in research, development and engineering positions, approximately 140 in operations, approximately 56 in sales and marketing, and approximately 51 in administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Backlog 
    Our backlog of purchase orders received for which the related goods have not been shipped or recognized as revenue, primarily within our Lightwave segment, was $28.2 million and $16.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
    We have historically had a backlog of contracts, primarily within our Luna Labs segment, for which work has been scheduled, but for which a specified portion of work has not yet been completed. The approximate value of our backlog was $26.8 million and $31.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
    We define backlog as the dollar amount of obligations payable to us under negotiated contracts upon completion of a specified portion of work that has not yet been completed, exclusive of revenues previously recognized for work already performed under these contracts, if any. Total backlog includes funded backlog, which is the amount for which money has been directly authorized by the U.S. government or for which a purchase order has been received from a commercial customer, and unfunded backlog, which represents firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated. Unfunded backlog was $5.0 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Our backlog is subject to delays or program cancellations that may be beyond our control.
