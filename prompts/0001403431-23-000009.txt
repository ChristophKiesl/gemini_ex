ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview 
Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. (herein collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” "HCC" or “the Company”) provides full-service parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous bulk and containerized waste management, used oil collection, re-refining and lubricating base oil product sales, wastewater vacuum services, antifreeze collection, recycling and product sales, industrial and field services, and emergency and spill response services. We believe that we are the second largest provider of full-service parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous waste services and used oil collection services to customers in both the industrial and vehicle maintenance sectors in North America. We also believe that we are the second largest used oil re-refiner by capacity in North America, and the second largest producer of remanufactured antifreeze in the United States. We operate our business through our subsidiary, Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC. We operate our business through our Environmental Services and Oil Business segments. 
On August 3, 2022, we acquired Patriot Environmental Services, Inc. (“Patriot”), a leading provider of environmental services across the Western United States specializing in a wide variety of waste services, including emergency response, industrial services, and OSRO spill response. At the time of the acquisition, Patriot operated eighteen locations in the western United States, including two wastewater treatment facilities. More than 380 Patriot employees joined the Company as part of the acquisition. The Patriot business is included in our Environmental Services segment.
From our beginning as a parts cleaning and used oil collection service, we have expanded our range of environmental solutions and continue to build upon our strong foundation to protect the environment for a brighter sustainable future. We understand that the services we provide have an impact on the environment, people and the communities in which we operate. HCC is guided by our vision to protect the Earth’s resources by helping the business world run cleaner.
Environmental Services Segment
Our Environmental Services segment consists of our full-service parts cleaning, containerized waste management, wastewater vacuum, antifreeze recycling, emergency and spill response, and industrial and field services. These services allow our customers to outsource the handling of their used and regulated materials and related environmental needs. Many of the materials and waste we manage on behalf of our customers are subject to extensive and complex regulations, and mismanagement can result in citations, penalties, and substantial direct costs both to the service provider and to the generator. 
We allow our customers to focus more on their core business and devote fewer resources to industrial and hazardous waste management and its related administrative burdens. 
We have adopted innovative approaches in our Environmental Services segment to minimize the regulatory burdens for our customers and have made “ease of use” of our services and products a priority. Our company has pioneered a program whereby our customers' used parts cleaning solvent may be excluded from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") definition of hazardous waste. Our reuse program (referred to above) and our nonhazardous solvent program not only simplify the management of used solvent generated by our customers, but also reduce the total volume of hazardous waste generated at many of our customers’ locations. This can allow the customer to achieve a lower “generator status” with the EPA and thereby reduce their overall regulatory burden, including reduced reporting obligations and inspections. 
Our focus on providing ease of use for our customers is also embedded in the other offerings in our Environmental Services segment. As part of our containerized waste and wastewater vacuum programs, we assist our customers in identifying and characterizing their regulated wastes as well as providing the proper labeling and shipping documentation for their regulated materials. In certain portions of our service geography, we provide customers with in-house treatment of their regulated wastewater as part of our wastewater vacuum services and oily water collection programs. Our antifreeze recycling service offers our customers a fully-compliant method to safely manage their used antifreeze while providing a high quality, environmentally friendly, remanufactured product which allows them to further their sustainability goals. Similarly, through our industrial and field services as well as emergency spill response services, we bring properly trained personnel and required equipment to project sites along with overall project management which allows our customers to focus on their core business activities while we manage non-core activities such as lab packs, tank cleanings, and spill clean-up.
Oil Business Segment 
The Oil Business segment consists of used oil collection activities, re-refining activities, oil filter removal and disposal services, and the sale of recycled fuel oil. Through our re-refining process, we recycle used oil into high quality lubricating base oil and other products, and we are a supplier to firms that produce and market finished lubricants. This program allows our used oil collection customers to positively impact the environment by contributing to the reduction of the use of crude oil to produce lubricating base oil. Using crude oil to produce lubricating base oil has been found to be more energy intensive compared to manufacturing lubricating base oil from used oil. It also reduces greenhouse gas emissions when compared to burning used oil as fuel. We operate a used oil re-refinery with an annual nameplate output of lubricating base oil which has a nameplate capacity of 50 million gallons. We are currently feeding the re-refinery with a combination of used oil collected from our customers and used oil that we purchase from third parties. 
Industry
We operate within markets for industrial and hazardous waste services in the U.S. and a portion of Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we focus on the parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous bulk and containerized waste management, used oil collection, re-refining and base oil sales, wastewater vacuum services, antifreeze collection, recycling and product sales, industrial and field services, and emergency and spill response services markets for small to mid-sized establishments as well as larger businesses and governmental entities. These establishments have a need to remove contaminants (e.g., grease and dirt) from machine and engine parts and include manufacturers and businesses which involve vehicle maintenance (e.g., car dealerships, and trucking firms). These businesses typically generate various waste materials (e.g., used oil, waste paint, antifreeze) that generally cannot be legally discarded as municipal trash or poured down standard drains and they also need assistance with projects to clean tanks, dispose of expired chemicals (i.e., lab packs) and clean up periodic waste or material spills. 
Environmental Services Segment

Parts cleaning machines and the related cleaning chemicals and solutions are used by operators and maintenance personnel in industrial plants and technicians in vehicle maintenance locations to clean dirty machine parts. Through use, the cleaning chemicals and solutions become contaminated with oil, sediment or other contaminants and must be replaced regularly. This replacement of used cleaning chemicals and solutions is subject to environmental regulations prohibiting disposal with municipal trash or by pouring down drains. These same businesses generate other regulated materials (hazardous and non-hazardous wastes) which may not be legally disposed of in the municipal trash or poured down drains, such as used oil, waste paint, antifreeze, used oil filters, discarded fluorescent light tubes, spent batteries, etc. They also need assistance with projects to clean tanks, dispose of expired chemicals (i.e., lab packs) and clean up periodic waste or material spills. Because the management of these wastes is subject to changing regulatory requirements, most businesses look for assistance from companies such as HCC to provide the specialized knowledge to prepare required paperwork, maintain records, and ensure compliance with environmental laws. 
Oil Business Segment
Through our used oil collection services, we compete in the used oil collection market. Automotive shops generate used oil as a result of performing oil changes on passenger cars and trucks. Industrial plants also generate used oil, often as a result of changing lubricants used in heavy machinery. Environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of used oil into sewers or landfills, so most commercial generators arrange to have their used oil picked up periodically by a used oil collector. 
We process used oil at our re-refinery, producing high quality lubricating base oil. Most lubricating base oil is produced at refineries that process crude oil, and lubricating base oil is just one of the many products of the refining process along with gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, asphalt, and other hydrocarbon products. Major refining companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Motiva produce a significant share of the total U.S. base oil output. These refiners who produce base oil from crude oil, typically set the market price for base oil and re-refiners such as HCC, who produce base oil from used oil, are price takers. Some of the major refining companies use base oil to produce their own finished lubricant products and also sell some of their produced material to other firms that focus on the blending and packaging of lubricants. The market price of base oil is primarily driven by the market price of crude oil feedstock and the balance between the supply and demand for base oil. 
As of December 31, 2022, in addition to our re-refinery, we operated 17 oil processing operations. These locations typically remove excess water from the used oil and separate oil from oily water mixtures using thermal treatment, gravity separation, and mechanical filtration. The finished product from this process is called Recycled Fuel Oil ("RFO"). Most of the RFO we produce is sold to companies who burn the used oil for energy, use it as a blend or cutter stock or for other niche applications. From time-to-time we will also sell or swap our RFO with other used processors, who will use it to produce products such as Vacuum Gas Oil ("VGO") and re-refined base oil. We also operate 10 commercial wastewater treatment operations that service our Environmental Services segment. These facilities allow us to remove oil from wastewater, treat the wastewater, and then discharge it according to the standards in the applicable discharge permits. Some of the oil removed in the wastewater treatment process may become RFO or be used as a feedstock for our used oil re-refinery. 
The Crystal Clean Solution
Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. is headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and operates through 105 branch and industrial services locations serving approximately 104,000 customer locations. 
Environmental Services Segment
During the year ended December 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), we performed more than 679,000 environmental services. We believe that our Company is structured to meet the needs of vehicle maintenance businesses, medium sized manufacturers, and large governmental entities. We believe our services are highly attractive to our customers, who value features such as assistance in preparing waste manifests and drum labels, regularly-scheduled service visits to check inventories and remove accumulated waste, and minimizing the number of vendors they must deal with related to the management of these materials. As a result of our acquisition of Patriot, our expanded service menu allows us to better meet the environmental needs of both smaller and larger clients. Revenues in our Environmental Services segment accounted for 63% of our revenues for fiscal 2022.
Oil Business Segment

Through our used oil collection service, we collect the used oil generated by our customers when they replace used lubricating oil in vehicles and machinery. Most customers store the used oil they generate in tanks, which must be emptied regularly to mitigate the risk of overflow or termination of their oil change or maintenance activities. As a result, these customers have a strong need for timely used oil service. We have designed our services to deliver regularly-scheduled pickups, as well as the capability to respond to unscheduled requests on short notice. The used oil we collect is either transported to our used oil re-refinery or processed into RFO. When we re-refine or recycle used oil, we are able to provide our customers with the satisfaction that their used oil is re-refined into high quality lubricants, using the approach cited as preferred by the EPA. As the marketplace places a higher priority on environmental, social and governance issues, re-refining appears to be viewed as more valuable among used oil generators.
At our used oil re-refinery in Indianapolis, Indiana, we re-refine used oil collected from our customers, or purchased from other used oil collection service providers, into lubricating base oil that we sell to firms who then blend, package, and market finished lubricants. The nameplate capacity is 75 million gallons of annual input of used oil feedstock including the impact of periodic shutdowns to perform routine maintenance. In fiscal 2022, we collected approximately 75 million gallons of used oil from our customers. Revenues in our Oil Business segment accounted for 37% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022. 
Services

Across our range of services, we focus on reducing our customers' burdens associated with their generation of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Many of these wastes are subject to extensive and complex regulations, and mismanagement can result in citations, penalties, and substantial direct costs, both to the service provider and the generator. Many customers are familiar with “Superfund liability” and the possibility that they will be required to pay for future cleanups if their waste is mismanaged in a way that leads to environmental damage. Our services allow customers to focus more on their core business and devote fewer resources to industrial and hazardous waste management. 
Environmental Services Segment
In our full-service parts cleaning business, we provide customers with parts cleaning equipment and chemicals to remove oil, grease, and other contaminants from engine parts and machine parts. Most commonly, we provide a parts cleaning machine that contains either a petroleum or aqueous-based solvent in a reservoir. We provide various models of parts cleaning equipment which include both manual and automated cleaning. The solvent or cleaning solution can be reused until the contamination level is too high to allow for proper cleaning and requires replacement. We typically visit our customers every 4 to 12 weeks to remove the used solvent and replace it with clean solvent, while at the same time cleaning and inspecting the parts cleaning equipment to ensure that it is functioning properly and assisting our customers with relevant regulatory paperwork. We believe there are still many parts cleaning services performed in the U.S. which are structured as hazardous waste services, meaning that when the solvent has been used, it is managed as a regulated hazardous waste subject to numerous laws and regulatory filings. We reduce this burden for our customers by offering three alternative parts cleaning programs (our non-hazardous and reuse programs for mineral spirits parts cleaning and our aqueous parts cleaning program) that do not subject the customer to the same hazardous waste regulations. These lower-burden approaches help certain customers to achieve regulatory compliance while minimizing the paperwork and bureaucracy associated with hazardous waste management - ultimately saving them time and money. For example, these programs currently enable many of our customers to reduce their generation of hazardous wastes below the 220 pounds per month maximum threshold for retaining the Federal EPA generator status of Very Small Quantity Generator ("VSQG"). For most of our customers, maintaining a VSQG status provides significant savings associated with not having to maintain an EPA identification number; prepare, track, and file transportation manifests; or produce other reports related to the use, storage, and disposal of used solvents. We offer a wide variety of different models of parts cleaning machines from which our customers may choose the machine that best fits their specific parts cleaning needs. While the majority of our customers are provided or sold machines directly from us, we also offer parts cleaning services for customers who purchase their parts cleaning machines from other sources. We offer a variety of petroleum solvents and aqueous chemicals for use in parts cleaning machines. We also have a wide range of service schedules from weekly service visits to triannual service visits. 
In our containerized waste service, we collect drums, pails, boxes, and other containers of hazardous and non-hazardous waste materials from our customers. Typical wastes from vehicle maintenance include used antifreeze, used oil filters, waste paint, and used absorbent material. Typical wastes from manufacturing and industrial operations include waste paint and solvents, oily water wastes, used absorbents, discarded fluorescent lighting tubes and spent batteries. We endeavor to find the lowest burden regulatory approach for managing each of these materials for our clients. In some cases, we can develop lower burden alternatives based on recycling materials for component recovery, such as with oil filters, or by following the less onerous universal waste regulations, such as with fluorescent tubes, aerosol cans and waste paint. In other cases, the hazardous waste regulations may apply, in which case we assist customers with the hazardous waste disposal process, including performing analysis to characterize their waste, preparing manifests and drum labels, and selecting the appropriate destination facility. As part of our comprehensive service approach, we visit our customers periodically to check their inventory of used or waste materials and remove full containers as appropriate. Because there are statutory limits on the amount of time that customers can store these waste materials, these service visits are valuable to help customers stay in compliance. To the extent that we can coordinate these service visits together with a regularly scheduled parts cleaning service, we are able to perform both tasks during the same visit, with the same truck and service employee. For a growing portion of the non-hazardous waste we collect in our containerized waste program, we consolidate the waste from containers (e.g. drums, etc.) picked up from our customers into large rolloff boxes at one of our non-hazardous waste processing facilities. This consolidation process allows us to deliver waste material in bulk to the final treatment and disposal site at a lower cost than if we were to send the containers directly to the final disposal site. At these same facilities we also perform solidification activities through which non-hazardous liquid wastes are mixed with materials such as saw dust or other absorbent materials to create a solid waste which becomes less costly to dispose of at the final, third-party disposal site. For the remainder of the containerized waste we collect from customers, we ship the waste containers from our branch locations to one of our hub facilities and finally to a third party disposal vendor.
In a majority of our branch locations, we provide wastewater vacuum services for the removal of mixtures of oil, water, and sediment from wastewater pretreatment devices and other sources. Many shops and plants have floor drain systems that lead to pits, sumps, or separators that are designed to separate and retain oil and dirt, but allow clear water to flow out to a municipal sewer. Periodically, these drains and collection points accumulate excess oil or sediment needing removal. Because some of the material is very thick, a specialized vacuum is utilized for efficient removal of the material. Our wastewater vacuum service includes the removal of the oil, water, and sediment so that the customer's equipment operates as intended. We also offer bulk oily water removal. These services are scheduled on a regular basis. We currently offer vacuum service at 71 of our branches. We believe we have the opportunity to grow this business by adding vacuum service to most of our remaining branches. We operate ten commercial wastewater treatment facilities that allow us to remove oil from wastewater, treat the wastewater, and discharge it according to the standards of the applicable discharge permits. 
Through our antifreeze recycling service, we offer customers a legally-compliant method to safely manage their used antifreeze while providing a full line of high quality, environmentally friendly, remanufactured products. We offer responsive, on-time scheduled or on-demand collection and transportation of used antifreeze to our five antifreeze recycling facilities, where the waste antifreeze is recycled into high quality ethylene glycol or an ethylene glycol and water mixture. From there we add high quality inhibitors to produce a full line of virgin-quality antifreeze products. We then sell the remanufactured antifreeze products primarily to our vehicle maintenance customers. 
We also offer a variety of industrial and field services to assist customers with on-site equipment and tank cleaning as well as the removal and proper management of various types of waste. Typical projects include lab pack services, soil remediation services, the cleaning of above ground storage tanks, sumps, separators, ship-to-shore fluid transfers, and other environmental remediation services. In the western U.S. we typically use HCC employees to perform a majority of the work for our industrial and field services projects. In the remainder of the U.S. and eastern Canada we serve as a contractor and project manager while engaging subcontractors or outsourced labor, equipment, transportation and disposal when performing industrial and field services projects. 
Oil Business Segment
As of the end of fiscal 2022, we offered bulk used oil collection services in 86 of our branch locations. Although we manage some used oil through our containerized waste program, most customers who generate used oil (typically from vehicle engine oil changes) produce large quantities that are stored in bulk tanks. These volumes are handled more efficiently via bulk tank trucks, such as the type we utilize, where we pump the customer's material into our tank truck for proper handling. We transfer a majority of the used oil we collect to our re-refinery to be re-refined into lubricating base oil. From time-to-time we also engage in swaps of used oil with other re-refiners or used oil processors. We recycle the remaining used oil into RFO, some of which is sold to industrial burners, such as asphalt plants that use the RFO as a less expensive substitute for other fuels. We also sell RFO to be used in other niche applications (e.g. in the mining industry). As with our other services, we offer to visit customers on a regularly scheduled basis to arrange for the removal of their accumulated oil. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are the second largest provider of full-service parts cleaning services and used oil collection services in the U.S., the second largest producer of remanufactured antifreeze, and a leading provider of containerized waste services to small and medium sized customers. From our base of 105 branch and industrial services locations, we employ an organized and disciplined approach to increasing our market share by taking advantage of the following competitive strengths: 

Excellent Customer Service. Our business is built on the philosophy of providing a standardized, sales-oriented approach to our customers across our branch network. Our branch personnel are focused on local sales and service delivery, and a significant portion of their compensation is linked to revenue growth and new business development. In order to achieve this revenue growth, our personnel understand that they must retain existing business, which is best achieved by providing a high level of customer service which can lead to cross-selling opportunities and referrals to new prospects. 
Cost-Efficient Branch Rollout Model. Our branch model allows us to consolidate operational and administrative functions not critical to sales and service at a regional hub, treatment or processing facilities, or at our headquarters. This model has been the foundation for our new branch rollout as we have expanded from 14 branches in 1999, and we expect to extend this model to new locations. Furthermore, as we grow within each branch, we improve our route density, which is an important contribution to profitability in our business. 
Large Branch Network. We have spent over 20 years building and developing a large network of branches that has enabled us to rapidly grow our environmental services and used oil collection services efficiently and cost effectively. Our investments in this network help us to open new branches and cross sell products and services through existing branches. 

Large and Highly Diverse Customer Base. Our extensive service menu has enabled us to attract a variety of customers engaged in a wide range of industrial businesses (such as manufacturing, transportation and distribution) and vehicle service. This diversification helps insulate us from disruption caused by the possible loss of a single large account. Our customer base consists of over 104,000 active customer locations. In fiscal 2022, our largest single customer in our Environmental Services segment represented 0.4% of our consolidated revenues, and our largest ten customers represented approximately 3.2% of our consolidated revenues. In the Oil Business segment, for fiscal 2022, our largest single customer accounted for 5.6% of our consolidated revenues, and our largest ten customers represented 24.7% of our consolidated revenues.
Innovative Services that Reduce Customers' Regulatory Burdens. We have designed our service programs to meet the needs of our target customers. In particular, these customers desire to minimize their regulatory compliance burdens, and we have developed innovative methods to help our customers achieve this objective. For example, we have created parts-cleaning service programs which exempt our customers from certain hazardous waste regulations and filing requirements:
•Non-hazardous Program for Parts Cleaning. In our non-hazardous program for parts cleaning, we provide our customers with a solvent that is not included in the EPA's definition of hazardous waste due to its increased flashpoint, and we educate each participating customer to prevent harmful contaminants from being added to the solvent during use. Because of the reduced solvent flammability, as long as the customer does not add toxic or flammable contaminants during use, neither the clean solvent that we supply nor the resulting used solvent generated by customers participating in the program is classified as hazardous waste by the EPA, and as a result can be managed as non-hazardous waste. To participate in this program, our customers must provide certification that no hazardous wastes have been added to the parts cleaning solvent. After we collect the used solvent from customers participating in our non-hazardous program for parts cleaning, we recycle it via distillation for re-delivery to our parts cleaning customers. The recycling process removes oil, water, and other impurities, resulting in solvent suitable to be re-used by our customers for parts cleaning. At the same time, this process minimizes the burdensome hazardous waste regulations faced by our customers and allows us to minimize our virgin solvent purchases. Our solvent recycling system located in Indianapolis, Indiana is capable of recycling up to six million gallons per year of used solvent generated by customers participating in our non-hazardous program. This provides adequate capacity in excess of our current requirements.
•Product Reuse Program for Parts Cleaning. Rather than managing used solvent as a waste, used solvent generated by customers participating in our product reuse program for parts cleaning is sold as a direct substitute for virgin solvent that is otherwise used in the manufacturing process for asphalt roofing materials. Because the used solvent is destined for reuse, it is not deemed a waste, and therefore it is not subject to hazardous waste regulations. To enhance the marketing of these programs, in the past 20 plus years, we have voluntarily obtained concurrence letters from more than 30 state environmental agencies to validate this approach.
•Aqueous Program. In addition to our petroleum-based solvent, we offer a vast suite of proprietary aqueous-based parts cleaning solutions, including our patented aqueous parts cleaning equipment and patented filtration technology for water-based fluids, which we believe is the most comprehensive aqueous-based solutions offering in the industry. After our customer is finished using the solution, we remove the used solution and almost exclusively manage it as non-hazardous waste. Similar to the two solvent-based programs described above, our customers’ used cleaning material will not be included in the EPA’s definition of a hazardous waste, which helps reduce our customers’ regulatory burdens. In addition, our patented Aqua Filtration Unit provides our customers with an innovative method to remove contaminants from their water-based fluids.
OSRO Spill Response Certification.  In order to be compliant with federal and state regulations, certain businesses/operations are required to maintain contingency plans which, among other requirements, detail how they plan to deal with spills and other contingencies. One method of compliance is to reference in their contingency plans, third-party organizations qualified to assist them in cleaning up a spill should one occur. Through our acquisition of Patriot, we are now certified as an Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) in certain parts of the western U.S. In order to achieve and maintain the OSRO designation, a company must, on a recurring basis, provide evidence of having the equipment and properly trained employees available to respond to a spill event. The OSRO designation provides us a competitive advantage in winning spill response projects. 
Experienced Management Team. Our management team has substantial experience in the industry and possesses particular expertise in the small to mid-sized customer segment. As of December 31, 2022, our senior managers had on average over 26 years of industry experience and our middle managers have on average of approximately 20 years of industry experience.
Growth Strategies
We intend to grow by providing environmental solutions that meet the needs of our customers. We have several different strategies to accomplish this which include: 
Same-Branch Sales Growth. We seek to generate year-over-year growth in existing markets by obtaining new customers and by cross-selling multiple services to existing customers. Our sales and marketing strategy includes providing significant incentives to our field sales and service personnel to find and secure new business. These incentives include commission compensation for individuals and managers as well as prize awards and contests at the individual and team level. Our company culture is designed to consistently emphasize the importance of sales and service excellence and to build and maintain enthusiasm that supports continued sales success. Additionally, we intend to drive profitability by leveraging fixed costs against incremental sales growth at our existing branches. 

Expanded Service Offerings. Of our 105 branch and industrial service locations, all branches currently offer parts cleaning and containerized waste management services, 86 offer used oil collection services, and 71 offer wastewater vacuum services. As our business grows and we achieve sufficient market penetration, we have the opportunity to expand our used oil collection and wastewater vacuum services to each branch location. We currently offer in-house industrial and field services only in our 14 industrial service locations which are exclusively in the western U.S. We intend to expand our in-house industrial and field services offer to the central and eastern U.S. We also have other business programs (e.g., wastewater vacuum, antifreeze) in various stages of development which have the potential to be offered through our branch locations in the future. 
Geographic Expansion. We currently operate from 105 branch and industrial service locations that offer all or portions of our service menu to customers in the vast majority of the United States, the District of Columbia, and parts of Ontario, Canada. We have historically been able to install new branches at a relatively low cost, although installation of branches in the Western U.S. is relatively more costly. Within the contiguous United States, we believe that there are opportunities to open more branches and provide convenient local service to additional markets. Expansion opportunities include additional industrial service locations in the central and eastern U.S.
Selectively Pursue Acquisition Opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in identifying and integrating acquisition targets. We plan to continue to pursue additional acquisitions that fit within our business strategy. On August 3, 2022, we acquired Patriot Environmental Services, Inc. (“Patriot”), a leading provider of environmental services across the Western United States specializing in a wide variety of waste services, including emergency response, industrial services, and OSRO spill response. At the time of acquisition, Patriot operated eighteen locations in the western United States, including two wastewater treatment facilities. In addition, given the number of small competitors in our business, there are generally multiple acquisition opportunities available to us. In 2021, we completed three smaller acquisitions: Cole’s Services, Inc., which expanded our processing, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste in California, Raider Environmental Services of Florida, Inc., which expanded our network of wastewater processing, oil collection and non-hazardous waste solidification throughout the Southern United States; and Source Environmental, Inc., which has increased our penetration in the hazardous and non-hazardous waste business and has provided us with the opportunity to internalize the performance of certain field service activities in the western U.S. 

Sales and Marketing

In our traditional branch business, we promote a culture which emphasizes sales and service excellence and entrepreneurship, and our sales philosophy starts with the principle of “sales through service.” We assign a territory to each of our Sales & Service Representatives ("SSRs"), and require and encourage them to grow their business on their routes by delivering excellent service to existing customers. This helps our SSRs retain business, sell more services to satisfied customers, and obtain valued referrals to potential new customers. In addition to the efforts of our SSRs, we employ a branch manager at each of our branches, and we also employ branch sales managers at our branches, all of whom have dedicated sales territories and responsibilities. 
We also have a corporate accounts sales team dedicated to pursuing larger and geographically dispersed opportunities. In our industrial and field services business we employ managers who are both responsible for sales as well as the operation and execution of the projects and services sold to our customers.

Suppliers and Recycling/Disposal Facilities
To support our traditional branch business we purchase goods such as parts cleaning machines, solvent (petroleum naphtha mineral spirits), cleaning chemicals, bulk used oil, bulk antifreeze (ethylene glycol) and used antifreeze, and absorbent from a limited group of suppliers. In our industrial and field services business we utilize vendors who provide labor and equipment for the projects we sell and manage. We also have arrangements with various firms that can recycle, burn, or dispose of the waste materials we collect from customers and generate from our waste processing activities. These suppliers and disposal facilities are important to our business, and we have identified backup suppliers in the event that our current suppliers and disposal facilities cannot satisfy our supply or disposal needs. Heritage Environmental Services, an affiliate of The Heritage Group, Fred Fehsenfeld and the Fehsenfeld family trusts, which collectively beneficially owned 31.2% of our common stock as of December 31, 2022, operates one of the largest privately-owned hazardous waste treatment businesses in the U.S. We have used Heritage Environmental Services' hazardous waste services in the past, and it is likely that we will continue to have some level of use in the future. 
We operate 10 non-hazardous waste processing facilities. Most of these facilities contain a centralized wastewater treatment (CWT) operation. The CWT facilities allow us to remove oil from wastewater, treat the wastewater, and then discharge it according to the standards in the applicable discharge permits. These facilities allow us the flexibility to dispose of our oily water and wastewater vacuum services wastewater collected from customers in certain branch territories internally as well as accepting wastewater from our customers directly at most of these facilities. Some of our non-hazardous waste processing facilities also consolidate and/or solidify non-hazardous solid, semi-solid, and liquid waste streams. These wastes are shipped to these sites from our branch network or the waste may be shipped directly from our customers to these sites.
Competition

The markets for parts cleaning, containerized waste management, used oil collection, wastewater vacuum services, antifreeze recycling, industrial and field services, and emergency and spill response services in which we participate are intensely competitive. While numerous small companies provide these services, our largest competitor, Safety-Kleen (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc.), has held material market share in all of the markets in which we operate. We believe that Safety-Kleen has greater financial and other resources and greater name recognition than us. We estimate that in the full-service portion of the parts cleaning market, Safety-Kleen is significantly larger than us, and that we are substantially larger than the next largest competitor. 

Many of our smaller competitors tend to be regional firms that operate in a single city. Although many of these smaller competitors lack the resources to offer clients a comprehensive menu of services, they generally offer a primary line of business, such as used oil collection, and offer other services on a secondary or tertiary basis in order to present a more complete menu to customers. In addition, companies involved in the waste management industry, including waste hauling, separation, recovery, and recycling, may have the expertise, access to customers, and financial resources that would encourage them to develop and market services and products competitive with those offered by us. We also face competition from alternative services that provide similar benefits to our customers as those provided by us. 

Price, service quality and timeliness, breadth of service offering, reputation, financial strength, and compliance history are the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete. While we feel that most market competitors compete primarily on price, we believe that our competitive strength comes from our focus on customer service and our broad menu of services. Although we employ a pricing structure that controls discounts, we are able to deliver a sound value proposition through the reduced regulatory burden achieved through our programs. We could lose a significant number of customers if Safety-Kleen or other competitors materially lower their prices, improve service quality, develop more competitive product and service offerings, or offer a non-hazardous, reuse or aqueous program for parts cleaning more appealing to customers than ours.
We have the second largest used oil re-refinery, by capacity, in North America. We believe that our largest competitor, Safety-Kleen, currently controls a majority of the used oil re-refining capacity in North America. 
Seasonality
Our operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather cycles influencing the timing of customers' needs for products and services. Typically during the first quarter and the end of the fourth quarter of each year there is less demand for most of our products and services due to the lower levels of activities by our customers as a result of the cold weather, particularly in the Northern and Midwestern regions of the United States. This lower level of activity also results in lower volumes of used oil generated for collection by us in the first quarter. In the winter months there is less construction activity, which reduces demand for certain re-refinery products. In addition, factory closings for the year-end holidays reduce the volume of industrial waste generated, which results in lower volumes of waste handled by us during the first quarter of the following year. From an industrial and field services perspective, our customers may delay initiating projects near the end of the year until they have more budgeted dollars available at the beginning of a new calendar year. The opposite is occasionally true, if a customer has dollars remaining in their budget near the end of the year, they may be more compelled to spend these dollars before the year ends. However, we generally experience the opposite seasonality impact (higher levels of activity in the first quarter and end of the fourth quarter) in our antifreeze business.
Information Technology 
We believe that automation and technology can enhance customer convenience, lower labor costs, improve cash management, and increase overall profitability. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to develop and or implement technologies that can improve our sales and service processes. Our commitment to the application of technology has resulted in the creation of a custom web-based application for scheduling, tracking, and management of customer services, billing, and collections for our traditional branch business. We believe that our standardized processes and controls enhance our ability to successfully add new branches and expand our operations into new markets. Mobile devices are used by our traditional branch-based employees in the field to access customer service information, capture substantially all service transactions and certain inventory movements. Statistics are gathered and reported on a daily and weekly basis. These capabilities provide timely, automated data measurement and control for service activities to accelerate response to market and operational change.
While we currently use primarily office automation tools to record service activity and generate related reports for our industrial services business, we are exploring the use of an electronic system to automate the current process. We plan to implement this new system for our industrial and field services business by the beginning of fiscal 2024.
Employees and Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,793 full time and 55 part time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
We believe one of the strengths of our company lies in the ability of our people to continually drive an employee-empowered culture dedicated to providing premier, environmentally-sustainable solutions to our customers. The success of our business, in part, is fundamentally connected to the safety of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to ensuring that our 
service representatives and all of our other field-based employees are properly trained to fulfill the responsibilities they're assigned. Our service representatives are the face of the business to our customers and as such we work to ensure they are properly trained through both online and hands-on training programs. In addition, our Behavioral Based Safety and “Own Your Safety” programs have provided a method to ensure constant identification of potential workplace hazards and helped us create a culture focused on educating, engaging and empowering employees to become champions of safety. 
In January 2020, we established a centralized training program, initially bringing new associates to the corporate headquarters with the goal of increasing the quality and consistency of all aspects of training (not just safety) for our field personnel. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this training was conducted virtually for most of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. At the end of fiscal 2022, we took steps to formalize a field-based training program for our field personnel and have resumed more formal onsite training for our field-based employees, both service employees and managers. We believe that prioritizing the safety of our employees and customers allows us to maintain our competitive advantage.
We are committed to be a diverse and inclusive workplace. All of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote ethical and respectful behavior based on our code of conduct, and we require every employee to routinely complete behavioral training to prevent, identify, and report any unethical or unlawful discrimination.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined to be in the best interest of our employees, customers and the extended communities where we operate, while also complying with the related government regulations. This includes having our employees work from home when possible. We also implemented additional safety measures for our essential employees whether they are at our customers' locations or working at a company location.
Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property as important to our success and we rely on trademark, copyright, and other intellectual property laws in the United States to protect our proprietary rights. We have, in the past, successfully defended our patents against infringement, and we intend to continue to defend our intellectual property rights. In addition, we seek to protect our proprietary rights through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, advisors, and others.
Our intellectual property includes the Crystal Clean brand and logo as well as our patented aqueous parts cleaning equipment, chemistry formulae, and filtration technology. If the Company exercises all of the extensions available via the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its existing patents, the patents will expire at various times between 2023 and 2025. Although we do not regard any single trade secret or component of our proprietary know-how to be material to our operations as a whole, if one or more of our competitors were to use or independently develop such know-how or trade secrets, our market share, sales volumes and profit margins could be adversely affected.
Regulation

Substantially all of our services and products involve the collection, transportation, storage, recycling and/or disposal of industrial and hazardous waste or hazardous materials, including solvents used in parts cleaners; containerized waste including waste paint, inks, adhesives, used antifreeze, used oil, and used oil filters; and bulk waste including used oil, oily water, and antifreeze. Our services are highly regulated by various governmental agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, as described in more detail below. Regulations govern matters such as the disposal of residual chemical wastes, operating procedures, storm water and wastewater discharges, fire protection, worker and community right-to-know, and emergency response plans. 
Our services and products require us to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain federal, state, and local environmental permits or approvals for some of our operations. Some of these permits must be renewed periodically, and governmental authorities have the ability to revoke, deny, or modify these permits. Zoning and land use restrictions also apply to all of our facilities. Siting and other state-operating approvals also apply in some states. 

We are subject to federal and state regulations governing hazardous and solid wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage, and disposal. Under RCRA, the EPA has established comprehensive “cradle-to-grave” regulations for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous or solid waste. The regulations impose technical and operating requirements that must be met by facilities that generate, store, treat, transport, and dispose of these wastes. A number of states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous and solid waste facilities. In addition, some 
states classify some wastes as hazardous that are not regulated under RCRA. Accordingly, we must comply with the state requirements for handling state regulated wastes. 
On June 30th, 2018 the EPA implemented an e-Manifest system for the capture of manifest documents electronically. This functionality included electronic manifests, scanned image upload, scanned image plus document data, and mailing of physical manifests to the EPA for processing. The EPA assesses a different fee depending on which of the above approaches is used. Increased fee rates went into effect October 1st, 2019. In 2020, Heritage-Crystal Clean began submitting manifests it terminates to the EPA electronically by way of data and image upload. This change resulted in lower fees assessed by the EPA. This fee was reduced by the EPA in October of 2021. These reduced fees have been passed on to customers.
Disposal partners utilized by the Company are at various stages of implementation of the available features, with partners passing on their costs incurred to the Company. The Company intends to continue to pass along the direct costs imposed by the EPA, or indirectly from disposal partners, to its customers. To the extent partners and the Company are able to implement costs saving measures provided by e-Manifesting, the Company expects that the regulatory costs that are currently passed on to customers could be reduced. 
Our branch and distribution hub operations are governed by 10-day transfer requirements and do not typically require a hazardous waste facility permit. Under RCRA, states are delegated to implement the regulatory programs through state regulations, and we obtain appropriate permits in those states with regulations more stringent than the federal EPA.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") governs the cleanup of inactive hazardous waste sites and imposes liability for the cleanup on “responsible parties” generating or transporting waste to a site. CERCLA further provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. CERCLA imposes strict liability on current or former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment as well as on businesses that generate those substances or transport them to the facilities. Responsible parties may be liable for substantial investigation and cleanup costs even if they operated their businesses properly and complied with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several. Certain of our customers' and third-party contractors' facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the operators of these facilities may have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes or other hazardous substances. Environmental liabilities could therefore exist under CERCLA, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or off-site locations where materials from our operations were disposed. In the past, we have been involved as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at CERCLA cleanup sites, and it is possible that we may be involved at similar cleanup sites in the future.
In addition to regulations under RCRA and CERCLA, the EPA has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act ("CAA") and the Clean Water Act ("CWA"). The CAA regulates emissions of pollutants into the air from mobile and stationary sources. CAA permits limit the emissions from parts cleaning units. One of our distribution hubs, our used oil re-refinery, and several of our oily water treatment operations are subject to facility-based permits under the CAA. The used oil re-refinery was constructed and is operating under CAA New Source Performance Standards and an associated permit. This air permit was modified to accommodate the expansion of the re-refinery. Our transportation fleet of trucks is regulated for emissions as mobile sources. Regulations under the CWA govern the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers and require discharge permits and sampling and monitoring requirements. The CWA also requires specific spill plans governing the storage of waste and product hydrocarbons. A more detailed spill plan is also required at the used oil re-refinery because of the large volume of certain storage tanks. All of our recycling, used oil and oily water processing facilities currently hold CWA National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits for stormwater runoff and water pollution prevention. Our operations are also regulated pursuant to state statutes and implementing regulations, including those addressing clean water and clean air. 

Our transportation fleet, truck drivers, and the transportation of hazardous materials are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") Motor Carrier and the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass. Governmental regulations apply to the vehicles used by us to transport the chemicals we distribute to customers and the waste and other residuals collected from customers. These vehicle requirements include the licensing requirements for the vehicles and the drivers, vehicle safety requirements, vehicle weight limitations, shipping papers, and vehicle placarding requirements. 
The Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration ("OSHA") safety standards are applicable to all of our operations. The used oil re-refinery and mineral spirits distillation facility are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management standards that govern the operation of the facilities.

In August 1997, the South Coast Air Quality Management District in California (the “SCAQMD”), enacted Rule 1171, which prohibits the use of certain types of solvents that we currently use in our parts cleaning services. In the areas of California affected by this or similar regulations (including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento), aqueous parts cleaning is the primary substitute. We currently have four branches located in California, one in Bakersfield, Los Angeles, Fresno and Oakland.
 In November 2019, the State of New York Department of Environmental Conservation revised 6 NYCRR Part 226. This revision lowers the limits for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used in cleaning operations. This revision was originally to be effective after December 1, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective date for the aforementioned revision was delayed until December 1, 2021, Based on this revision, we are no longer able to use either of our two standard solvents currently used in our parts cleaning services offered in the State of New York. Our primary substitute for customers in the State of New York will be our aqueous parts cleaning offer. We currently have four branches located in the State of New York (Albany, Buffalo, Long Island and Rochester). 
In 2021 the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) revised its regulations related to solvent cleaning processes and industrial cleaning solvents [7 DE Administrative Code 1124 Control of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emissions section 33 - Solvent Cleaning and Drying]. The revision reduced the allowable limit of VOCs on certain cleaning products and established other requirements concerning the use of cleaning products and processes that emit VOCs. The deadline for users of cleaning solvents to comply with this revised regulation was August 11, 2022. As with similar regulatory changes in other jurisdictions, our primary substitute for customers in Delaware will be our aqueous parts cleaning offer. While we service Delaware customers from outside the state, we currently do not have any branches in the State of Delaware.
We cannot predict if or when other state and/or local governments will promulgate similar regulations which may restrict or prevent the use of solvent for parts cleaning. Pending air regulation laws in the northeastern United States may restrict, or possibly eliminate, the use of our typical parts washer solvent in cold parts cleaners. Due to the size of the states in the northeastern U.S. and the transport of pollutants over state boundaries, the Ozone Transport Commission ("OTC") develops overarching air pollution programs for member states to adopt. While there has been some delay in implementation of the regulations throughout the northeastern OTC states, additional regulations limiting the use of certain solvents and other ozone forming chemicals are expected to begin going into effect within the next few years. The OTC states include twelve states in the far northeastern U.S. as well as the District of Columbia. Among the OTC states, Maryland and Delaware have initiated development of rules to limit the use of ozone pollution forming compounds. 
More specifically to our traditional parts cleaning services, federal and state laws and regulations dictate and restrict to varying degrees what types of cleaning solvents may be used, how a solvent may be stored, and the manner in which contaminated or used solvents may be handled, transported, disposed of, or recycled. These legal and regulatory mandates have been instrumental in shaping the parts cleaning industry. We have developed methods of managing solvent as non-hazardous so as to significantly reduce the regulatory burden on us and on our customers. Any changes to, relaxation of, or repeal of federal or state laws and regulations affecting the parts cleaning industry may significantly affect the demand for our products as well as our competitive position in the market. 

The EPA has promulgated regulations that govern the management of used oils. Although used oil is not classified as a hazardous waste under federal law, certain states do regulate used oil as state-regulated waste. Our used oil collection services require compliance with both federal and state regulations. As with our parts cleaning services, we make use of various programs to reduce the administrative burden associated with our customers' compliance with used oil regulations. Any used oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") is regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"). The rules set minimum requirements for storage, treatment, and disposal of PCB wastes. Used oil contaminated with a certain level of PCBs may require incineration or special TSCA authorization or permits. 
One of the products of the re-refining process is Vacuum Tower Asphalt Extender ("VTAE"). VTAE is sold for use as an ingredient in asphalt used in the construction of roadways and other applications. State Departments of Transportation may regulate the characteristics of materials that are used as ingredients in roadway asphalt. A number of states have banned the use of VTAE as an ingredient in asphalt used on roadways. We believe, when used in the proper proportion, the VTAE produced at our re-refinery can be used in a paving asphalt formulation that meets all relevant performance standards. Regulatory restrictions on the use of VTAE have negatively impacted the marketability of this product and the profitability of our oil business. 
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these and other regulations, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties. Private individuals may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance with certain governmental requirements.
