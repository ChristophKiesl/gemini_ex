ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview of Our Business
 
VitaSpring Biomedical Co. Ltd., formerly Shemn Corp., was incorporated in Nevada on September 6, 2016. We are a start-up business company. We have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle since 2019. A change of 100% of Company’s ownership occurred effectively on January 21, 2020. As a result, we changed Company name from Shemn Corp. to VitaSpring Biomedical Co. Ltd. on February 17, 2020.
 
VitaSpring Biomedical Co., Ltd aims to build a cell medical industry, invest in research and development of stem cell applications in regenerative medicine, establish advanced medical research centers and high standard cell production centers, and provide “GTP” standard stem cell preparations for the development of cellular drugs.
 For future business development and medical applications, VitaSpring cooperates with affiliated companies to support the mass production and commercialization of X.msc-related medical projects. Some X.msc-based projects are researches and trials of Investment New Drugs and part of them are related to X.exosome, the critical material in the related skincare products. VitaSpring management also expect X.msc-related medical projects to implement in hospitals from a small scale in the future five years.
 
Recent Developments
 
On March 30, 2020, VitaSpring filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada effecting a name change of the Company to VitaSpring Biomedical Co. Ltd. (the "Corporate Action"). The Corporate Action and the Amended Articles became effective on April 21, 2020, following compliance with notification requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
 
Under new management, VitaSpring has completed the transition from patent technology into the know-how in the mass-production process of the purifying and culturing technology in the allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell production from the maternal-part placenta. The subject know-how can effectively and steadily culture more than 20 generations of sub-culture cells, which maintain the same level of activity index and contain the magnification of one thousand exosomes than other MSCs in terms of per ml. Accordingly, VitaSpring is able to build stem cell bank regulated by US FDA to provide the ready-to-use allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell for the emergent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the cost the patient can afford.
 
VitaSpring’s research team has been awarded the 16th, 17 th, 18 th Taiwan National Innovation Award certificates in 2019, 2020, and 2021 and joined the regenerative medicine flagships of the Ministry of Science and Technology from 2007 to 2020, including research projects for the mechanism of human placenta mesenchymal stem cells in different diseases. It highlights the technological foundation for the future clinical application of X.msc.
 

Business Plan
 
Through the development of cell medicine, we became a leading international business group in the fields of regenerative medicine applied to the innovative fields of medicine, preventive health care, beauty, and anti-aging. We do not sell products in a form for use by consumers although we may, in the future, develop products for use by consumers.
 
We have many unique advantages elevating us to be the best in the industry:
 1. Discovery and successful isolation of special mesenchymal stem cells (X.msc)
 2. Unlike typical MSCs, X.msc do not promote cancer and tumor growth, and is safe to use for the entire body
 3. Homogeneous purification technology
 4. Viability of X.msc is 1000 time that of the competitor
 5. Able to proliferate and maintain stemness of stem cells to 25+ generations
 6. Exclusive composition formula of culture medium
 7. The exclusive formula of exosomes have a variety of applications
 8. Extensive uses of X.msc
 9. Immunomodulation and anti-inflammation effect
 10. No ethical issues
