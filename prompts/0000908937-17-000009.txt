ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K presents information for Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (“Holdings”).  The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and “our company” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to Sirius XM Radio Inc. (“Sirius XM”) and its subsidiaries.
Sirius XM Holdings Inc.
Sirius XM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.  Holdings was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 21, 2013.  Holdings has no operations independent of its subsidiary Sirius XM.
Relationship with Liberty Media
As of December 31, 2016, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 67% of the outstanding shares of Holdings’ common stock.  Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.
Sirius XM Radio Inc.
We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our two proprietary satellite radio systems.  Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus features such as SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM, over our Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.  We are also a leader in providing connected vehicle services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 31.3 million subscribers.  Our subscribers include:

• | subscribers under our regular and discounted pricing plans;


• | subscribers that have prepaid, including payments made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle;


• | subscribers to our Internet services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and


• | certain subscribers to our weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions.

Our primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing to annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly plans.  We offer discounts for prepaid longer term subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount.  We also derive revenue from activation and other fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as our weather, traffic and data services.
Our satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers; retail stores nationwide; and through our website.  We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles.  We also acquire subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously-owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to our services. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.
Programming
We offer a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:

• | an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical;


• | live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges;


• | a multitude of talk and entertainment channels for a variety of audiences;


• | a wide range of national, international and financial news; and

2


• | exclusive limited run channels.

Our diverse spectrum of programming, including our lineup of exclusive material, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers.  We make changes to our programming lineup from time to time as we strive to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to our existing subscribers.  The channel line-ups for our services are available at siriusxm.com.
Internet Radio Service
We stream select music and non-music channels over the Internet.  Our Internet radio service also includes certain channels and features that are not available on our satellite radio service.  Access to our Internet radio service is offered to subscribers for a fee.  We also offer applications to allow consumers to access our Internet radio service on smartphones, tablets, computers, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.
SiriusXM Internet Radio offers listeners enhanced programming discovery and the ability to connect with content currently playing across our commercial-free music, sports, comedy, news, talk and entertainment channels or available through SiriusXM On Demand.
SiriusXM On Demand offers our Internet radio subscribers listening on our online media player and on smartphones the ability to choose their favorite episodes from a catalog of content whenever they want.  MySXM permits subscribers to personalize our existing commercial-free music and comedy channels to create a more tailored listening experience.  Channel-specific sliders allow users to create over 100 variations of each of more than 50 channels by adjusting characteristics like library depth, familiarity, music style, tempo, region, and multiple other channel-specific attributes.  SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM are offered to our Internet radio subscribers at no extra charge.
360L
We are developing a product, which we call “360L” (formerly called SXM17), that combines our satellite and Internet services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. 360L is expected to allow us to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems.  360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage of our satellite infrastructure and low delivery costs with the two-way communication capability of wireless Internet service to provide consumers seamless access to our content, including our live channels, SiriusXM On Demand programming and more personalized music services.  The wireless Internet connection included in 360L will enable enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of our content in the vehicle easier than ever.  360L will also allow consumers to manage aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles’ equipment.
Distribution of Radios
Automakers
We distribute satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles.  We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles.  Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States.
Most automakers include a subscription to our radio service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles.  In certain cases, we receive subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of our service.  We share with certain automakers a portion of the revenues we derive from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive our service.  We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
Previously Owned Vehicles
We acquire subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios.  We have entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs.  We also work directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified vehicles.
We have developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote our services to these potential subscribers.
3

Retail
We sell satellite radios directly to consumers through our website.  Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national and regional retailers.
Our Satellite Radio Systems
Our satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions.  We continually monitor our infrastructure and regularly evaluate improvements in technology.
Our satellite radio systems have three principal components:

• | satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities;


• | studios; and


• | radios.

Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
Satellites.  We provide our service through a fleet of five orbiting satellites, two in the Sirius system, FM-5 and FM-6, and three in the XM system, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5.  Our XM-5 satellite serves as a spare for both the XM and Sirius systems.
Our satellite constellation operates in geostationary orbits. During 2016, we transitioned the Sirius network to a geostationary orbit system using our FM-5 and FM-6 satellites. As part of this service transition, in 2016, our FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3 satellites, which had operated in highly inclined elliptical orbits, were moved into disposal orbits. In 2016, we also entered into an agreement for the design and construction of two new satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, which we plan to launch into geostationary orbits in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as replacements for XM-3 and XM-4.
Satellite Insurance.  We do not have in-orbit insurance policies covering our satellites, as we consider the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
Terrestrial Repeaters.  In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected.  In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems our service may experience interference. In many of these areas, we have deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance our signal coverage.  We operate over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the United States as part of our systems.
Other Satellite Facilities.  We control and communicate with our satellites from facilities in North America. During 2016, we maintained earth stations in Panama and Ecuador to control and communicate with three of our Sirius satellites, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3. We plan to end operations in Panama and Ecuador in 2017. Our satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
Studios
Our programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington D.C. and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of smaller venues across the country.  Our corporate headquarters is based in New York City.  Both our New York City and Washington D.C. offices house facilities for programming origination, programming personnel and facilities to transmit programming.
Radios
We do not manufacture radios.  We have authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and have licensed our technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands.  We do manage various aspects of the production of satellite radios.  To facilitate the sale of radios, we may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.

Connected Vehicle Services
We are a leader in providing connected vehicle services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.  We offer a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicles diagnostics, and stolen or parked vehicle locator services.  Our connected vehicle business provides services to several automakers, including Acura, Audi, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota.
Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
Canada
We own approximately 37% of the equity of Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. (“Sirius XM Canada”), the satellite radio provider in Canada.  Subscribers to the services offered by Sirius XM Canada are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
On May 12, 2016, our subsidiary, Sirius XM, entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Sirius XM Canada. Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Sirius XM and certain Canadian shareholders will form a new company to acquire shares of Sirius XM Canada not already owned by them pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, Sirius XM Canada’s shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive, for each share of Sirius XM Canada held, C$4.50 (U.S. $3.50 as of May 12, 2016) in (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock, (iii) a security exchangeable for shares of our common stock, or (iv) a combination thereof; provided that no more than 50% of the total consideration in the Transaction (or up to 35 million shares) will be issued in our common stock and exchangeable shares. All of the obligations of Sirius XM under the Arrangement Agreement are guaranteed by Holdings.
Following the Transaction, Sirius XM is expected to hold a 70% economic interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of the voting power and economic interest held by Slaight Communications and Obelysk Media, two of Sirius XM Canada’s current Canadian shareholders. Sirius XM expects to contribute to Sirius XM Canada approximately U.S. $275 million in connection with the Transaction (assuming that all shareholders elect to receive cash in connection with the Transaction), which amount is expected to be used to pay the cash consideration to Sirius XM Canada’s shareholders and will be decreased proportionately if shareholders elect to receive consideration in shares of our common stock or securities exchangeable for our common stock.
The Transaction has been approved by the stockholders of Sirius XM Canada and has received the required court approval. The Transaction remains subject to receipt of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission approval. Pending receipt of this approval, the Transaction is expected to close early in the the second quarter of 2017.
Other Services
Commercial Accounts.  Our programming is available for commercial establishments.  Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from us. Certain commercial subscribers are included in our subscriber count.
Satellite Television Service.  Certain of our music channels are offered as part of certain programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service.  Subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in our subscriber count.
Subscribers to the following services are not included in our subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to our services:
Travel Link.  We offer Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings.
Real-Time Traffic Services.  We offer services that provide graphic information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems.
5

Real-Time Weather Services.  We offer several real-time weather services designed for improving situational awareness in vehicle, marine and/or aviation use.
Competition
Satellite Radio
We face significant competition for both listeners and advertisers in our satellite radio business, including from providers of radio or other audio services.  Our digital competitors are making in-roads into vehicles, where we are currently the leading alternative to traditional AM/FM radio.
Traditional AM/FM Radio.  Our services compete with traditional AM/FM radio.  Several traditional radio companies are substantial entities owning large numbers of radio stations or other media properties.  The radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive.  Traditional AM/FM broadcasters are also aggressively pursuing Internet radio, wireless Internet-based distribution arrangements and data services.
Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees.  Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports.  The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio reduces the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for our subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what we can charge for our services.
Internet-Based Competitors.  Internet radio services often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world.  Major online providers, including Amazon, Apple, Google Play, Pandora, Spotify and iHeartRadio, make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription.  Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content.  These services compete directly with our services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. 
Advanced In-Dash Infotainment Systems.  Nearly all automakers have deployed or are planning to deploy integrated multimedia systems in dashboards, including in many cases Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and products from Apple and Google.  These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications such as restaurant bookings, movie show times and financial information.  Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition.  These systems enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in the car.
Direct Broadcast Satellite and Cable Audio.  A number of providers offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems.  These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home.  The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service.
Other Digital Media Services.  The audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with our services now or that could compete with those services in the future.
Traffic Services
A number of providers compete with our traffic services.  In-dash navigation is threatened by smartphones that provide data services through a direct vehicle interface.  Most of these smartphones offer GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn-by-turn navigation.
Connected Vehicle Services
Our connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, including Verizon Telematics.  OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles.  We also compete with wireless devices such as mobile phones and, to a lesser extent, with systems developed internally by automakers.  We compete against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the 
6

basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and systems customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
Government Regulation
As operators of a privately-owned satellite system, we are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

• | the licensing of our satellite systems;


• | preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and


• | compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.

Any assignment or transfer of control of our FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC.  The FCC's order approving the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 (the “Merger”) requires us to comply with certain voluntary commitments we made as part of the FCC Merger proceeding.  We believe we comply with those commitments.
In 1997, we were the winning bidders for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services.  Our FCC licenses for our Sirius satellites expire in 2022 and 2025.  Our FCC licenses for our XM satellites expire in 2018, 2021 and 2022.  We anticipate that, absent significant misconduct on our part, the FCC will renew our licenses to permit operation of our satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
In some areas, we have installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement our satellite signal coverage.  The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted us a license through 2027 to operate our repeater network.
In certain cases, we obtain FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators.  We believe our radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
We are required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the United States government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to our satellites and their operations.  The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the United States or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting our services could adversely affect our ability to retain our FCC licenses or the manner in which we operate.
Copyrights to Programming
In connection with our satellite radio music programming, we must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders:  Holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work).
Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”) and SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”).  The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”), have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders.  We have arrangements with all of these organizations.  The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on us, including increasing our costs or limiting the musical works available to us.
Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists.  Under the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, or if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) of the Library of Congress.
7

The CRB has issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over our satellite digital audio radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period ending on December 31, 2017.  Under the terms of the CRB's existing decision, we will pay a royalty based on gross revenues, subject to certain exclusions, of 11% for 2017.  The rate for 2016 was 10.5%. A proceeding is underway before the CRB to determine the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over our satellite digital audio radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period ending on December 31, 2022.
The revenue currently subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers and advertising revenue from channels, other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings.  Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things, revenue from channels, programming and products or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels make only incidental performances of sound recordings; revenue from equipment sales; revenue from current and future data services (including video and connected vehicle services) offered for a separate charge; intellectual property royalties received by us; credit card, invoice and fulfillment service fees; and bad debt expense.  The regulations also allow us to further reduce our monthly royalty fee in proportion to the percentage of our performances that feature pre-1972 recordings (which are not subject to federal copyright protection) as well as those that are licensed directly from the copyright holder, rather than through the statutory license.
To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, including to mobile devices, we also must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners of musical compositions and sound recordings.  We have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC, BMI and GMR to license the musical compositions we stream over the Internet.  The licensing of certain sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 for use on the Internet is also subject to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 on terms established by the CRB.  In 2016, we paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings on the Internet of $0.0022.  In accordance with the CRB's 2016 decision, this royalty rate is expected to increase during the period 2018 through 2020 based on the consumer price index.
Our rights to perform certain copyrighted sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work) that were fixed after February 15, 1972 are governed by United States federal law, the Copyright Act.  In contrast, our rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 are governed by state law.
Trademarks
We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” and “SXM” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services we offer. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use the “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” or “SXM” trademarks in the United States.  We also have registered, and intend to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of our channels.  We have also registered the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM” and “SiriusXM” in Canada. We have granted a license to use certain of our trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada.
Personnel
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,402 full-time employees.  In addition, we rely upon a number of part-time employees, consultants, other advisors and outsourced relationships. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Corporate Information and Available Information
Our executive offices are located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 11th floor, New York, New York 10104 and our telephone number is (212) 584-5100.  Our internet address is www.siriusxm.com.
