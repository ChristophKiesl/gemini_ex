Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we”, “our”, “us”, “our Company”, “the Company”, and “Michaels” mean The Michaels Companies, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.
​
General
​
Michaels Stores, Inc. (“MSI”) is headquartered in Irving, Texas and was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1983. In July 2013, MSI was reorganized into a holding company structure and The Michaels Companies, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware in connection with the reorganization. 
​
With $5,072.0 million in sales in fiscal 2019, the Company is the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America (based on store count) providing materials, project ideas and education for creative activities. Our mission is to inspire and enable customer creativity, create a fun and rewarding place to work, foster meaningful connections with our communities and lead the industry in growth and innovation. With crafting classes, store events, store displays, mobile applications and online videos, we offer an omnichannel shopping experience that can inspire creativity and build confidence in our customers’ artistic abilities. 
​
As of February 1, 2020, we operated 1,274 Michaels retail stores in 49 states and Canada, with approximately 18,000 average square feet of selling space per store. 
​
In January 2019 and March 2018, we closed our Pat Catan’s and Aaron Brothers stores, respectively. As a result of the store closures, we recorded restructure charges of $8.2 million and $98.9 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The restructure charges in fiscal 2019 are primarily related to employee-related expenses and the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The restructure charges in fiscal 2018 primarily related to the transfer of the rights to sell inventory and other assets to a third party to facilitate the store closures and assist with the disposition of our remaining lease obligations, the impairment of goodwill and employee-related expenses.
​
In addition, we recorded $5.3 million of employee-related charges in fiscal 2018 as a result of certain organizational changes made to streamline our operations at our corporate support center.
​
During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, Aaron Brothers net sales totaled $12.9 million and $110.4 million, respectively, and Pat Catan’s net sales totaled $109.6 million and $113.4 million, respectively. Excluding the restructure charges, Aaron Brothers and Pat Catan’s did not have a material impact on the Company’s operating income in all fiscal periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
​
During fiscal 2019, we identified impairment indicators within our Darice wholesale business (“Darice”) that were primarily due to a deterioration in sales associated with overall declining demand from customers. These indicators led us to revise Darice’s forecasted sales downward and resulted in a significantly lower operating plan in fiscal 2019. As a result, we performed impairment tests on Darice’s goodwill, indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, including operating lease assets. As a result of this impairment testing, Darice recorded an impairment charge of $40.1 million in fiscal 2019, consisting of $17.8 million related to goodwill, $14.4 million related to long-lived assets, including operating lease assets, and $7.9 million related to indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets. As of February 1, 2020, the carrying value of Darice’s operating lease assets, adjusted for the impairment charge, totaled 

3




$31.9 million. The carrying value of the remaining long-lived assets related to Darice, including intangible assets, are not material.
​
On November 22, 2019, the Company acquired certain intangible assets from A.C. Moore Incorporated for $62.1 million, including customer relationships and tradenames totaling $56.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively. In connection with the transaction, we also leased a distribution facility in New Jersey and 19 store locations. The store locations will be reopened under the Michaels brand name in fiscal 2020 and will include the relocation of certain existing Michaels stores. We believe the transaction will enable us to expand our presence in strategic markets and better serve our customers both online and in stores.
​
Merchandising
​
Michaels. Each Michaels store offers approximately 45,000 basic and seasonal stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) in a number of product categories. The following table shows a breakdown of sales for Michaels stores by department as a percentage of total net sales:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------+---+-------------+---+------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year | 
​ | | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 
General crafts | | 47 | % | 48 | % | 49 | %
Home décor and seasonal | | 23 | ​ | 24 | ​ | 23 | ​
Custom and ready-made framing | | 16 | ​ | 16 | ​ | 16 | ​
Papercrafting | | 14 | ​ | 12 | ​ | 12 | ​
​ | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

​
We have category merchant, product development, sourcing and design teams focused on quality, innovation and cost mitigation. Our internal product development and global sourcing teams position us to deliver a differentiated level of innovation, quality and value to our customers. Our global sourcing network allows us to control new product introductions, maintain quality standards, monitor delivery times, and manage product costs and inventory levels to enhance profitability. In an industry with few well-known national brands, our private brands are recognized as a leader in many categories. We continue to expand our private brands and improve the selection of products we design, develop and deliver to our customers. Our Michaels’ private brands totaled approximately 60% of net sales in fiscal 2019 and include, among others, Recollections®, Studio Decor®, Bead Landing®, Creatology®, Ashland®, Celebrate It®, ArtMinds®, Artist’s Loft®, Craft Smart®, Loops & Threads®, Make Market®, Imagin8®, and Sticky Sticks®.
​
We continue to search for ways to leverage our position as a market leader by establishing strategic partnerships and exclusive product relationships to provide our customers with exciting merchandise. We have partnerships with popular brands such as Crayola, Elmer’s and Cricut. We will continue to explore opportunities to form future partnerships and exclusive product associations. 
​
Darice. We operate an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name. Darice sources products from domestic and foreign suppliers for resale to a variety of retail outlets worldwide, including our Michaels stores. Darice offers approximately 31,000 SKUs consisting of a wide range of craft and hobby items. We also develop Darice branded products carried by both Michaels and third-party stores reflecting the breadth of our product line and our ability to distribute and source quality products at competitive prices.
​
E-commerce. Our e-commerce business provides an important avenue to communicate with our customers in an interactive way that reinforces the Michaels brand and drives traffic to our stores and websites. We continue to strengthen our omnichannel offering with the expansion of our buy online, pick up in store capabilities and through continuous enhancements to our existing platforms to improve discoverability, product content and personalization of customer messaging that will deliver a superior customer experience. Our online platforms, which offer over 100,000 basic and seasonal SKUs, currently include Michaels.com, Canada.Michaels.com, ConsumerCrafts.com, Darice.com, AaronBrothers.com (our online custom framing solution) and our Michaels app, which connects our store and online experiences.

Purchasing and Inventory Management
​
We purchase merchandise from a variety of different vendors primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Michaels Stores Procurement Company, Inc. We believe our buying power and ability to make centralized purchases enable us to acquire products on favorable terms. Centralized merchandising management teams negotiate with vendors in an attempt to obtain the lowest merchandise costs and to improve product mix and inventory levels. In fiscal 2019, there were no vendors who accounted for more than 10% of total purchases.
​
We have also developed direct sourcing capabilities through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Darice International Sourcing Group. We believe our direct sourcing operation allows us to maintain greater control over the manufacturing process, resulting in improved product quality and lower costs. In addition, our stores purchase custom frames, framing supplies and mats from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artistree, Inc. (“Artistree”), which consists of a manufacturing facility and three regional processing centers. 
​
The majority of the products sold in our stores are manufactured in Asia. Goods manufactured in Asia generally require long lead times and are ordered two to four months in advance of delivery. Those products are either imported directly by us or acquired from distributors based in the U.S.
​
Our automated replenishment system uses perpetual inventory records to analyze on-hand SKU quantities by store, as well as other pertinent information such as sales forecasts, seasonal selling patterns, promotional events and vendor lead times, to generate recommended merchandise reorder information. These recommended orders are reviewed daily and purchase orders are delivered electronically to our vendors and our distribution centers. In addition to improving our store in-stock position, these systems enable us to better forecast merchandise ordering quantities for our vendors and give us the ability to identify, order and replenish the stores’ merchandise. These systems also allow us to react more quickly to sales trends and allow our store team members to devote more time to customer service, thereby improving inventory productivity and sales opportunities.
​
Artistree
​
We own and operate Artistree, a vertically-integrated framing operation which supplies precut mats and high quality custom framing merchandise in our stores and on aaronbrothers.com. We believe Artistree provides a competitive advantage and gives us quality control over the entire framing process. Custom framing orders are processed and shipped to our stores where the custom frame order is completed for customer pick-up.
​
Our moulding manufacturing plant, located in Kernersville, North Carolina, converts lumber into finished frame moulding that is used at our regional processing centers to fulfill custom framing orders for our customers. We manufacture approximately 37% of the moulding that we process and import approximately 57% from quality manufacturers in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Spain and Italy. The remaining mouldings are purchased from domestic manufacturers. 
​
We operate three regional processing centers located in DFW Airport, Texas; Kernersville, North Carolina; and Mississauga, Ontario. Combined, these facilities occupy approximately 489,000 square feet and, in fiscal 2019, processed 24.0 million linear feet of frame moulding and 3.6 million individual custom cut mats and foam boards for our customers. Our precut mats and custom frame supplies are packaged and distributed out of our DFW Airport regional processing center.
​
Distribution
​
We currently operate eight distribution centers to supply our stores with merchandise. Approximately 92% of our stores’ merchandise receipts are shipped through the distribution network with the remainder shipped directly from vendors to stores. Our distribution centers are located in California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. In fiscal 2019, we completed the implementation of an internal process to fulfill e-commerce orders though our distribution center in Texas that will allow us to maintain greater control over our e-commerce order fulfillment process. On November 22, 2019, we also executed a lease for a distribution facility in New Jersey that will allow us to more efficiently replenish merchandise in our stores. 
​
Our distribution facilities use warehouse management and control software systems to maintain and support the efficient movement of product through our supply chain. Store replenishment is performed using pick-to-light and radio 

5




frequency processing technologies as well as other common material handling equipment. Product is delivered to stores using both a dedicated fleet of trucks and contract carriers. 
​
Marketing
​
We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, acquire new customers, improve customer retention and increase frequency of shopping. We communicate with our current and prospective customers through multiple channels, including direct mail, email, newspaper inserts, television and digital advertising.
​
We continue to develop and leverage our customer data analytic capabilities to drive a more customer-centric strategy through targeted marketing and promotions. We believe that targeted marketing and promotions play an important role in today’s retail environment by improving the impact of digital media, email, coupons and promotional events. In July 2016, we launched our rewards program, Michaels Rewards, in the U.S. and in July 2018, we launched the program in Canada. Michaels Rewards continues to grow and has surpassed 43 million customers. Michaels Rewards offers customers tailored, exclusive offers and events such as sneak peeks for new product, early alerts for big sales and receipt-free returns. The program adds to our customer database and, we believe, will allow us to further target our marketing and promotions more effectively. In fiscal 2020, we intend to expand Michaels Rewards by enabling customers to earn rewards on purchases that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. We believe the expansion of our rewards program is an important tool to increase retention of existing customers and enhance their loyalty to the Michaels brand.
​
Seasonality
​
Our business is highly seasonal, with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Our fourth quarter, which includes the Holiday selling season, has on average accounted for approximately 34% of our net sales and approximately 46% of our operating income.
​
Our Industry
​
According to internal market research, approximately 53% of U.S. households participated in at least one crafting project during 2018, which represented approximately 67 million households. This research indicated that crafting activities continue to enjoy broad based popularity and market size has been stable, valued at approximately $36 billion. We believe the broad, multi-generational appeal, high personal attachment and the low-cost, project-based nature of crafting creates a loyal, resilient following.

​
We believe, based on an internal real estate and market penetration study of Michaels stores, that the combined U.S. and Canadian markets can support between 1,400 and 1,500 Michaels stores. We plan to open approximately 45 Michaels stores, including approximately 16 relocations, in fiscal 2020. We continue to pursue a store relocation program to improve the real estate location quality and performance of our store base. During fiscal 2020, we plan to close up to 10 Michaels stores. Many of our store closings are stores that have reached the end of their lease term. We believe our ongoing store evaluation process results in strong performance across our store base.
​
Our store operating model, which is based on historical store performance, assumes an average store size of approximately 18,000 square feet of selling space. Our fiscal 2019 average initial net investment, which varies by site and specific store characteristics, was $0.7 million per store, including store build-out costs, pre-opening expenses and average first year inventory.
​
Employees
​
As of February 1, 2020, we employed approximately 44,000 team members, approximately 32,000 of whom were employed on a part-time basis. The number of part-time team members substantially increases during the Holiday selling season. Of our full-time team members, approximately 4,000 are engaged in various executive, operating, training, distribution and administrative functions in our support center, division offices, administrative offices and distribution centers and the remainder are engaged in store operations. None of our team members are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
​
Competition
​
We are the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America based on store count. The market in which we compete is highly fragmented and includes stores across the U.S. and Canada operated primarily by small, independent retailers along with a few regional and national chains. We believe customers choose where to shop based upon store 

7




location, breadth of selection, price, quality of merchandise, availability of product and customer service. We compete with many different types of retailers and classify our competition within the following categories:
​

● | Multi-store chains. This category consists of several multi-store chains, each operating more than 100 stores, including: Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which operates approximately 900 stores in 46 states and Jo-Ann Stores, Inc., which operates approximately 870 stores in 49 states. We believe these chains are smaller than Michaels with respect to net sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Mass merchandisers. This category of retailers typically dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of home décor, arts and crafts supplies and seasonal merchandise, but they do seek to capitalize on the latest trends by stocking products that are complementary to those trends and their current merchandise offerings. These mass merchandisers generally have limited customer service staffs with minimal experience in crafting projects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Small, local specialty retailers. This category includes local independent arts and crafts retailers and custom framing shops. Typically, these stores are single-store operations managed by the owner. These stores generally have limited resources for advertising, purchasing and distribution. Many of these stores have established a loyal customer base within a given community and compete based on relationships and customer service.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Internet. This category includes all internet-based retailers that sell arts and crafts merchandise, completed projects and online custom framing. Our internet competition is inclusive of those companies discussed in the categories above, as well as others that may only sell products online. These retailers provide consumers with the ability to search and compare products and prices without having to visit a physical store. These sellers generally offer a wide variety of products but do not offer product expertise or project advice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
