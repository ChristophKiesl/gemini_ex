ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Slack is the leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack is where work happens.
The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email (or the Internet or electricity), Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks.
Unlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication. Slack also enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts, and the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack.
Also unlike email, Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Further, Slack’s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization’s internally-developed software. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the three months ended January 31, 2021. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code solution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface. 
Ultimately, Slack is more than email replacement. It is a new layer of the business technology stack that brings together people, applications, and data. Just as an operating system coordinates the flow of information and resources of a computer in a centralized fashion, using Slack inside an organization and across organizations creates a hub into which critical business information flows, is acted upon and transformed, and is then quickly routed to its desired destination. Slack streamlines our users’ workflows, increases the beneficial return on the time they spend communicating, and creates a powerful point of leverage for increased productivity. 
Summary of Key Benefits 
Working in Slack provides several key benefits to users, teams, and organizations and to our platform ecosystem: 
•People love using Slack and that leads to high levels of engagement. Slack is enterprise software created with an eye for user experience usually associated with consumer products. We believe that the more simple, enjoyable, and intuitive the product is, the more people will want to use it. As a result, teams benefit from the aggregated attention that happens when all members of a team are engaged in a single collaboration tool.
•Slack increases an organization’s “return on communication.” Moving to channel-based communication increases accessibility of communication, which in turn increases transparency and breaks down silos. The organization benefits from increased coordination and alignment from a given amount of communication, with no additional effort in the form of status reports, update meetings, and so on.
•Slack increases the value of existing software investment. As a flexible platform for routing information of all kinds, Slack integrates horizontally with thousands of other applications, from those provided by companies like Google, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Atlassian, and Dropbox to the proprietary line-of-business applications developed by organizations for their own internal use. Integration with Slack increases both the accessibility of information inside applications and the response times for many basic actions. Because Slack users can do virtually everything on Slack on mobile that they can do on desktop, they do not need to have dozens of work applications on their mobile devices to be able to make lightweight use of those applications on the go.
•An organization’s archive of data increases in value over time. As teams continue to use Slack, they build a valuable resource of widely accessible information. Important messages are surrounded by useful context and users can see how fellow team members created and worked with the information and arrived at a decision. New employees can have instant access to the information they need to be effective whenever they join a new team or company. Finally, the content on Slack is available through powerful search and discovery tools, powered by machine learning, which improve through usage.
•Slack helps organizations improve culture and employees’ feelings of empowerment. When every member of a team learns from, and contributes towards, common goals, people feel they have greater influence over the ultimate outcomes of their work. By keeping all team members in the information flow, we believe that Slack increases this sense that members of a team can have an impact and make a difference and that creates greater team cohesion and increases motivation.
•Slack helps achieve organizational agility. Slack’s channels immerse workers directly into the dynamic and evolving communication, decision making, and data flow that defines modern work. Because workers have both more access to data updated in real time and more context for that data, they are better able to quickly react and adjust work streams in response to new business priorities or changing conditions while staying in alignment with one another. This same organizational agility extends outside an organization with Slack Connect, integrating conversations and work streams with partners in shared channels and enabling broader alignment.
•Developers are better able to reach and deliver value to their customers. Slack has aggregated hundreds of thousands of organizations on one platform and made it easier for developers to distribute their software to any Slack-using organization. By making information from their applications available and allowing users to perform key actions through a whole new interface, developers can make their customers happier and more engaged.
Our Business Model 
From the outset, our go-to-market strategy has centered around offering an exceptional product and level of service to organizations on Slack. We have both a self-service offering and a direct sales force to address customers who do not want to buy through the self-serve model or who need the additional capabilities of our enterprise products. Our direct sales force and customer success professionals focus on driving successful adoption and expansion within organizations. We believe deep user engagement and an obsessive focus on customer experience are catalysts for expanding paid adoption within organizations.
We define an organization on Slack as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer.
As of January 31, 2021, Slack had more than 756,000 organizations with three or more users, comprised of:
•More than 600,000 organizations on our Free subscription plan; and 
•More than 156,000 Paid Customers.
Many of these Paid Customers have thousands of active users and our largest Paid Customers have more than one hundred thousand employees using Slack on a regular basis. The number of organizations on Slack is highly diversified, and during the years ended January 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, no Paid Customer accounted for more than 3% of our revenue.
Our users, whether on a free or paid subscription plan, are highly engaged, and their collective active use of Slack for the week ended January 31, 2021 exceeded 105 million hours. During the week ended January 31, 2021, more than 2.2 billion messages were sent in Slack. During this same time, on a typical workday, users at Paid Customers averaged more than ten hours connected to Slack through at least one device and spent more than 110 minutes actively using Slack. We believe that this broad, active user base and deep user engagement propel increased adoption within organizations and inspire many organizations to become Paid Customers.
Our direct sales and customer success efforts are focused on larger organizations who have a greater number of users and teams and have the potential to increase spend over time. As our business has matured, we have seen a growth in sales through our direct sales force. We measure the number of Paid Customers > $100,000 of annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as a gauge of adoption within and expansion into large enterprises. As of January 31, 2021, we had 1,183 Paid Customers >$100,000 of ARR, which accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue in fiscal year 2021. 
We generate revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions for Slack. Paid customers typically pay on a monthly or annual basis, based on the number of users that they have on Slack.
What Sets Us Apart 
Singular focus
Our development, design, partnerships, customer engagement, and investments are targeted at realizing the enormity and simplicity of Slack’s singular mission: to make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. We have no legacy products or competing priorities. We believe our platform has broad enough utility and a large enough market that we can remain focused indefinitely.
Scale and market leadership
The strength of our market leadership is demonstrated by the scale and growth of our users, the high level of engagement within our user base, our growth within organizations, the breadth of applications that integrate with Slack, and the size of our developer ecosystem. We believe we know more about how organizations use platforms like Slack than anyone else in the world and will put this knowledge to work faster.
Strong increasing returns dynamics
As Slack usage increases inside an organization, more value is created for each additional user who might join, as well as for all existing users. As organizations continue to use Slack over time, the value of their archive increases and they realize more utility in their usage. We believe shared channels between organizations will increase the value of the overall Slack network for each new organization that joins as well as for all existing network members. Slack also generates more value for developers as more users and more organizations join Slack, and users and organizations are more attracted to Slack as more apps are integrated into or built on our platform.
Customer love leading to stickiness and organic expansion 
People love using Slack and many become advocates for wider use inside their organizations. They also tend to recommend Slack when they switch jobs or join organizations that are not yet using Slack. There are thousands of 
tweets and other public endorsements or recommendations of Slack, a source of growth that is exceptional in enterprise software. 
Differentiated go-to-market strategy 
Organic growth is generated as users realize the benefits of Slack. This growth enables us to attract new and prospective organizations through an effective self-service customer engagement model for free and paid subscription plans. We also employ direct sales efforts targeted at new organizations and organizations with existing organic adoption of Slack. Once prospective organizations are identified, our direct sales and customer success teams work to broaden adoption of Slack into wider-scale deployments. 
Customer-centricity as the fundamental tenet of our company 
We build our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings. We aim for radical convenience and do our best to anticipate the needs of our users. Empathy and respect for users is built into our company values and this mindset extends to our broader sales and customer engagement model. We focus on customer support for free and paid subscription plans and treat it as a critical and strategic imperative for our company. We believe people should leave every interaction with a Slack representative feeling that they have been heard, respected, and helped by a human being who truly understands Slack and the experience of depending on it for work. This quality of service has a real impact on user behavior: based on our internal data, users who interact with our customer experience team are eight times more likely to become paid users than those who do not.
Our Service
Slack is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work.
Slack’s key functionality
•Messaging and Channels: Slack users communicate with one another by posting messages to a channel or sending direct messages to a person or a group of people. Slack’s core organizing principle is the channel, which brings the right people together to collaborate, share information, and get work done. Channels offer flexibility and can be organized by project, topic, team, or whatever makes sense for a specific task or situation. Public channels are accessible to all users within a Slack workspace. For more exclusive workstreams and conversations, users create invite-only channels.
Within channels, users post messages, documents, and images and interact with other software. Users can search for information about a topic or project, find a relevant channel, join it, and scroll through the channel’s entire history, finding messages and contextual content. Slack enables users to optimize the way they use the service, allowing users to choose when to receive notifications and customize alerts by person, keyword, channel, or application.
•Integrations: Through integrations with both third-party and internally-built software applications, users of Slack are able to easily access and interact in their channels with information from other applications. We believe this makes Slack users more productive at work and increases the value of other software programs. For example, a user may look up customer account information in Salesforce or get updates on deployment status through GitHub within Slack. More advanced use cases include the ability to design custom workflows, which can automatically perform a series of tasks and actions in Slack in otherwise unconnected software applications. For example, creating a customer service ticket routing application that brings together information from a Zendesk ticket, customer data from Salesforce, and suggested solutions from an internally-built knowledge base — all without leaving Slack. 
•Shared Channels: Slack enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts. Shared channels, also called Slack Connect, securely connect the Slack workspaces of different organizations, enabling the same level of communication and collaboration between enterprises that Slack brings to teams within an organization. Shared channels can be public or 
invite-only and contain all of the powerful tools and integrations of Slack along with an added layer of administrative capabilities to regulate and monitor the flow of information between organizations. Guest accounts allow workspace owners to invite people from outside their organizations to join one or more channels. 
As of January 31, 2021, more than 74,000 Paid Customers have adopted shared channels using Slack Connect. We believe adoption of this feature will grow significantly in the coming years, both in terms of network participants and network density. Because the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack, we expect Slack Connect to create more utility for existing users and be an important factor in future growth.
•Search: Everything in Slack, including messages, posts from applications, and text content of files is searchable, so that permissioned users can tap into company knowledge and find information when they need it. Over time, use of Slack creates an archive of information generated by an organization that is universally available, persistent and contextual, making Slack’s search function increasingly useful. Our search capability offers a range of filters and modifiers to allow users easy and efficient access to specific knowledge from potentially vast repositories of information. We also leverage machine learning to deliver personalized search results based on user behavior and context, such as the people a user may communicate with most often, the files that may be most relevant to the user and the channels in which the user tends to participate.
Our Subscription Plans
We offer four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of our users: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. 
Our Free, Standard, and Plus subscription plans consist of a single workspace, which we define as a Slack environment configured for a team. These plans are most often adopted by small and medium sized teams. From time to time, we provide additional features and functionality, such as enterprise key management, to meet specialized requirements of organizations on Slack.
Our Enterprise Grid plan is uniquely designed for larger organizations, which typically are more complex and require enhanced functionality, flexibility, administrative control, and security at scale. Enterprise Grid allows paid customers to:
•create and manage an unlimited set of connected workspaces and channels;
•search across multiple workspaces, making it easy for workers and administrators to tap into their organization’s collective knowledge at scale;
•access centralized controls to ensure a company’s data remains secure, giving administrators a single point of visibility to provision and manage Slack; and
•integrate with third-party e-Discovery and data loss prevention tools to help meet security and compliance requirements.
The Slack Platform
Our technology platform was purpose built to enable independent software developers and organizations to integrate existing software with Slack or build entirely new applications that provide new features for Slack users. We believe that the power of Slack is amplified through integration with third-party and internal software, providing easy, intuitive access to a broad range of applications. Our platform consists of a set of open, documented APIs, developer tools, and an App Directory that lists apps that have met our guidelines. Organizations on Slack use our platform to create internal applications and integrations, ranging from simple notifications to complex internal workflows. Third-party developers build integrations and applications that make it easier for their existing customers to engage with their products as well as find new customers. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code 
solution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface.
Our App Directory lists applications and integrations that address virtually all aspects of knowledge work. These applications and integrations connect Slack users with software from some of the world’s largest technology companies to some of the smallest startups.
We foster our platform ecosystem through our dedicated Slack API site, open source forums, software development kits, global developer events, partnerships, and technical support for developers building for their own companies or aiming to list their apps in our App Directory.
Our Sales and Marketing Approach
We combine a web-based, self-service go-to-market approach with direct sales efforts that focus on growing users within larger organizations and acquiring new large paid customers. We believe that these go-to-market approaches reinforce one another; self-service users often become leads for our direct sales force and users within larger enterprises create organic awareness of Slack inside and outside their organizations. We complement these sales and marketing activities with an obsessive focus on customer experience and customer success.
Self-service adoption and marketing
Many organizations adopt Slack initially as part of our self-service go-to-market approach. We deploy a range of marketing strategies and tactics to drive initial awareness and adoption. These include brand advertising, public relations, digital marketing campaigns, free trials of our paid plans, product localization, in-product customer education, and a website designed to teach new users about Slack.
Organizations on Slack are diverse, and range from businesses to non-governmental organizations, universities, sports clubs, and open source communities. They often start by using our free version. We believe free usage helps create champions of Slack, and as these prospective paid customers realize the value of Slack, they spread the word organically throughout their networks and organizations.
As organizations engage more deeply with Slack, both through using Slack for collaboration and communication and integrating more third-party and internally-developed software via our platform, they often upgrade to paid plans via our website. Organizations also upgrade to paid plans to utilize features such as shared channels and enhanced security and administration capabilities. We support this upgrade path through targeted marketing campaigns and in-product prompts highlighting the added benefits and features of our paid plans.
Direct sales and marketing
To increase adoption within larger paid customers and acquire new paid customers, we utilize a direct sales organization. Our direct sales force often leverages the Slack champions and proofs of concept developed through self-service adoption. We combine this bottoms-up demand with direct sales efforts targeted at C-suite executives and business unit leaders.
These efforts include a globally distributed direct sales force, solutions engineering, demand generation campaigns, webinars, analyst relations, C-suite events, and cooperative marketing efforts with our partners. We also host an annual user conference, Frontiers, where we bring together organizations and partners around the world to share best practices on achieving organizational alignment, unveil the latest Slack features, educate users, and embrace our growing application developer and platform ecosystem.
Customer experience and customer success
Our customer experience team provides support to users of both free and paid versions of Slack and is core to enhancing user adoption, free-to-paid conversion, and subscription renewal. Additionally, our customer experience team receives and quantifies feedback from organizations on Slack at scale. This focus on responsiveness and personal touch helps us optimize customer satisfaction and identify high-value opportunities for both user-facing and internal product improvements.
Our educational offerings include a range of free, web-based classes and tutorials on how to use, administer, optimize, and customize Slack, as well as how to integrate other applications, build custom workflows, and build entirely new applications on Slack. We also offer in-person training through our developer relations program and at events for organizations on Slack.
Our customer success team supports larger organizations through every step of their journey with Slack. This starts with supporting onboarding, workspace best practices, change management, and education, and continues with renewals and expansion to other functional teams, departments, or business units. In addition, we offer professional services tailored to the needs of organizations on Slack.
Our Partnerships
Slack has a robust and diverse partner ecosystem that includes leading enterprise software companies, security providers, systems integrators, and new, emerging companies. Our partner ecosystem extends and enhances Slack through integrations and operates as an important component of our go-to-market strategy. Partners serve as a source of enterprise sales leads and help to accelerate our sales cycles through co-selling and services delivery. Our partners benefit from growth in customer engagement with their products and services and new opportunities to grow their users and customers.
Slack Fund
Investing is also a component of our partnerships strategy. Slack Fund L.L.C., or the Slack Fund, is an investment fund that we initially started, in partnership with entities affiliated with certain of our stockholders: Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Social Capital, and Spark Capital. We created the fund to support companies building applications on the Slack platform and other applications that are focused on the next generation of enterprise software. By the end of fiscal year 2021, Slack Fund invested all of the capital initially committed by Slack and our partners. In March 2021, we purchased all the outstanding LLC interests from the other Slack Fund members, and Slack currently owns all of the LLC interests in Slack Fund. We have invested and will continue to invest in start-up companies that we believe enhance the value of Slack and that are focused on the future of work, with funding for these investments coming solely from Slack. 
Human Capital
At Slack, our goal is to make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive — not only for our users but also for our own workforce. We believe that the success of our workforce is critical to the success of our business. Slack’s culture is rooted in a sense of belonging, encouraging personal and professional growth, and the ability to empathize and relate to one another. 
As of January 31, 2021, we had 2,545 full-time employees. We supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants. In June 2020, we announced that we would allow many of our employees to work remotely on a permanent basis. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business, contribute to our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary, short-term annual incentive bonuses and long-term equity compensation. We also provide our employees with comprehensive employee benefit programs, such as medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan, and life and disability insurance.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to embedding diversity, engagement and belonging in our workplace and in our hiring practices. We are focused on building an inclusive culture and sustaining a diverse workforce through a variety of company initiatives. As part of that effort we have a number of executive-sponsored employee resource groups that 
provide support for diverse members of our workforce by fostering an inclusive environment and providing professional development and community-building opportunities. In addition, we provide resources and training to employees at all levels to ensure that we are hiring, promoting and retaining diverse teams, as well as sponsor a number of professional development programs to support the advance of underrepresented employees at Slack. We also publish an annual diversity report to share our data and evaluate our approaches.
Health, Safety and Wellness
Our success is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes such as facilitating teleworking that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’ health and wellness needs. 
Slack for Good
Part of our culture is what we refer to as Slack for Good. Slack for Good’s principal focus is to increase the representation of people from backgrounds that have been historically under-represented in the technology industry. We have pledged 1% of employee time, 1% of our equity, and 1% of our product to activities associated with Slack for Good. We encourage our employees to volunteer their time to support causes of their choice and provide them with paid time off to do so. We have reserved 1.2 million shares of our Class B common stock for potential future sale to fund and support our social impact initiatives. We also donate money and discount access to our service for non-profit organizations.
Research and Development
We build our software with the user in mind — we invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of the needs of organizations on Slack and we continually innovate on our product. Unlike traditional enterprise software, we aim to release new features to users and organizations on Slack as quickly as possible through internal testing releases and external beta cycles to ensure that we are constantly receiving feedback. We leverage the power of our expansive user base and our focused customer service philosophy to collect feedback on product features to enhance our development process.
Research and development expenses were $382.1 million, $457.4 million, and $157.5 million, including stock-based compensation of $115.0 million, $226.5 million, and $9.9 million, for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We have built our technology infrastructure using a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale.
We designed our technology platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability and low latency. Incremental backups are performed hourly and full backups are performed daily. In addition, redundant copies of content are stored in at least two geographically separate regions and are replicated within each region. Data is transmitted in encrypted form and encrypted when stored in our system. We use Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as our processing and delivery infrastructure.
We have built a network operations infrastructure that combines automated, 24x7 telemetry with human monitoring to help ensure that any issues that arise with our service are addressed as quickly as possible. We publish our uptime metrics, system status, and event reports on our public website so that users and organizations know how our systems are performing at any given time.
Security, Privacy, and Data Protection
Trust is important for our relationship with users and organizations on Slack, and we take significant measures to protect their privacy and data.
Security
We devote considerable resources to our security program, which is dedicated to ensuring that organizations on Slack have the highest confidence in our custodianship of their data. Our security program is aligned to the ISO 27000 standards and is regularly audited and assessed by third parties as well as organizations on Slack.
Our security program consists of the following:
•Organizational security including security and privacy training, a team of dedicated security professionals, policies and standards, separation of duties, and regular audits, compliance activities, and third-party assessments;
•Secure by design principles by which we assess the security risk of each software development project according to our secure development lifecycle and create a set of requirements that must be met before the resulting change may be released to production; and
•Public bug bounty program to facilitate responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities identified by external researchers and reward them for their verified findings.
The focus of our security program is to prevent unauthorized access to the data of organizations on Slack. To this end, our team of security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across our company, work to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve. These steps include data encryption in transit and at rest, network security, classifying and inventorying data, limiting and authorizing access controls, and multi-factor authentication for access to systems with data. We also employ regular system monitoring, logging, and alerting to retain and analyze the security state of our corporate and production infrastructure.
In addition, our security program has achieved several internationally-recognized certifications and industry standard audited attestations of our security controls, and maintains a number of compliance programs. Slack offers support for HIPAA-regulated organizations that purchase Enterprise Grid.
We take appropriate steps to help ensure that our security measures are maintained by the third-party vendors we use, including by conducting security reviews and audits.
Privacy and data protection
The privacy of users and protection of data is important to Slack’s continued growth and success. Privacy is a shared responsibility among all our employees, but we also have a dedicated privacy and data governance team that builds and executes on our privacy program, including the management of data protection impact assessments. Our privacy and legal teams work together to conduct product and feature reviews, data inventory and mapping, and support for data protection and privacy-related requests.
We are committed to complying with, and helping organizations on Slack comply with, data protection laws globally. We monitor guidance from industry and regulatory bodies, meet with regulators and update our product features and contractual commitments accordingly.
Slack is offered to organizations outside the United States and Canada by Slack Technologies Limited, an Irish company based in Dublin, Ireland, which is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the regulatory oversight of the Irish Data Protection Commission. We also maintain a self-certification under the current E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs and offer European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security and Privacy—We may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in Europe particularly due to the European General Data Protection Regulation.”
We maintain a privacy policy that describes how Slack collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices organizations and users have.
Competition
The market for services like Slack is emerging, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, and we believe that Slack represents a new category of business technology. As a result, we principally compete against collaboration and communication tools and products from established vendors, such as Microsoft, productivity tool and email providers, such as Google, unified communications providers, such as Cisco, and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market, such as Facebook. We also compete with smaller companies that offer niche or point products that attempt to address certain problems that Slack addresses. These smaller companies include companies that specialize in voice or video communication, instant messaging, email filtering, and email inbox organization, business workflows, team-based collaboration, intranet creation and maintenance, and other functionality. Some of these companies offer free or discounted services. We believe that we compete favorably with these smaller companies because they do not offer the unique mix of features and functionality combined with our proven ability to scale to handle large amounts of users, usage, and data. In addition, our market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, new market entrants, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
•ease of adoption, use, and deployment;
•product functionality;
•platform capabilities;
•breadth and depth of platform integrations;
•scalability, availability and reliability;
•security and privacy;
•ability to support intercompany collaboration;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•customer support; and
•total cost of ownership.
Competition has intensified in recent periods, and we expect competition to continue to intensify as established and emerging companies continue to enter the markets we serve or attempt to address the problems Slack addresses, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, technologies, and regulations are introduced. Many of our existing competitors have longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets, access to larger existing user bases, and greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our larger competitors, such as Microsoft, have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing Slack, including through offering free products, selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, forced product migrations, auto-installation of applications, or closed technology platforms. We believe this has confused the market for Slack, lengthened certain sales cycles, and caused certain prospective customers not to purchase Slack. In addition, the product bundling and forced product migrations described above have reduced, and may in the future reduce, the overall market for Slack by preventing us from gaining access to sales opportunities and by forcing us to spend more resources to market and sell Slack. In July 2020, we filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission for engaging in certain behaviors that we believe are unlawful and anti-competitive. The complaint process is costly and time-consuming and we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the process with the European Commission. We believe, however, that we are uniquely positioned to more rapidly innovate and respond to new technologies and customer requirements than our competitors. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The market and software categories in which we participate are competitive, new, and rapidly changing, and if we do not compete effectively with 
established companies as well as new market entrants our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.”
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure, and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
As of January 31, 2021, we had over 120 issued U.S. and foreign patents and over 240 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, including patents and patent applications acquired from third parties. The expiration dates of our patents range from calendar years 2021 to 2040. The patent applications we file are intended to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business, and we have in the past and may in the future acquire additional patents, patent portfolios, or patent applications.
