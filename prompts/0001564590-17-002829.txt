ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Sun Hydraulics Corporation (“Sun,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), founded in 1970, in Sarasota, FL, is an industrial technology leader that develops and manufactures solutions for both the hydraulics and electronics markets.  In the hydraulics market, we are a leading manufacturer of high-performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves, electro-hydraulics, manifolds, and integrated package solutions for the worldwide industrial and mobile hydraulics markets operating under the brand Sun Hydraulics. In the electronics market, we are a global provider of innovative electronic control, display and instrumentation solutions for both recreational and off-highway vehicles, as well as stationary and power generation equipment; these are offered under the brands of Enovation Controls, Murphy and Zero Off.  Additionally, High Country Tek (“HCT”) is an independent designer and producer of modular, robust, reliable digital and analog electronic controller products for the fluid power industry sold under the brand of HCT.  
 Sun has operated in the North American market for over 47 years.  We have expanded our global footprint over the past 30 years to include operations in the UK, Germany and Korea, as well as sales offices in China and India.  Enovation Controls, LLC, (“Enovation Controls”) which was acquired by Sun on December 5, 2016 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun, was formed in 2009 in connection with the reorganization of Murphy Group, Inc. and EControls Group, Inc. which were founded in 1939 and 1994, respectively.  Enovation Controls operates the majority of its manufacturing in Tulsa, OK with sales and engineering capabilities in San Antonio, TX, the UK, China and India.  HCT has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Hydraulics Corporation since 2011 and operates in Nevada City, CA. 
 Until 2016, Sun operated primarily in the hydraulics market with a small presence in the electronics market through HCT.   On December 5, 2016, Sun purchased two of the four lines of business of Enovation Controls, namely the Power Controls and Vehicle Technologies businesses, retaining the legal entity and related brands.  The remaining non-acquired lines of business will continue to operate as a newly formed company not owned by Sun.  The expansion of Sun’s electronic and digital capabilities through the acquisition of Enovation Controls is a significant step towards achieving our long term strategic vision.  The acquisition further diversifies Sun, granting us access to new, highly specialized markets and customers seeking complete machine control.  Enovation Controls brings a strong talent pool with a proven track record of new product development and technical innovation, complementing our current competencies.  
 A primary focus of our strategic thinking is the identification of megatrends, such as globalization, which will impact the future capital and industrial goods markets.  We believe global population growth and urbanization, driven predominantly by Asian mega-cities, will generate ongoing demand for infrastructure projects, resources and food production, all of which require equipment and machinery from our key end markets.  Sophistication of safe machinery and equipment is the second megatrend we recognize.  Today’s machine users demand safety, productivity, efficiency, and even automated control. Advancements in the design of these machines require continuous evolution of critical components such as hydraulic and electronic functionality control.  The final relevant megatrend is computing power.  In this electronic and digital age, what used to be manual or mechanical, is now driven by electrical power.  Information is converted into a form that allows it to be processed, stored and transmitted digitally, saving both time and energy required.  
 As a result of these megatrends, we developed our 2025 Vision which is focused on growth and reaching a critical mass of one billion dollars in sales.  There are two significant components to reaching this goal: organic growth and acquisitions.  By 2025, we expect up to half of the one billion dollars in revenue to result from organic growth of our existing products and geographic markets, and the other half to be derived from acquisitions of companies that advance our technology position with adjacent products for the industrial goods sector.  Product innovations are well underway to aid the organic growth and fill the demand resulting from the megatrends.  The acquisition of Enovation Controls is the first important step toward achieving global technology leadership.  All growth initiatives are intended to preserve Sun’s history of superior profitability and financial strength.

We have been profitable every year since 1972 and Sun has paid a dividend every quarter since going public in January 1997. 
 The Company’s executive offices are located at 1500 West University Parkway, Sarasota, Florida 34243, and our telephone number is (941) 362-1200. Our websites include www.sunhydraulics.com, www.enovationcontrols.com, www.zerogps.com and www.highcountrytek.com.
 Business Segments
 Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we are now organized into two operating and reporting segments: Hydraulics and Electronics.  The Hydraulics segment consists of all of the historical Sun Hydraulics companies globally.  Nearly all of the Electronics segment consists of the recently acquired Enovation Controls business. Financial information about our business segments is presented in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  
Hydraulics
 Over the past 47 years, the Hydraulics segment has provided global capital goods industries with hydraulic components and systems used to transmit power and control force, speed and motion. Our products typically add a fine degree of precision and safety to the machinery and equipment in which they are used.
 Sun’s hydraulics products are sold globally through a combination of wholly-owned companies, representative sales offices and independent, authorized distributors.  Activities at Sun companies and sales offices include technical support, inventory warehousing, distributor management and custom manifold design and manufacturing. Our global distribution network includes representation in almost all industrialized markets. Distributors are the local experts in our products.  They typically hold local inventory and transact all business with customers. 
 On a component level, the Hydraulics segment designs and manufactures screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves, manifolds, and integrated fluid power packages and subsystems. Our products provide an important function within a hydraulic system: to control rates and direction of fluid flow and to regulate and control pressures.
 Our screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves use a fundamentally different design platform compared to most other competitive product offerings, which are often referred to as industry common products. The floating construction that we pioneered results in a self-alignment characteristic that provides performance and reliability advantages compared to most competitors’ product offerings. This floating construction differentiates our products from those of most of our competitors, who design and manufacture rigid screw-in cartridge valves that fit a common cavity.  Our cartridge valves, offered in five size ranges and including both electrically actuated and non-electrically actuated products, were designed to be able to operate reliably at higher pressures, making them equally suitable for both industrial and mobile applications.  Sun’s product development approach yields a product line of extreme breadth and depth compared to our competitors.  Our broad scope of product offering, coupled with the high performance characteristics of our cartridge valves, makes Sun a leader in our industry. 
 To fully leverage our cartridge product family, we routinely compete in the manifold and custom integrated package market. A manifold is a solid block of metal, usually aluminum or ductile iron, which is machined to create threaded cavities and channels into which screw-in cartridge valves can be installed and through which the hydraulic fluid flows.  These products allow customers to easily integrate our screw-in cartridge valves into their machinery and equipment. Once designed, standard manifolds require minimal, if any, maintenance engineering over the life of the product and can be manufactured at each of our manufacturing operations. An integrated package consists of multiple cartridge valves assembled into a custom designed manifold for a specific customer to provide the specific operating characteristics of a customer’s circuit.  Because of the unique nature of our cartridge valve designs, manifolds may be designed and machined to make them up to 50% smaller when compared to manifolds that use only industry common cartridge valves.

Additionally, we have internally-developed proprietary expert system software that we use to manufacture custom manifolds efficiently in low volumes. Integrated packages provide many benefits to end users and equipment manufacturers, including reduced assembly time, order simplification, reduced leakage points, aesthetics, potentially fewer hose and fitting connections, and more control functions in a single location.
 In recent years, we have aggressively expanded our offering of electrically-actuated cartridge valves with design technology developed by HCT.  Our design approach has allowed us to quickly offer a full range of electrically-actuated cartridge valves, helping to increase the competiveness of our integrated package offerings. Because hydraulics systems are increasingly taking signals from on-board electronic control systems, it is necessary for hydraulic products to be capable of digital communication.  
 We do not warrant our products for use in any of the following applications, (i) any product that comes under the Federal Highway Safety Act, such as steering or braking systems for passenger-carrying vehicles or on-highway trucks, (ii) aircraft or space vehicles, (iii) ordnance equipment, (iv) life support equipment, and (v) any product that, when sold, would be subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
 Electronics
 Sun, through our HCT brand, designs and manufactures electronic controllers, which manage the function of electrically actuated hydraulic components. HCT’s products range from simple one valve, manually adjusted controllers to fully integrated hydraulic control systems managing multiple hydraulic valves as well as other input and output products such as joysticks and displays. All controllers are potted and therefore impervious to outside influence, making them ideal for mobile, industrial and marine applications.
 In 2016 we acquired Enovation Controls to further develop our digital and electronic capabilities in accordance with our strategy.  A portion of the product portfolio offered by Enovation Controls serves end markets also served by our Hydraulics segment such as off-highway vehicles including construction, agricultural and utility vehicles as well as material handling equipment.  However, the majority of Enovation’s products are sold into end markets not historically served by our Hydraulics segment such as marine, power generation and recreational vehicles.  This provides additional diversification of Sun’s customer base. 
 Globally, electronics products are sold primarily direct to customers, with a small portion sold through independent, authorized distributors.  End markets within the Electronics segment are divided into two lines of business: Power Controls (“PC”) and Vehicle Technologies (“VT”).  PC serves a variety of end markets, some of which are outlined below, with products such as displays, panels, gauges, controllers, battery chargers and various end devices.  VT serves the recreational vehicles end market with products such as electronic controls, displays and instrumentation. 
 Power Controls 
 For the off-highway market, Enovation Controls offers rugged and reliable instruments, coupled with expertise in J1939 engine protocol, to produce an industry-leading array of easy-to-read displays and gauges for controller area network (CAN) transmitted engine data and faults. Our PowerView™ system goes a step further with even more focus on the operator interface: larger, full-graphic displays; flexible hardware configurations; multi-language support; class-leading environmental protection; and software tools that deliver the ultimate solution for OEM display customization and CAN control.  Product categories include traditional mechanical and electronic gauge instrumentation, plug and go CAN-based instruments, after-market support through global distribution, complete, custom panel and console offerings, engineering and application specialists, 3D solid modeling, proprietary hardware and software development and wiring harness design and manufacturing.
 For the agricultural market, Enovation provides a compact, customizable, all-in-one unit that meets the needs of engine-driven pumping equipment applications. Using dedicated microprocessor-based, single engine controllers, we offer field-adjustable operating parameters that can be changed without the need for a computer. Enovation Controls' controllers are built tough with the ability to withstand a wide ambient temperature range. Some of them come standard in a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 4 rated enclosure secured by four rubber shock mounts.  Enovation Controls' products are a tested solution for pumps and irrigation.

For the panel solutions market, we offer top-quality design and simple, turnkey solutions. Our Industrial Panel Division offers engineers dedicated to applications, wire harnesses, panels and software development. Engineers focus entirely on custom and standard solutions built to desired specifications.  Our services go beyond design and development including on-site installation and testing with reviews to ensure the solution works with the application out of the box.  
 Enovation Controls consistently sets and meets specification standards that are rarely matched by our competitors. Our solutions are designed to work in a variety of harsh environments: wet or dry, hot or cold, dirt or mud. Many of our products offer protection for extreme heat and cold, environmental sealing and water resistance.  In order to ensure durability across a wide range of environmental conditions, we perform extensive testing on each instrument that comes off our assembly lines so they are ready to meet the most demanding applications.
 We also offer a full line of products for the commercial marine market as boat builders move towards a more integrated solution approach. We provide instrumentation and control solutions for applications in the commercial marine market from fishing vessels and tugboats to offshore drilling workboats.

Strategy
 In November of 2016, we announced our 2025 Vision for Sun.  We believe we can reach sales of $1 billion by 2025 with $500 million achieved organically and $500 million from acquisitions.  We will seek acquisition targets which will bring us advanced technologies in the industrial goods sector.  Targets must contribute to maintaining Sun’s superior profitability and financial strength long-term.  This is imperative to creating lasting shareholder value.  Our current initiatives for organic growth include new product development to expand our electro-hydraulic product offering, penetrating new geographic markets, expanding sales and marketing efforts in existing geographies and developing new channels to market to reach customers not currently in Sun’s purview. 

Sun’s strategic roadmap includes product and service differentiation, disciplined and thoughtful leadership throughout our global organization and ensuring that all processes and activities consider the view of the customer.  We have identified and have begun applying several tactics to execute our strategies which include capitalizing on our unique and deeply rooted values, structured human capital development and differentiated engineering for both products and processes.  Internal key performance indicators are used on a daily basis to align our short-term actions with our long-term strategy.
 Engineering
 Engineers play an important role in all aspects of our business, including design, manufacturing, sales, marketing and technical support. Engineers work within a disciplined set of design parameters that encourage the repeated incorporation of existing parts into new products. Engineers work closely with manufacturing personnel to define the processes required to manufacture products reliably and consistently.
 Both of our segments have manufacturing engineers who are responsible for evaluating and changing manufacturing processes as well as implementing lean initiatives throughout global operations.   
 Hydraulics
 Our Hydraulics segment engineers are comprised of two distinct groups: sustaining and innovation.  The sustaining engineering group focuses on improving existing products, both from a design as well as a manufacturing perspective including optimizing manufacturing costs.  The innovation engineering group is responsible for new product development and evaluating future needs, from a product perspective, of the hydraulics industry.

Electronics
 Our Electronics segment engineers are comprised of four distinct groups: R&D, application, software and sales.  Engineering of new products is often very fast paced and is completed in a collaborative manner with each original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) based on product release date.  All engineering groups have significant interface with the customer which enables them to understand market demands and identify opportunities for technological advancement, driving market share gains.   
 New product development generally starts in the VT line of business, driven by the need for innovative products by VT customers.  Once products are released and in use by VT customers, they become available for sale to PC customers as well.  
 Manufacturing
 Hydraulics
 We utilize a process intensive manufacturing operation that makes extensive use of automated handling and assembly technology (including robotics) where possible to perform repetitive tasks, thus promoting manufacturing efficiencies and workplace safety. We are somewhat vertically integrated and have the capability to manufacture many of the parts that go into our products, although the majority of unfinished parts are purchased from trusted suppliers.  We control most critical finishing processes in-house but rely on a small network of outside manufacturers to machine cartridge parts to varying degrees of completeness. Many high-volume machining operations are performed exclusively at outside suppliers. We are selective in establishing our supplier base and attempts to develop and maintain long-term relationships with suppliers.
 At our U.S. manufacturing plants, we have extensive testing facilities that allow us to test fully all cartridge valve products. Smaller testing facilities are also available in our manufacturing plants located in the UK, Germany and Korea.  A metallurgist and complete metallurgical laboratory support our design engineers and in-house heat treatment.
 We hold minimal finished goods inventory, typically at our overseas facilities, and rely on our distributors to purchase and maintain sufficient inventory to meet customers’ demands. Most raw materials, including aluminum and steel, are delivered on a just-in-time basis. These and other raw materials are commercially available from multiple sources.
 We continually review all of our suppliers to improve the quality of incoming parts and to assess opportunities for better control of both price and quality. Our quality systems at our U.S. facilities are in compliance with ISO 9001:2008 for design, manufacture, and distribution of high performance screw-in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds used to control force, speed and motion in fluid power systems. Those in the U.K. are certified to ISO 9001:2008 for the design and manufacture of aluminum and ferrous manifold bodies, hydraulic control valves and cartridge valves.  Quality systems in Germany are certified to ISO 9001:2008 for the design, distribution and manufacturing of hydraulic components for mobile and industrial applications.  Finally, quality systems in Korea are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004 for the design, development, production and servicing of hydraulic valves.
 Electronics
 We offer a wide range of advanced manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including mechanical and electronic hardware design, software design, product testing, in-house LCD bonding, panel and harness engineering and more.  State-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities include surface mount technology, x-ray inspection and LCD bonding. Multipoint functional testing delivers higher quality products for our customers.  We are a project-based organization, backed by vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. 
 7


A global integrated operating system, which utilizes intelligent approaches like lean manufacturing and six sigma for maximum productivity, allows us to identify and remove variables in our manufacturing and business processes. By pinpointing areas for improvement, we are able to provide our customers with faster delivery time and higher quality products.  
 Our facilities feature focused in-house cells dedicated to specific product production, such as Surface-mount Technology (SMT), Panel, Wire and Sheet Metal.  Testing on a product specific basis is performed in these cells before manufacturing can be completed.  LCD bonding is performed in-house and allows for complete bonding of the LCD to the glass in order to provide long-term durability without yellowing, delamination or degradation. 
 We hold significant raw materials and finished goods inventory in our Tulsa, OK facility.  Finished goods inventory contains high demand items which require quick delivery.  Raw materials inventory generally has fairly significant lead times, therefore raw material inventory is held in significant quantities to enable us to fulfill orders based on customer request dates which are often less than three weeks.  
 Enovation Controls is an ISO9001:2008 certified company.  The business encompasses the design, manufacture and sale of rugged instrumentation, panels, displays, and electronic control solutions for engines and engine-driven equipment serving the commercial, industrial and recreational markets.
 Sales and Marketing
 Hydraulics
 Hydraulic products are sold globally, primarily through independent fluid power distributors. Technical support is provided by experts based at each of our operations (U.S., England, Germany, Korea, India and China).
 We currently have 86 distributors, 55 of which are located outside the United States and a majority of which have strong technical backgrounds or capabilities, which enable them to develop practical, efficient, and cost-effective fluid power systems for their customers. In 2016, sales to our largest distributor represented less than 6% of the consolidated net sales of our Hydraulics segment.  We sell approximately 20% of our products directly to OEMs, primarily located outside the US.
 In addition to distributors, we sell directly to other companies within the hydraulics industry, including competitors, which incorporate our products into their hydraulic products or systems. We believe that making it easy for other manufacturers to buy our products provides them with a better alternative than developing competing products themselves.  
 We provide end users with technical information through Sun’s website and catalogues in multiple languages, including all information necessary to specify and obtain our products. We believe this approach helps stimulate demand for our products.  
 Electronics
 Electronic products are sold globally, primarily to OEM customers.  Building strong partnerships with OEMs is a priority.  24-hour customer service support and an in-house technical service department is available before, during and after the initial sale to create sustainable partnerships with our customers.  
 Our VT line of business sells products to a small group of large OEM’s, whereas the PC line of business sells products to a large number of customers of varying sizes.  Overall, approximately 10% of total VT & PC sales are derived from independent, authorized distributors.
 We rely on direct customer contacts to stimulate demand for our products.  We work closely with our customers to design and deliver innovative reliable products for specific applications.

Competition
 Hydraulics
 Competitors in the hydraulics market are broken down into three categories:  full-line hydraulics system producers, cartridge valve only producers, and low cost producers. Most competitors market globally.  Full-line producers have the ability to provide complete hydraulic systems to their customers, including component functionally similar to those manufactured by Sun.  Cartridge valve only producers are like Sun in that they only offer cartridge valves and integrated packages, while additional parts of the hydraulics system are obtained from other manufacturers.  Low cost producers are competitors who have emerged in low cost production areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe. These competitors will typically copy both our products and like products designed by competitors to fit industry common cavities. Low cost producers typically have a limited product range compared to full line or cartridge valve only producers which also limits the opportunities for which they can attack competitors. 
 We believe that we compete based upon the quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics of our products and services.
 Electronics
 Competition within the electronics market is very broad with competitors ranging from large multi-national companies with a full electronics offering to small niche companies who specialize in one product type.  Enovation is a niche player in the displays, gauges and instrumentation panel markets. 
 The market for Power Controls and Vehicle Technologies is relatively fragmented with the top 4-6 companies comprising 70% of the market, mostly servicing the automotive space.  Enovation differentiates itself through product quality, customization ability and service with a focus on low volume niche markets which are not well served by the large competitors. 
 Our overall position in our key markets is defensible due to high barriers to switching suppliers, such as up front engineering and programming costs, and positive perceptions among core customers on key selection criteria, including quality and service. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,100 full-time employees with 930 in the Americas, 120 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 50 in Asia Pacific.  No employees are represented by a union in any of our operating units, and we believe that relations with our employees are good. 
Patents and Trademarks
 In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses.  We believe that the growth of our business is dependent upon the quality and functional performance of our products and our relationship with the marketplace, rather than on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.  
Available Information
 Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other materials which are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are made available, free of charge, on or through the Sun website under the heading “Investor Relations - SEC Filings,” as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
