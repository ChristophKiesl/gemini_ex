Overview
Founded in 2014, Science 37 pioneered the concept of patient-centric clinical trials with a very simple premise: that clinical trials should begin with the patient. 
Through its patient-centric approach, Science 37 reduces the impact of the geographic barriers associated with conventional physical clinical trial sites, enabling recruitment of virtually any patient. Science 37 believes that centering the clinical trial around the patient with personalized support addresses current industry needs around patient recruitment, retention, representation, and engagement. To expand clinical trial access Science 37 offers a unique model to existing non-research focused healthcare networks to seamlessly participate without the traditional site infrastructure costs.
Science 37’s patient-centric model is powered by a proprietary end-to-end unified technology platform and its team of approximately 460 employees with significant therapeutic and subject matter expertise. As the backbone of Science 37’s offering, the proprietary unified technology platform standardizes and orchestrates the process for clinical trials across Science 37’s specialized network of patient communities, telemedicine investigators, flexible mobile nurse networks, remote coordinators, and robust network of technology integrations.
Our Market
Science 37 is addressing a market that it believes is ripe for disruption, with the clinical trial model having been largely unchanged over the past 60 to 90 years. The traditional clinical trial model relies on a network of physical clinical research sites for trial execution, requiring patients to travel to a site for each visit. Due to geographical limitations of centralized sites, only an estimated 8% of patients are approached to join a clinical trial because most do not live near a participating research site. About 30% of the patients recruited do not complete the full study. In addition to increased patient burden, the site-centric traditional clinical trial has given rise to a myriad of operational challenges, including slow start up, poor enrollment, high patient drop-out rates, and lack of diversity, all of which negatively impact timelines to launch life-saving drug treatments for patients. In the end, approximately 80% of trials experience delays, 94% of them greater than one month, resulting in prolonged timelines of up to 13 years to launch drug treatments globally.
Global annual research and development spending has increased from $52.1 billion in 2000 to current annual spending of approximately $252 billion, growing at a 7.1% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”). Based on its management team’s experience and knowledge of this market, Science 37 estimates that approximately 52% of this spending will be outsourced, resulting in a serviceable available market of approximately $131 billion. Science 37 expects this serviceable available market (“SAM”) to grow at an approximate 6% CAGR over the next five years. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the General Economic and Financial Market Conditions and the Industries in which Science 37 Operates — Science 37’s estimate of the market size for its products and services may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market size is accurate, there can be no assurance that its business will serve a significant portion of the market.”

Our Offerings
Science 37 derives its revenue primarily from two sources: (i) contractual arrangements to enable and enhance clinical trials through technology and/or services (Full DCT and Metasite), and (ii) licensing of its proprietary Technology Platform to a variety of life science institutions. Science 37 focuses on four offerings, all with Science 37’s unified technology platform serving as the foundation:
1.Full Decentralized Clinical Trial. In this offering, Science 37 is the sole provider delivering for a sponsor. Science 37 is performing the entire clinical trial on its technology platform, including orchestrating all the visits and activities.
2.Metasite. In this case, Science 37 acts as a virtual site to supplement a network of traditional sites. Science 37 leverages its technology platform and orchestrates the clinical trial but is responsible for only a portion of the total patients associated with a clinical trial.
3.Hybrid Clinical Trials. In this offering, Science 37 leverages its virtual site technology and services to digitize a portion of the visits conducted on a trial, enabling sponsors and CROs to conduct hybrid trials with portions of the trial visits being conducted virtually.
4.Technology. Science 37 is not conducting the trial, nor is it a Metasite, but configures the technology to support patient engagement, remote eConsent, eSource (eCOA, eCRF), telemedicine and/or third party integrations as part of a broader trial solution. Science 37 has a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) option should the sponsor or CRO wish to deploy the technology themselves.

Customers
The configurability of the Science 37 offerings allows Science 37 to meet the needs of each customer in a customized manner. Science 37’s platform accounts for the trial design, number of participants, therapeutic area, study complexity and use of home visits and electronic assessments for remote data capture. Science 37 is recognized as the leader in patient-centric clinical trial solutions among its customers, providing a leading offering, rooted in strong experience, and an architect of the future clinical trial design.
Science 37’s customers consist of large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, biotech customers, CROs as well as academic institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer individually represented greater than 10% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three customers each individually represented greater than 10% of revenue. 
The majority of Science 37’s contracts with its customers range in duration from a few months to several years. Science 37 generally receives compensation based on measuring progress toward completion using anticipated project budgets and direct labor and prices for each service offering. In addition, in certain instances, a customer contract may include forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or decrease the transaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. Most of Science 37’s contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a 30-day notice. In the event of termination, Science 37’s contracts generally provide that the customer pay Science 37 for: (i) fees earned through the termination date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures; and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of the remaining professional fees on the project.
Competition
Science 37 competes at the intersection of companies that orchestrate clinical trials and companies with technology to support the orchestration of clinical trials.
Along the clinical trial orchestration dimension, the primary market participants are CROs, Sites, and site network commonly referred to as Site Management Organizations or SMOs. 
CROs are typically engaged by trial sponsors to manage and facilitate the full trial. CROs then contract with Sites and SMOs to enroll and manage patients along the trials schedule of assessments. To ensure quality and compliance CROs send monitors site monitors called Clinical Research Associates to the Sites or SMOs physical locations to ensure quality and compliance in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”). While some CROs refer to Science 37 as a competitor, Science 37 views CROs as partners and a sales channel. 
Sites and SMOs predominantly execute traditional clinical trials where a patient is required to come to the physical location for all the visits outlined on the schedule of assessments. The current method of executing at a traditional site or SMOs requires a set of SOPs that are custom fit for each sites operations and are largely heterogeneous from other sites. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these SOPs sponsors require CROs to monitor traditional Site and SMOs operations for quality and compliance. Alternatively, Science 37’s approach to patient-centric clinical trials requires a significantly different set SOPs than those that are utilized at a traditional site or SMOs. The set of proprietary SOPs outline processes for conducting patient-centric clinical trials utilizing Science 37’s proprietary technology platform to execute clinical trials in compliance with GCP. Science 37’s SOPs enables CROs to leverage Science 37’s offerings to help manage the shift in the industry to more patient-centric, remote, and decentralized trials.
Alternatively, eClinical companies are focused on making the traditional site model more efficient. Many of these companies have unique capabilities that can plug into Science 37’s technology stack and, as such, have become partners, including physIQ Inc, Signant Health, ERT and Ai Cure.
There are emerging players that have less developed orchestration and technology capabilities that are trying to emulate the Science 37 model; however, they are several years behind Science 37 and do not possess the same scale.
Social Responsibility
Social responsibility is core to Science 37’s mission-oriented corporate culture. Science 37 was founded to address structural hurdles in today’s clinical landscape that drive low patient and provider participation and result in slow timelines in getting life-changing therapies to market. Science 37’s model is designed to empower the patient while deeply engaging the clinical trial team of investigators, nurses, and coordinators, in order to disrupt the traditional trial delivery system and ultimately drive better outcomes.

Quality
Science 37 is profoundly dedicated to providing the highest level of clinical and operational quality. In Science 37’s culture of quality, every employee is dedicated to protecting and improving the experience of all stakeholders (patients, providers, CROs, sponsors and more) in clinical research. Quality is woven into every step - what Science 37 calls the ‘Science 37 Way’ - to ensure that trial planning and conduct meet Science 37’s commitments to all stakeholders from initial contact of a prospective sponsor to the final closeout of a study.
Contact to Kickoff: From the moment of first contact with a prospective sponsor through the deal process, and project initiation, Science 37’s team of subject matter experts, including medical directors, therapeutic heads, technologists, clinical operations and procurement, undertake in-depth and detailed solutioning for each project. To minimize risk and ensure confidence and quality, Science 37 accounts for its previous learnings, leveraging its knowledge base around best practices by phase, therapeutic area and protocol construct. Science 37 conducts risk planning from the onset, outlining assumptions, potential risks, and detailed mitigation plans, which Science 37 corroborates with its customers during a highly formalized kickoff meeting to ensure alignment, minimize ambiguity and forge a partnership in support of quality.
Kickoff to Conduct: After a formal kickoff meeting, as Science 37 prepares for project initiation, its cross-functional team works in lockstep to ensure they plan across every dimension. Science 37 develops project-specific execution plans to ensure alignment and proper escalation paths, and tracks progress against predefined operational and quality metrics. Science 37 leverages tools that reflect its experience in delivery, such as its detailed RACIs responsibility assignment matrices and step-by-step operational flows, which enable it to startup trials efficiently, in compliance and in accordance with its customer kickoff discussions. As part of conduct readiness, Science 37 Study Teams undergo training on all its SOPs, International Conference on Council for Harmonization (“ICH”) GCP guidelines, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations, data privacy, diversity and any other applicable topics related to both broader trial conduct and study-specific conduct. Additional periodic training is conducted to ensure comprehension. Science 37 investigators are board-certified in their chosen therapeutic specialties and have appropriate medical licensure and certifications. All Science 37 investigators go through rigorous investigator onboarding and training on company SOPs, GCP/ICH guidelines, FDA and other applicable regulations. Similar certification is required of Science 37’s nursing network, and similar training is required across all other trial team roles.
Conduct to Closeout: In the third and final stage, Science 37 follows its detailed SOPs to ensure it stays compliant and can pivot as the trial progresses. Patient safety remains Science 37’s top priority. Science 37’s policies govern how it operates in all patient-centric touchpoints, particularly in the development of its technology platform and conduct of research; regular training for its employees ensures compliance with these processes. Science 37 is governed by a holistic Quality Management System (“QMS”) that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 820 Subpart B - Quality System Requirements.

Government Regulation
Regulation of Clinical Trials
The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is sought, before a marketing application for a product candidate is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the product candidate must undergo rigorous testing in 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the product candidate to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.
In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. Within the European Union (“EU”), clinical trial requirements are enforced by the EU Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014 harmonizing the processes for assessment and supervision of clinical trials throughout the EU. The evaluation, authorization and supervision of clinical trials are the responsibility of the EU Member States and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). In the United Kingdom (“UK”), clinical trial requirements are enforced by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) under the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions where Science 37 operates or where its customers intend to apply for marketing authorization.
Some of these regulations apply directly to Science 37, as a clinical trial operator; others apply to Science 37’s customers, as pharmaceutical companies, and contractually to Science 37 as their service provider.
Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might differ from the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other materials. FDA laws and regulations may apply to clinical studies conducted outside the United States if, for example, such studies are conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”). It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
Science 37’s services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, Science 37 must perform its clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice. The industry standard for the conduct of clinical trials is embodied in the FDA’s regulations for an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), investigators and sponsor/monitors, regulations collectively termed GCP by industry, and the GCP guidelines issued by the ICH of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, which have been agreed upon by industry and regulatory representatives from the United States, the European Union, and Japan. GCP requirements address, among other things, IRBs, qualified investigators, informed consent, recordkeeping and reporting. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections. Violations of GCP requirements could result in enforcement actions including the issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, product recalls, criminal prosecutions or debarment, suspension or exclusion from involvement in future clinical trials or the submission of pre-market approval applications. Science 37 monitors its clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. Science 37 has adopted SOPs that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of its clinical trials. We have adopted SOPs that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated requirements. Science 37 must also maintain reports in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for each study for auditing or inspection by the customer and regulatory authorities.
Prior to commencing human clinical trials, a company developing a new drug must file an IND with the FDA or, in the case of certain new devices, an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”). The IND or IDE must include information about pre-clinical tests, chemistry, manufacturing and control data, and a study protocol for the proposed clinical trial of the drug or device in humans. If the FDA does not object in writing within 30 days after filing, the IND or IDE becomes effective and the clinical trial may begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IND or IDE for which modification is required, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND or IDE therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin or continue a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND or IDE must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with an effective IND or IDE.
Clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of an IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review, approval, and monitoring, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. In some cases, an IND or IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a

sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, sponsors of clinical trials must, among other things:
•comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
•obtain specific written commitments from the investigators;
•obtain review, approval and supervision of clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;
•obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
•verify that appropriate patient informed consent is obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
•ensure adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
•monitor the quality, validity and accuracy of data;
•maintain records regarding drug or biologic dispensing and disposition;
•verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports; and
•permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
In operating clinical trials on behalf of sponsors, Science 37 is required, either by contract or direct regulation, to comply with these requirements as well. Science 37 may be subject to regulatory action if it fails to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. If a clinical trial is not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the applicable regulatory agency may require that a clinical trial be modified, suspended or terminated, and Science 37 or its customers may be subject to a variety of enforcement actions. For example, violations could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter; suspension or termination of a clinical study; refusal of the FDA to authorize a sponsor to proceed under an IND or IDE for a clinical trial; refusal of the FDA to approve marketing applications, or withdrawal of such marketing applications; injunction, seizure of investigational products; civil penalties; criminal prosecutions; or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. IRBs may also suspend or terminate research not conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Regulation of Personal Information
Science 37 holds confidential personal health and other information relating to persons who have been, are and may in the future be involved in clinical trials or otherwise. The collection, possession, retention, use, transmission and disclosure of such information is highly regulated, both in the United States and the other jurisdictions where Science 37 operates, and Science 37 is subject to Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and all regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003, among others. Additionally, Science 37 may be subject to State-level privacy, security and breach notification and healthcare information laws, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Depending on the services provided, Science 37’s operations outside the United States may be subject to privacy regulations and laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union, the UK’s data protection regime consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UK GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 or the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) in Canada. Such laws and regulations may place restrictions or conditions on the export of personal data outside their applicable geographies, and/or impose additional requirements on service providers. In particular, the GDPR and UK GDPR include obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of

the EEA or UK (respectively), security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater. Additionally, the UK GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or GBP 17.5 million, whichever is greater. European and UK data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws (including the UK GDPR) differently and impose additional requirements, which contributes to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA and/or UK. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices is often updated or otherwise revised.
Other Regulations
The foregoing descriptions do not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. Science 37 also must comply with other related international, federal, state and local regulations that govern the practice of medicine (by trial investigators) and nursing (by mobile research nurses), as well as regulations that apply to employers and businesses generally, including, but not limited to, labor and employment and tax laws.
Any failure on Science 37’s part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research, the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, fines and other sanctions, as well as liability to Science 37’s customers. Furthermore, any issuance of a notice of finding by a governmental authority against either Science 37 or its customers, based upon a material violation by Science 37 of any applicable regulation, could materially and adversely affect Science 37’s reputation and business. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate or failure to comply with such legislation and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business.
