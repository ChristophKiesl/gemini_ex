Item 1. Business
General
Donaldson Company, Inc. (the Company) was founded in 1915. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1936.
The Company is a global manufacturer of filtration systems and replacement parts. The Company’s core strengths include leading filtration technology, strong customer relationships and its global presence. Products are manufactured and sold around the world. Products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, dealers and directly to end users.
The Company’s operating segments are Engine Products and Industrial Products. The Engine Products segment consists of replacement filters for both air and liquid filtration applications, air filtration systems, liquid filtration systems for fuel, lube and hydraulic applications, exhaust and emissions systems and sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. The Engine Products segment sells to OEMs in the construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense and transportation end markets and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts and large fleets. The Industrial Products segment consists of dust, fume and mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, gas and liquid filtration for food, beverage and industrial processes, air filtration systems for gas turbines, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane-based products and specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including hard disk drives and semi-conductor manufacturing and sensors, indicators and monitoring systems. The Industrial Products segment sells to various dealers, distributors, OEMs and end users.
The Company’s results of operations are affected by conditions in the global economic and geopolitical environment. Under most economic conditions, the Company’s market diversification between its diesel engine end markets, its global end markets, its diversification through technology and its OEM and replacement parts customers has helped to limit the impact of weakness in any one product line, market or geography on the consolidated operating results of the Company.

The information contained on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered to be part of this report.
Seasonality
A number of the Company’s end markets are dependent on the construction, agricultural and power generation industries, which are generally stronger in the second half of the Company’s fiscal year. The first two quarters of the fiscal year also contain more holiday periods, which typically include more customer plant closures. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had a greater impact on the first two quarters of fiscal 2021, with improving conditions in the second half of fiscal 2021.
Competition
Principal methods of competition in both the Engine Products and Industrial Products segments are technology, innovation, price, geographic coverage, service and product performance. The Company participates in a number of highly competitive filtration markets in both segments. The Company believes it is a market leader within many of its product lines, specifically within its Off-Road and On-Road product lines for OEMs and in the Aftermarket for replacement filters. The Engine Products segment’s principal competitors include several large global competitors and many regional competitors, especially in the Aftermarket business. The Industrial Products segment’s principal competitors vary from country to country and range from large global competitors to a significant number of smaller competitors who compete in a specific geographical region or in a limited number of product applications.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials that the Company uses are steel, filter media and petrochemical-based products including plastic, rubber and adhesives products. Purchased raw materials represent approximately 65% of the Company’s cost of sales. 
Intellectual Property
The Company owns a broad range of intellectual property rights relating to its products and services, which it considers in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset. These include patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States (U.S.) and a number of foreign countries. The Company protects its innovations arising from research and development through patent filings and owns a portfolio of issued patents, including utility and design patents. The Company also owns various trademarks related to its products and services including Donaldson® and the turbo D logo, Ultra-Web®, PowerCore®, Downflo®, Torit® and Synteq® XP, among others. No single intellectual property right is responsible for protecting the Company’s products. 
Backlog
Backlog is one of many indicators of business conditions in the Company’s markets. However, it is not always indicative of future results for a number of reasons, including the timing of the receipt of orders, as well as product mix. Backlog orders expected to be delivered within 90 days as of July 31, 2021 and 2020 were $626.0 million and $362.4 million, respectively. Backlog increased 84.8% for the Engine Products segment and 47.4% for the Industrial Products segment. Backlog increased primarily as the result of higher demand for the Company’s products and production lead times.
Research and Development
During the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company spent $67.8 million, $61.2 million and $62.3 million, respectively, on research and development activities, which was 2.4%, 2.4% and 2.2% of net sales, respectively. Research and development expenses include scientific research costs such as salaries, facility costs, testing, technical information technology and administrative expenditures as well as an allocation of corporate costs. Research and development expenses are for the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved products and their uses. Substantially all research and development is performed in-house.
