Item 1. Business
​
Overview
​
Teladoc Health, Inc. is the largest and most trusted global leader of comprehensive virtual healthcare services. We are forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes and value. Our mission is to empower all people everywhere to live their healthiest lives by transforming the healthcare experience. Our vision is to position virtual care as the first place consumers go to get the care they need and manage their health. For whatever healthcare needs a consumer has, across any site of care, we aim to provide the right level of personalized support to meet that need. We believe that favorable existing macro trends were accelerated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, driving greater consumer trial and use of virtual care, and increased adoption by employers, health plans, hospitals and health systems, and health care providers. In combination with the expansion of our capabilities, we believe that these trends present significant opportunities for virtual healthcare to address the most pressing, universal healthcare challenges through trusted solutions, such as ours, that deliver convenient, high quality care; empower consumers to manage and improve their health; and enable providers to offer their best care for their patients. Our Clients consist of employers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500, health plans, health systems, and insurance and financial services companies (Clients).
​
We will achieve this by delivering, enabling and empowering integrated whole-person virtual care services and
experiences that span every stage of the health journey, with a portfolio of services and solutions covering hundreds of medical subspecialties from non-urgent, episodic needs like flu and upper respiratory infections, to chronic, complicated medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, cancer and congestive heart failure. By combining the latest in data science and analytics with an award-winning user experience through a highly flexible technology platform, we completed approximately 10.6 million telehealth visits in 2020 through our network of providers while our licensed platform enabled our Clients’ own clinicians to provide approximately 2.1 million visits for their own patients around the globe, including InTouch platform-enabled sessions from the date of acquisition on July 1, 2020. 

​
Over 51 million unique U.S. paid Members (Members) and 22 million visit fee only individuals have access to our high-quality healthcare and expertise, including 0.6 million Members with access to one or more of our chronic care solutions. We provide access to healthcare through our portfolio of consumer brands 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. Our solutions are delivered with an approximate median response time of less than ten minutes for 2020 in the U.S. for general medical inquiries from the time a Member requests a general medical telehealth visit to the time they consult with a Teladoc Health network provider.
​
During 2020 we merged with Livongo, the leader in digital chronic condition management solutions for employers and health plans. Livongo empowers people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives, beginning with diabetes and now including hypertension, weight management, diabetes prevention, and mental health. The total consideration was $13,938.0 million, consisting of $401.0 million of net cash, $555.4 million related to the conversion feature of the Livongo Notes guaranteed by the Company and 60.4 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $12,981.6 million. In 2020 we also acquired InTouch, the leader in providing scalable, integrated virtual care solutions to hospitals, health systems, and other provider entities, for aggregate consideration of $1,069.8 million, which was comprised of 4.6 million shares of our common stock valued at $903.3 million, and $166.5 million of net cash. 
​
The merger with Livongo has positioned us to offer integrated, comprehensive Whole Person solutions that we believe will meet the current and future needs of our Clients and Members. By bringing together leaders in virtual health and chronic condition management, we believe that the merger combines comprehensive clinical expertise with a rich technology and data-driven experience; prevention and chronic condition management with acute and specialty care; behavior change expertise with data science; global footprint with products meeting global need; access with innovation and two of the fastest growing companies in health technology. The combined company’s platform features the full range of health support – from AI engine-driven “nudges” and health coaches to therapists and board-certified physicians and the world’s leading specialists – available anytime, anywhere to ensure the right care is always delivered. We believe 

2



that delivering Whole Person care as a comprehensive partner with a patient and health system will drive better health and cost outcomes and fundamentally change how patients access and experience healthcare, and the combination of our data scale, technology and clinical capabilities with Livongo’s technology and data insights will underpin the combined company’s ability to deliver differentiated care. We further believe that our significant Member scale and millions of annual visits will increase enrollment and utilization across the combined company's solutions as well as amplify overall engagement retention.
​
The Teladoc Health Brand Portfolio 
​
Our consumer brands – Teladoc, Livongo, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp and HealthiestYou - deliver access to advice and resolution for a broad array of healthcare needs, in intuitive, award-winning experiences designed to meet the expectations of today’s consumers, from children to the senior population. The most common way for individuals to request healthcare is by using a mobile device, reflecting the growing consumer adoption of mobile technology and applications in managing their health.
​
Who We Serve
​
We currently provide virtual healthcare services on a business-to-business (B2B) basis to thousands of Clients including employers, health plans, hospitals and health systems, and insurance and financial services companies (Clients) spanning the global healthcare landscape and provide services to consumers directly and through channel partners. In our behavioral health business, including our BetterHelp brand, we serve individuals in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) market and through business partnerships with other trusted brands. Our Clients purchase our solutions to reduce their healthcare spending, or to provide market differentiating services as a part of, or a complement to, their core set of consumer service offerings, while at the same time, offering convenient, affordable, high-quality healthcare to their constituents. On a direct B2B basis, we sell to our Clients who in turn buy our solutions on behalf of their beneficiaries. In our various sales channels, a range of third parties, including health plans, pharmacy benefits managers, financial institutions, brokers, agents, benefits consultants and resellers, sell our solutions to various end markets around the world. Notably, many of our health plan Clients also act as channel partners because they resell our solutions to their Administrative Service Only (ASO) accounts and other customers. Similarly, our financial services Clients act as channel partners, embedding our solutions into a range of insurance, credit card and other financial products.
​
We have over 50 health plan Clients, including some of the largest in the United States. While health plans are Clients, they also serve as distribution channels to self-insured employers that contract with us through our relationships with the health plan. We serve more than 600 hospital and health system Clients and our employer Clients include over 50% of the Fortune 500 companies. The remainder of our Clients are from channel partners such as brokers, resellers and consultants who sell into a range of small, medium and large enterprises.
​
Our virtual solutions delivered through all of our channels offer our Clients proven substantial savings opportunities and an attractive return on investment. We commissioned Veracity Analytics, an independent healthcare data analytics company, to perform a study of several Clients representing nearly two million of our Members as of the end of 2016. To date, we believe this is the most comprehensive study of its kind and the findings remain valid based on our experience with our Clients. The study found that these Clients saved $472 on average per general medical visit when its Members received healthcare through Teladoc Health instead of receiving healthcare in other settings for the same diagnosis. Our chronic care solutions have also been shown to provide significant average cost savings for our Clients, including an average savings of $1,908 per participant per year in our Livongo for Diabetes program.
​
How We Generate Revenue
​
We primarily generate revenue on a contractually recurring, subscription access fee basis, typically on either a per-Member-per-month (PMPM) or per-enrollee-per-month basis (PEPM), and in certain contracts, on a per subscriber basis. In some cases, Clients primarily pay monthly subscription fees based on a per-participant-per-month model, based on the number of active enrolled Members each month. We also generate revenue from health system and provider Clients related to our licensed technology platform, primarily in the form of recurring access fee revenue as well as from the sale and lease of devices such as robots, carts and tablets. 

3



Our access fees comprise the majority of our revenue and therefore provide us with significant revenue visibility. We also generate additional revenue on a per-telehealth visit basis through certain Clients with visit fee only (VFO) arrangements. 
​
For certain Clients, we also earn visit fees or per-case fees in combination with access fees. Access fee services continue to be the most appealing to our Clients due to the proven effectiveness of our engagement science and surround sound strategies driving utilization of our services.
​
Access fees are paid by our Clients on behalf of their employees, dependents, policy holders, card holders, beneficiaries, clinicians, or as is the case with certain of our subscribers, fees are paid by our Members themselves. General medical and other specialty visit fees are paid by Clients and/or Members. 
​
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 79%, 19% and 2% of our revenue was derived from access fees, visit fees and other, respectively. For both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 84% and 16% of our revenue were derived from access fees and visit fees. 
​
Our Competitive Strengths
​
We believe that Teladoc Health is the leading global virtual healthcare provider with strong competitive advantages that address the most pressing challenges and trends in the delivery of healthcare around the world. We believe our history of innovation and long-standing operational excellence provide us with significant first-mover advantages, and we continue to invest and expand our services and geographic footprint globally. As the first comprehensive virtual healthcare provider providing Whole Person care at scale, we have pioneered solutions and created what we believe are collectively the telehealth industry’s first and only offerings of their kind.
​
Comprehensive Suite of Virtual Healthcare Clinical Services
​
We believe that we are the first and only company to provide a comprehensive and integrated Whole Person virtual healthcare solution that both provides and enables a full spectrum of clinical conditions – from wellness, prevention and acute care to chronic conditions and complex healthcare needs – as well as a wide range of services, such as telehealth solutions, chronic condition management, expert medical services, behavioral health solutions, guidance and support, and platform & program services.
​
Global Footprint Spanning Clients, Medical Operations and Members
We believe we have the only global footprint spanning a diverse set of Client channels, medical operations and Members. Combining our suite of international clinical capabilities with our technology and operational scale uniquely equips us to meet the needs of U.S. multinational employers that serve more than one third of their employees who live abroad.
Unmatched Breadth of Solutions for Clients Across All Channels Served 
​
We deliver a comprehensive set of solutions to a diverse Client population through a highly efficient and effective distribution network wherein we reach Clients and consumers on a direct B2B basis through our Clients and channel partners as well on a D2C basis by marketing our solution directly to potential Members. 
​
We believe the breadth of our distribution strategy allows us to directly reach consumers and Clients of nearly every size and in nearly every market. 
​
Comprehensive Engagement Model that Drives Utilization 
​
We believe that our ability to drive behavior change on a global scale to deliver the highest utilization of virtual healthcare services in the industry is a key competitive differentiator for Teladoc Health. We utilize a combination of our 

4



proprietary Engagement Science, our Surround Sound capabilities, personalized consumer experiences as well as our deep knowledge and expertise of various populations to increase the adoption of our virtual care services. 
​
Our Engagement Science is a unique combination of the application of predictive analytics and modeling, our deep experience with all population demographics and expertise in applying this knowledge to our Client populations on a global scale. With our proprietary Engagement Science, we target Members using behavioral triggers, advanced predictive modeling and demographic/firmographic insights. This increases efficiency and the impact of our communications by reaching the right Member, with the right personalized message, in the right micro moments of their day-to-day lives. 
​
We believe that our Surround Sound capabilities are unique in the breadth and scale of media mix, analytics and targeting techniques that we actively deploy across our diverse Client populations on a global scale. We use these capabilities, plus our Engagement Science, to drive awareness and utilization of Teladoc Health services through innovative media strategies designed to reach Members in their homes, on the go and in their moments of need. Our Surround Sound capabilities and strategies are continuously being evaluated, analyzed and evolved to meet ever-shifting consumer behaviors.
​
Highly Scalable and Secure API-Driven Technology Platform
​
Our core platform is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform, for virtual healthcare delivery, with multiple real-time integrations spanning the healthcare ecosystem.
​
It is currently equipped to serve over 100 million Members and can provide the same level of Member support and response time for upwards of 100,000 visits per day. Further, our platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services and products that we have introduced, such as behavioral health, dermatology, nutrition, expert medical opinions, Primary360, global healthcare including our Canadian telehealth program, and other services that are currently in the development stages. 
​
Our core platform leverages proprietary cloud based technology that combines smart connected devices with sophisticated data science to deliver personalized health insights. These insights are delivered to Members at the optimal moment to drive behavior change that drives meaningful improvements in clinical health outcomes, which drives value to the health care ecosystem.
​
Our platform’s APIs power external connectivity and deep integration with a wide range of payors, third party applications and other interfaces which we believe uniquely positions us to be a central partner meeting the unique needs of the rapidly emerging, technology powered healthcare industry.
​
The majority of our application platform technology is cloud based, leveraging scalable and redundant solutions from AWS and Microsoft Azure to ensure high performance and high availability. Due to the sensitive nature of our Members’ and Clients’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have a rigorous and comprehensive information security program managed by a dedicated department of security engineers and analysts. We have implemented telehealth industry standard processes, policies and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third-party penetration testing in order to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. In addition, our enterprise security program is periodically evaluated by expert third parties to ensure we are meeting or exceeding standards, best practices, and regulatory requirements. One example of such an independent third-party certification that we have achieved is HITRUST CSF.
​
For Members enrolled in our diabetes program, we provide a unique and proprietary blood glucose meter. The patented “BG300” device includes FDA Class II certified glucose testing along with a cellular antenna and color touchscreen. Our proprietary software on the device relays the blood glucose measurements and user inputs to our cloud service, and then displays targeted communications and AI-selected “nudges” based on the current context and medical history of the Member. These communications are dynamically personalized and optimized using our AI+AI engine to 

5



deliver improved outcomes. The software on the device can also be remotely upgraded through the cellular antenna to deliver usability improvements and program enhancements. 
​
To meet the growing needs of hospitals and health systems, as well as multi-national insurers, our proprietary licensed platform enables Clients to fully integrate private instances of our platform alongside their traditional modes of delivering healthcare to their patients. Leveraging the flexibility and customization available on the platform, most of these implementations incorporate deep integration with the hospital or health system’s EMR platform for scheduling and bi-directional clinical data sharing.
​
Our unique technology designed for the hospital and health system market is a complete end-to-end telehealth solution, including patient intake, emergent and scheduled encounters, robust televideo sessions, access to medical images, full application-specific clinical documentation tools – including interfaces to health system EMRs, and complete operational and clinical reporting and analytics. The technology also supports industry-leading medical devices such as robots, carts, and tablets in hospital networks via a unique network architecture for maximum performance, reliability and security. The solution supports the entire patient journey and the full range of telehealth use cases encountered by health systems.
 ​
Our industry leading technology includes medical device support and custom purpose built telehealth robots, which are designed to facilitate remote telepresence into high-acuity hospital environments such as emergency rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), surgery suites, etc. These robots provide high-performance low-latency command and control, as well as high-quality televideo and peripheral telemetry, enabling physicians to have an immersive telepresence experience. Applications for telehealth robots include unattended remote round and respond, including in ICUs and other high-acuity environments, surgical mentoring, remote education, and specialist consultations.
​
High-Quality Clinical Capabilities Tailored to Virtual Care 
​
We deliver high-quality clinical care and advice in a virtual setting to our Members through the unique combination of our proprietary guidelines, breadth and depth of clinical quality data, analytics, oversight as well as through our in-house and third-party medical professionals (the Teladoc Health Medical Group). The Medical Group is composed of staff clinicians, our telehealth provider network and our Global Expert Panel. Our Global Expert Panel is composed of a network of over 50,000 clinicians around the world whose specialties span over 450 sub-specialties and are affiliated with some of the most prestigious medical facilities in the world. 
​
To improve the clinical quality our patients receive, we apply analytics to the anonymized data points generated in our millions of visits with patients. These data sets and insights are applied to enhancing our providers’ ability to deliver quality care through tools such as our provider dashboards, as well as serving a foundation for clinical innovation, collaborating with leaders in the space, focused on the advancement of virtual care delivery and practices. 
​
We established the healthcare industry’s first Patient Safety Organization (PSO) dedicated to virtual care with the mission of conducting quality and safety initiatives with and on behalf of key healthcare stakeholders, including other PSOs, to improve the delivery of virtual care across the country. Named “The Institute for Patient Safety and Quality of Virtual Care,” this newly formed component entity of Teladoc Health is formally recognized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and listed and certified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).
​
Our Growth Strategies
​
Enable A Virtual First Strategy for Consumer Healthcare Access
​
Teladoc Health is creating a new virtual front door for consumers to access the healthcare system. Our vision is to position virtual care as the first place consumers go to get the care they need and manage their health. For whatever healthcare needs a consumer has, across any site of care, we aim to provide the right level of personalized support to meet that need. As we drive the world to a “Virtual First” mindset, we believe only Teladoc Health has the enterprise scale, technical capabilities, clinical depth, and consumer engagement expertise to achieve the vision. We refer to Teladoc Health’s integrated offering as our comprehensive Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform. 

6



Teladoc Health’s Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform delivers a single solution leveraging our comprehensive clinical expertise, data, and scale, to address the complete spectrum of conditions from non-critical, episodic care to chronic, complicated cases. The Virtual First model is built on our integrated Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform, combining smart technologies, AI and Machine Learning, rich data exchange, digital self-management tools, integrated remote patient monitoring devices, Analytics, and scalability to streamline care and drive better outcomes. Our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform matches the expectations of today’s digital consumer with a new kind of healthcare experience.
​
Expand our suite of clinical services to address unmet needs 
​
We believe that our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform addresses significant unmet needs, and we intend to continue to expand our solutions across use cases and additional care settings.
​
We are able to offer solutions to our Members globally for a range of critical, life-threatening cases such as cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, inflammatory disorders, heart conditions, chronic pain, and many other chronic, complex, and critical medical issues. 
​
We believe our services have wide applicability across new use cases, including Virtual Primary Care, home care, post discharge, wellness/screening and new areas in chronic care. The Livongo and InTouch solutions acquired in 2020 also incorporate purpose built hardware, software, networking, and services, enabling a range of use cases (e.g., telestroke, telepsychiatry, tele-ICU) and encounter types (e.g., provider to provider, consumer to provider). We will continue to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, including mobile applications, AI and Machine Learning, nutrition and wellness, biometric devices and at-home testing. 
​
Increase Engagement with Our Members by Driving Expanded Access & Enhanced Touch Points
​
We believe there is significant opportunity within our existing Membership base to increase engagement by continually driving awareness of and usage of our solutions. We believe our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform can become the primary entry point for on-demand, virtual healthcare for eligible individuals around the world. We expect to continually refine and enhance our user experience, which is a critical driver of new and repeat engagement and continue validating our Member satisfaction with surveys and other proactive tools. 
​
Our mobile app is foundational for Teladoc Health as we have redefined virtual healthcare delivery and are providing our Members with a better way to navigate their individual care. Our Members benefit from a single, patient-centered point of access to our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform. As we expand the range of products and services available to our Members, such as incorporating Livongo’s chronic condition management solutions, we are investing in a seamless, relevant, and personalized mobile experience that provides smart guidance for our Members. For example, our Health Assistant enables Members to express their healthcare need through a user-friendly, AI-supported and guided interface. Members are then presented with the optimal product or pathway to meet their need. 
​
Our industry leading user interface capabilities and expertise enable unique types of partnerships where our capabilities are delivered to our partners with their brands, logos, and workflows on mobile and web platforms. These integrated Member experience solutions drive higher Member engagement, convenience and utilization. 
​
Expand Penetration Amongst Existing Clients
​
We believe that we offer a highly differentiated suite of solutions for a broad range of market channels, spanning the spectrum of traditional healthcare system participants such as employers, health plans and health systems as well as global financial services businesses and other organizations that have extended their investment in our industry. We plan to execute this strategy by further penetrating existing relationships. Within existing accounts, we believe our current Membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. Our existing health plan Clients and self-insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solutions for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in the aggregate, and we estimate this provides us the opportunity to grow our Membership base by more than 65 million individuals in the United States by expanding our penetration within our existing Clients alone. We 

7



also now have substantial room to drive cross-sell opportunities of Livongo products into Teladoc Health’s existing Client base, as we see less than 25% overlap of our respective existing Client bases.
​
Within the health plan market, a key area for growth is in increasing penetration within government sponsored programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Exchange populations. Virtual healthcare is well positioned to address the cost and access challenges in many of these markets, and we expect Medicare Advantage plans to continue to grow adoption of virtual healthcare into the future. 
​
Leverage Existing Distribution Channels and Expand Penetration of Global Markets
​
We have developed a highly effective and efficient global distribution network. Our international operations are headquartered in Barcelona, Spain with satellite locations in countries covering Europe, South America and Asia. With these locations, we are able to provide 24x7 international services to our Members worldwide, ensuring that they are conveniently helped by our physicians from whatever country where they are located. When medically necessary, our doctors can help Members navigate the local health systems to obtain the best healthcare for their situation. 
​
In our core, traditional markets we are targeting large employers and health plans while simultaneously committing incremental sales and marketing resources to the small to medium business (SMB) sales channel to increase our penetration within this market. Additionally, we intend to further penetrate the hospital and health systems market, building on our acquisition of InTouch Health, as we believe our Solo solution offers these markets an attractive platform from which to expand timely care access, improve provider efficiency, generate substantial income by acquiring new patients and better participate in emerging risk-sharing and value-based payment models, such as Accountable Care Organizations and Patient-Centered Medical Homes. 
​
We expanded our international presence through the acquisition of Advance Medical in 2018, building on our acquisition of Best Doctors in 2017. This international Client base, largely comprised of global financial services companies, provides fertile ground for expansion of our product portfolio through existing partners in attractive markets where our infrastructure is already in place. For instance, we see opportunity for service expansion in global markets through the localization and application of Livongo’s chronic condition programs for diabetes, hypertension, weight management, diabetes prevention, and mental health. We also see opportunity for marketing our Solo solution in international markets, supporting the needs of government health systems and hospitals, as well as private entities. 
​
Expand Through Focused Investments and Acquisitions
​
We plan to continue to support our overall strategy and market leadership with selective investments and acquisitions. To date, we have completed multiple acquisitions that have expanded our distribution capabilities, broadened our service offering, and created a broad global footprint. Our acquisition strategy is centered on acquiring products, capabilities, clinical specialties, technologies and distribution channels that are highly scalable and rapidly growing. We have also established a track record of integrating these acquisitions to deliver incremental value to our Clients and Members. For example, in July 2020 we acquired InTouch Health, the leading provider of enterprise solutions for hospitals and health systems and in October 2020 we acquired Livongo, the leading provider of solutions for the management of chronic conditions. The Livongo merger brought together two highly complementary companies to create a comprehensive platform for virtual care delivery that we believe will address customer demand for integrated solutions across the continuum of care, and that the combined company will deliver Whole Person care as a comprehensive partner with the patient and health system, driving better health and cost outcomes and fundamentally changing how patients access and experience healthcare. We further believe that the Livongo merger will position us as a leader in virtual health with differentiated scale and scope across primary, critical, chronic and complex care, on a global basis. 
​
Sales and Marketing
​
We sell our services principally through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise focused field sales professionals who are organized by geography and account size. Our field professionals are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data 

8



experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and hospital partners.
​
We generate Client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits and finance executives in addition to technology and health professionals, senior business leaders and healthcare channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include use of our website to provide information about our company and our solution, as well as learning opportunities for potential Members; demand generation; field marketing events; integrated marketing campaigns comprised of direct email and online advertising; and participation in industry events, trade shows and conferences.
 ​
Research and Development
​
Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new services, technologies, features and functionality. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in research and development and acquisitions to enhance our existing solution and introduce new high-quality applications and services. Our product development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. In addition, we utilize certain third party development services to perform application development and design services. We focus our efforts on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution.
​
Competition
​
We view as our competitors those companies that currently (or in the future will) (i) develop and market virtual care technology (devices, software, and systems) or (ii) provide virtual care services, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare and chronic condition management. Competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know-how and reputation. Competitors in the telehealth and expert medical services market include MDLive, Inc., Doctors on Demand, Inc., American Well Corporation and Grand Rounds, Inc., among other small industry participants. In the digital chronic condition management market, competitors include Omada, Virta, and other participants. In the market for technology solutions for hospitals and health systems, competitors include American Well Corporation and MDLive, Inc., as well as smaller technology providers.
​
Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A.
​
We contract for the services of our telehealth provider network through a services agreement with Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. formerly Teladoc Physicians, P.A. Under the services agreement, we have agreed to serve, on an exclusive basis, as manager and administrator of Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A.’s non-medical functions and services related to the provision of the telehealth services by providers employed by or under contract with Teladoc Health Medical Group, PA. The non-medical functions and services we provide under the services agreement primarily include Member management services, such as maintaining network operations centers for our Members to request a visit with Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A.’s providers, Member billing and collection administration, and maintenance and storage of Member medical records. Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. has agreed to provide our Members, through its providers, access to telehealth services and recommended treatment 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The services agreement also requires Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its providers. Under the services agreement, Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. currently pays us an access fee of $65,000 per month for network operations center and medical records maintenance, a fixed fee of approximately $1,815,000 and $1,151,000, respectively, per month for our provision of management and administrative services and marketing expense and a license fee of $10,000 per month for the non-exclusive use of the Teladoc Health trade name. The services agreement has a 20-year term and expires in February 2025 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds by the non-terminating party, a material breach of the services agreement by the non-terminating party or a governmental or judicial termination order related to the services agreement. The Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. is considered a variable interest entity and its financial results are included in Teladoc Health’s consolidated financial statements.

Regulatory Environment
​
Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In many jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. 
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities loosened or removed a number of regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period. We do not believe that our operations or results will be materially adversely affected by a return to the status quo from a regulatory perspective.
​
For additional discussion of our regulatory environment, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
​
The practice of medicine, including the provision of behavioral health services, is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care and cross coverage practice), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. Physicians and behavioral health professionals who provide professional medical or behavioral health services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine or to provide behavioral health treatment in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians and behavioral health professionals are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our Members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non-reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.
​
U.S. Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee Splitting
​
We contract with physicians or physician owned professional associations and professional corporations to deliver our U.S. telehealth services to their patients. We frequently enter into management services contracts with these physicians and physician owned professional associations and professional corporations pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third-party payors. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including those of New York, Texas and California, that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be

considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine.
​
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our Providers that interfere with our business and other materially adverse consequences.
​
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
​
Federal Stark Law
​
We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties of up to $25,820 for each violation and twice the dollar value of each such service and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $172,137 for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
​
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
​
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including civil monetary penalties of up to $104,330 and criminal fines of $100,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and imprisonment of up to ten years. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has published safe-harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a 

11



financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
​
False Claims Act
​
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action, even if the claim was originally submitted appropriately. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims provisions.
​
State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
​
Several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also adopted or may adopt similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
​
Other Healthcare Laws
​
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.
​
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback 

12



Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.
​
Foreign and U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
​
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, or PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A., our Providers and our health plan Clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the independent contractors, agents and other “business associates” of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI in connection with providing services to covered entities. We are a business associate of other covered entities when we are working on behalf of our affiliated medical groups.
​
Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. Our management responsibilities to Teladoc Health Medical Group, P.A. also include assisting it with its obligations under HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which has more than a low probability of compromising the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
​
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
​
HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically.
​
Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. The privacy and data protection laws in many states in which we operation are more restrictive than HIPAA and/or may apply more broadly than HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, protects the personal information of California consumers regardless of the location of the business holding the information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA or apply more broadly than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, 

13



but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. And numerous states are currently reviewing legislation that is similar to the CCPA. 
​
In addition to HIPAA and state information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal laws, including laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices which may include deceptive statements about privacy and security policies and practices. 
​
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. 
​
We are also subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time.
​
As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.
​
We are also subject to EU laws on data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EU to other jurisdictions. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. In addition, these rules are constantly under scrutiny. For example, following a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015, transferring personal data to U.S. companies that had certified as Members of the U.S. Safe Harbor Scheme was declared invalid. In July 2016, the European Commission adopted the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework which replaced the Safe Harbor Scheme. However, the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Framework was also declared invalid by the European Union Court of Justice in July 2020. The remaining legal mechanisms for transferring EU data outside the European Union are corporate binding rules and standard contractual clauses.
​
Some countries outside the European Union had adopted laws that are similar to the EU GDPR. For example, Brazil adopted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, referred to as LGPD, in 2018. The LGPD went into effect in August 2020 and will begin to be enforced starting in August 2021. The LGPD is closely aligned with the EU GDPR. 
​
International Regulation
​
We expect to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including 

14



the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which will apply across the EU effective May 2018), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act.
​
The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The U.K. Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. 
​
We also are subject to regulation by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.
​
Human Capital Management
​
At Teladoc Health, we live our values as a company through policies, governance and deliberate investment in operating responsibly and sustainably. We are committed to making a positive impact in society and, perhaps even more importantly, to encouraging others of like mind and spirit to join us in this critical work.
​
To fulfill our mission, we are focused on building a great company that becomes a global destination for amazing talent who want to build their careers, develop themselves, and grow both professional and personally. We design a range of programs and initiatives to nurture talent, encourage curiosity and innovation, make room for diverse voices and perspectives, increase engagement and connectiveness, and mentor leaders for the future roles. We build a range of total reward programs that support employees through competitive pay and benefits and invest in technology, tools, and resources to transform and increase the quality of work.
​
The Company employed approximately 4,400 people as of December 31, 2020. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 83% full time and 17% part time employees. Of the total population as of December 31, 2020, approximately 66% of our employees worked in the US and 34% worked in our international locations.
​
We continue to look for ways to expand a range of programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our workforce – including a focused engagement through Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion (DEI). We enhanced our efforts to include: 
​
Supporting Employees through Our Products and Services. We offer our portfolio of products to our employees, including full access to all of the Teladoc Health Virtual Care products such as free mental and behavioral health resources, digital health devices, and on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents.
​
Talent Development. We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers, through a multitude of training and development programs. These include online and self-paced courses, live in-

15



class education, professional speaker series, peer-to-peer learning, certification programs, and on-the-job training formats as well as executive talent and succession planning paired with an individualized development approach.
​
Expanding the Voice of the Employee. We strive to build a culture of soliciting employee feedback through our pulse engagement surveys and listening circles and seeking opportunities to advance employee feedback.
​
Diversity Council. We expanded the Teladoc Health diversity council, a group of senior leaders from throughout the organization that champions ongoing dialogue and engagement with our teams. This group has reported its work and findings annually to our board of directors since 2018.
​
Equal Pay Study. In 2020, we completed a global organization-wide pay equity study to help ensure that compensation reflects our prioritization of gender and racial equity and are committed to a recurring periodic review going forward.
​
Open Dialog to Encourage Diverse Thinking and Voices. In 2020, we launched the “Courageous Conversations Series” as an instrument for unearthing opportunities for discussion through effective dialogue across topics that intersect or singularly focus on impacting diversity, equity or inclusion.
​
Business Resource Groups (BRGs). We expanded our BRGs, which we believe are a foundational element of the DEI ecosystem. The BRGs include a focus on LGBTQ, women, multicultural and generational interests of employees who are engaged in four key pillars:
​

• | Building internal community/network
--+------------------------------------

​

• | Advancing external community
--+-----------------------------

​

• | Supporting business impact
--+---------------------------

​

• | Enhancing professional development
--+-----------------------------------

​
Focusing on diversity recruiting and talent acquisition. We established our diversity hiring manager training resources for performance-based interviewing, incorporated a screening tool to promote gender-neutral job descriptions and expanded our corporate partnerships to advance our pipeline of diverse talent.
​
Community Impact. We embrace the opportunity and the responsibility to have a meaningful impact in our global community, using our voice and our resources to help expand equitable access to care, and create a better future for families and our neighbors. As we move into 2021, we look forward to expanding our efforts working toward further mobilizing our workforce to give back to the communities where we live and work through new volunteer programs and corporate matching opportunities for giving. Our efforts in 2020 represented a strong start to the greater impact we are poised to have in our communities.

OTHER INFORMATION
​
Intellectual Property
​
We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and around the world. We also have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States and internationally. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. Other than the trademarks Teladoc Health (and design), Best Doctors (and design) and Advance Medical (and design), we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements in connection with their 

16



employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.
​
Seasonality
​
We typically experience the strongest increases in consecutive quarterly revenue during the fourth and first quarters of each year, which coincides with traditional annual benefit enrollment seasons. In particular, as a result of many Clients’ introduction of new services at the very end of the current year, or the start of each year, a concentration of our new Client contracts has an effective date of January 1. Therefore, while Membership increases, utilization is dampened until service delivery ramps up over the course of the year. 
​
As a result of national seasonal cold and flu trends, we typically experience our highest level of visit fees during the first and fourth quarters of each year. Conversely, the second quarter of the year has historically been the period of lowest utilization of our provider network services relative to the other quarters of the year. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we did not experience the typical seasonality associated with national cold and flu outbreaks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
