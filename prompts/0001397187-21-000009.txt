Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, nurturing entrepreneurial spirit, acting with honesty and courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun. These core values attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals, and share our purpose "to elevate the world by unleashing the full potential within every one of us."

(together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as "lululemon," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our." We refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 as "2020" and the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020 as "2019."

Our Products
Our healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel and accessories are marketed under the lululemon brand. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other sweaty pursuits. We

also offer a range of products designed for being On the Move and fitness-related accessories. We expect to continue to broaden our merchandise offerings through expansion across these product areas.
Our design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our customers, who we refer to as guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our design process. In this way, we believe we are better positioned to address the needs of our guests, helping us advance our product lines and differentiate us from the competition.
During the second quarter of 2020, we acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba MIRROR. MIRROR is an in-home fitness company with an interactive workout platform that features live and on-demand classes. The acquisition of MIRROR bolsters our digital sweatlife offerings and brings immersive and personalized in-home sweat and mindfulness content to new and existing lululemon guests.
Our Market
Our guests seek a combination of performance, style, and sensation in their athletic apparel, choosing products that allow them to feel great however they exercise. Since consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for functional products and a desire to live a particular lifestyle, we believe the credibility of our brand and the authentic community experiences we offer expand our potential market beyond just athletes to those who pursue an active, mindful, and balanced life.
Although our largest customer group is made up of guests who shop our women's range, representing 69% of our 2020 net revenue, we also design a comprehensive men's line and have a targeted strategy in place. Our business is growing as more guests discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our men's products, and are attracted by our distinctive brand.
North America is our largest market by geographical split, representing 86% of our 2020 net revenue. We are expanding internationally across Europe, the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), and the rest of Asia Pacific. We are expanding in these regions via a decentralized model, allowing for local community insight and consumer preference to inform our strategic expansion.
Our Segments
We primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer. 
We also conduct business through MIRROR, operate outlets and temporary locations, serve certain wholesale accounts, have license and supply arrangements, and hold warehouse sales from time to time. The financial results of these operations are disclosed in Other.

Company-Operated Stores
At the end of 2020, we operated 521 stores in 17 countries across the globe. In addition to being a venue to sell our products, our stores give us a direct connection to our guest, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product line. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls.

__________
(1)PRC included seven stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, two stores in Macao, Special Administration Region, and two stores in Taiwan, as of January 31, 2021. As of February 2, 2020, there were six stores in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, two stores in Macao, Special Administration Region, and one store in Taiwan.
We opened 30 net new company-operated stores in 2020, including 21 net new stores outside of North America.
We perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. During 2020, we closed 10 of our lululemon branded company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluations we may, in the future, close or relocate additional company-operated stores.
In fiscal 2021, our new store growth will come primarily from company-operated store openings in Asia and in the United States. Our real estate strategy over the next several years will not only consist of opening new company-operated stores, but also in overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations.
We believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. We typically use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores. As a significant number of our stores were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we do not believe sales per square foot is currently useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included this metric. 
Direct to Consumer
We believe that e-commerce is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to consumer channel also allows us to reach and serve guests in markets beyond where our physical retail locations are based. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets.
Table of Contents

We serve our guests via our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers or other retail locations.
We continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our guests, and to provide an enhanced omni-channel experience.
Other
Our other operations include:
•MIRROR - we offer in-home fitness through an interactive workout platform that allows our guests to subscribe for live and on-demand classes
•Outlets and warehouse sales - We utilize outlets as well as physical warehouse sales, which are held from time to time, to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons at discounted prices. As of January 31, 2020, we operated 38 outlets, with the majority in North America.
•Temporary locations - Our temporary locations, including seasonal stores, are typically opened for a short period of time. We believe these retail locations enable us to serve guests during peak shopping periods in markets where we do not ordinarily have a physical location, or enable us to better serve our guest in markets where we see high demand at our existing locations.
•Wholesale - Our wholesale accounts include premium yoga studios, health clubs, and fitness centers. We believe these premium wholesale locations offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, including outside of North America.
•License and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we believe that it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets.
We have license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Mexico. We retain the rights to sell lululemon products through our e-commerce websites in these countries. Under these arrangements we supply the partners with lululemon products, training and other support. An extension to the initial term of the agreement for the Middle East was signed in 2020 and it extends the arrangement to December 2024. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of January 31, 2021, there were four licensed retail locations in Mexico, three in the United Arab Emirates, and one in Qatar, which are not included in the above company-operated stores table.
Community-Based Marketing
We utilize a community-based approach to build brand awareness and guest loyalty. We pursue a multi-faceted strategy which leverages our local teams and ambassadors, digital marketing and social media, in-store community boards, and a variety of grassroots initiatives. We also plan to complement and amplify our community-based initiatives with global brand-building activity.
Product Design and Development
Our product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and technical superiority.
As we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we ultimately protect through agreements, trademarks, and trade-secrets.

Sourcing and Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.
We work with a group of approximately 40 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 59% of our products in 2020, with the largest manufacturer producing 17%. During 2020, 33% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 20% in Cambodia, 12% in Sri Lanka, and 9% in the PRC, including 2% in Taiwan.
We work with a group of approximately 65 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2020, 65% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, with the largest manufacturer producing 29%. During 2020, 45% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 18% from Mainland China, 16% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions. 
We also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.
We have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to our vendor code of ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams partner with leading inspection and verification firms to closely monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our vendor code of ethics.
Distribution Facilities
We operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in the United Sates, the PRC, and the Netherlands. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.
Competition
Competition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine function and fashion, and connect through in-store, online, and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guest.
The market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, Under Armour, Inc, and Columbia Sportswear Company. We also compete with retailers who have expanded to include women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand), Victoria's Secret with its sport and lounge offering, and Urban Outfitters, Inc.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 56% and 47% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to a significant number of our company-operated stores being temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020, we earned a higher proportion of our operating profit during the last two quarters of 2020 compared to prior years.

Human Capital 
Our Impact Agenda sets out our social and environmental commitments and strategy — across three interconnected pillars, Be Human, Be Well, and Be Planet. The Be Human pillar of our Impact Agenda sets out our focus areas with respect to our employees and broader community:
•advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (“IDEA”);
•supporting our employees through whole-person opportunities; and
•supporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain. 
In 2020, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented a range of measures to provide financial support to our employees and community and to ensure the safety for our people and guests. 
Advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action
We continually endeavor to create an environment that is equitable, inclusive, and fosters personal growth.
Diversity and inclusion are key components of our culture and are fundamental to achieving our strategic priorities and future vision. The diversity of our teams and working in an inclusive culture enables increased employee engagement, better decision making, greater adaptability, creativity, and a deeper understanding of the communities we serve. We are proud that as of January 31, 2021, approximately 55% of our board of directors, 65% of our senior executive leadership team, and 50% of all vice presidents and above are women, while approximately 75% of our overall workforce are women.(1)
We maintain 100% gender pay equity within our entire global employee population, meaning equal pay for equal work across genders. We have achieved pay equity across all areas of diversity in the United States and are seeking, to the extent permitted under local law and regulation, to collect the data necessary to confirm complete pay equity globally.
We are investing $5 million to fund to our global IDEA activities. These funds can further support the career progress of our diverse talent and increase access to internal opportunities and professional development. We offer all employees IDEA education, training, and guided conversations on a variety of topics, including anti-racism, anti-discrimination, and inclusive leadership behaviors. We aim to foster a culture of inclusion by making IDEA part of our everyday conversation, and frequently review our policies, programs, and practices to identify ways to be more inclusive and equitable. 
Supporting our employees through whole-person opportunities
We believe that each of our approximately 25,000 people are key to the success of our business. We strive to foster a distinctive culture rooted in our core values that attracts and retains passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals. We believe our people succeed because we create an environment that fosters growth and is diverse and equitable.
We assess our performance and identify opportunities for improvement through an annual employee engagement survey. In 2020, the participation rate was in excess of 90% and our employee engagement score was in the top 10% of retailers.(2) Our engagement score tells us whether our employees believe lululemon is a great place to work, whether they believe they are able to use their strengths at work, if they are motivated, and whether they would recommend lululemon as a great place to work. 
(1) While we track male and female genders, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.
(2) Based on an industry benchmark provided by the third party that administers this survey to our employees.

We understand that health and wealth programs need to offer choice at all stages of life. Our current offerings to support whole-person opportunities include, among other things: 
•Competitive compensation which rewards exceptional performance;
•A parenthood program which is a gender-neutral benefit that provides all eligible employees up to six months of paid leave; 
•An employee assistance program which provides free, confidential, support to all our employees and their families in a variety of areas from mental well-being to financial services to advice for new parents;
•Personal resilience tools to employees, ambassadors, and suppliers; 
•Reimbursement programs which reward physical activity; and
•A Fund your Future program for eligible employees which offers partial contribution matches to a pension plan and employee share purchase plan.
Supporting the wellbeing of the people who make our products in our supply chain 
We partner with our suppliers to work towards creating safe, healthy, and equitable environments that support the wellbeing of all the people who make our products. Our Vendor Code of Ethics is the foundation of our supplier partnerships. It adheres to international standards for working conditions, workers’ rights, and environmental protection, and its implementation focuses on prevention, monitoring, and improvement. Beyond labor compliance, we are committed to supporting worker wellbeing, building on years of partnerships with our suppliers around workplace practices and community support initiatives. 
We recently developed and implemented our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard, which outlines our expectations with respect to foreign migrant workers. This program, which has been successfully executed in Taiwan, has benefited approximately 2,700 migrant workers by virtually eliminating worker-paid fees. Based on lessons learned from this program, we are now expanding beyond Taiwan so that we can further support foreign migrant workers globally. 
Our COVID-19 response
We closely monitor the changing landscape of COVID-19 so that we can make appropriate decisions to support and keep our people safe. We acted swiftly during the year in response to the crisis by temporarily closing our stores, committing to pay protection for employees, launching our We Stand Together Fund, and launching our Ambassador Relief Fund. 
When our stores temporarily closed, we guaranteed pay to our North American employees through the entire closure period. As stores re-opened, we kept a pay guarantee in place, should a store need to close again for any reason, including if weather-related or related to civil unrest. We now have a minimum pay guarantee policy by role. 
We created a wide range of resiliency and connection sessions and tools to support our people during the pandemic and we made these resources available to our guests and the broader community.
Our We Stand Together Fund was established to support employees facing significant financial hardship with relief grants for basic and critical needs. To establish this fund, for three months the senior leadership team contributed 20% of their salary and our board of directors contributed 100% of their cash retainer, and employees donated as well. We plan to fund this program on an ongoing basis to aid affected employees. Separately, we contributed $4.5 million to our Ambassador Relief Fund to assist ambassador-run fitness studios with basic operating costs.
As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to prioritize the safety of our people and our guests. We are closely monitoring the situation in every market and community which we serve. We will temporarily close stores and restrict operations as necessary, based upon information from government and health officials.
Intellectual Property
We have trademark rights on many of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other trademarks for names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.
