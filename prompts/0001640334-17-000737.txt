Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization
 
Indoor Harvest Corp., or the "Company," is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office is located at 5300 East Freeway Suite A, Houston, Texas 77020.
Business
 
We are currently in the process of implementing a significant change in our business focus and structure. We are seeking to use the relationships and technology we have developed to become a registered producer and seller under the federal Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”) of pharmaceutical grade cannabis for research and targeted treatment of specific medical symptoms. We plan to discontinue our efforts to sell our current products and services related to vertical farming to include our branding, equipment and services. Instead, we will focus on licensing the use of our current branding, products and services exclusively for all cultivars except for cannabis to The Harvest Group, a new separate company with most of the same management as now, which will be spun off from our current business and in which we will retain a minority interest. 
Current Business and Operations
 
Indoor Harvest Corp, through its brand name Indoor Harvest®, is currently operating as a full service, state of the art design-build, engineering, procurement and construction firm for the indoor and vertical farming industry. The company provides production platforms, mechanical systems and complete custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture ("CEA") and Building Integrated Agriculture ("BIA"), tailored to the specific needs of virtually any cultivar.
 
CEA is the process of manipulating any agricultural technology to allow the farmer an ability to manipulate a crop's environment to desired conditions. Technologies include greenhouse production, hydroponics, aquaculture, aquaponics and aeroponics. Controlled variables may include temperature, lighting, humidity, pH and nutrient analysis.
 
BIA is the process of locating CEA methods on, or in, mixed use buildings to provide synergy with the buildings infrastructure and the agriculture process. Earliest examples of BIA include the use of hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics, where waste heat is captured through the building's existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning system as well as the combined use of solar, rainwater collection and evaporative systems. Current operating examples include such buildings as Eli Zabar's rooftop greenhouse, The Sun Works Center for Environmental Studies, Gotham Greens, Sky Vegetables, Top Sprouts, Cityscape Farms, Dongtan, Masdar City, AeroFarms, Solar 2, Lufa Farms, BrightFarms, FarmedHere, Green Sense Farms, Green Spirit Farms and Big Box Farms. The term building-integrated agriculture was coined by Dr. Ted Caplow in a paper delivered at the 2007 Passive and Low Energy Cooling Conference in Crete, Greece.
 
We currently offer a vertical farm racking system with integrated LED lighting. Our vertical farm racking system was designed to be used for both aeroponic and hydroponic layered crop production within a CEA or BIA operation. Our racking system will work with any standard 48" X 96" or 24" X 48" third party flood table or aeroponic system. We also offer patent pending aeroponic fixtures that are compatible with our vertical farm racking system. We offer our vertical farm racking system and aeroponic fixtures for use by both horticulture enthusiasts and commercial operators who seek to utilize vertical farming methods within a controlled indoor environment.
 
Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium (known as geoponics). Aeroponic culture differs from both conventional hydroponics and in-vitro (plant tissue culture) growing. Unlike hydroponics, which uses water as a growing medium and essential minerals to sustain plant growth, aeroponics is conducted without a growing medium. Because water is used in aeroponics to transmit nutrients, it is sometimes considered a type of hydroponics.
 
The Company generates revenue from vertical farm rack system sales, aeroponic fixture sales and design build construction management services. Our products are designed for the production of aeroponic and hydroponic leafy greens, micro-greens, fruiting plants and herbs. Our fixtures and systems can also be adapted for a variety of other uses such as horticulture research, medicinal plant production, pharmaceutical plant production, plant cloning and hardwood propagation.
 
In addition to these products, the Company also generates revenue from engineering, procurement and construction management services. Engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) is a common form of contracting arrangement for very large infrastructure and facility projects. Under an EPCM arrangement, the client engages the Company to coordinate all design, procurement and construction work to assure that the whole project is completed as required.

Active Potential Acquisition Plans and Status; Changes in Business Operations
 
On January 3, 2017, the Company signed a binding letter of intent with Alamo CBD, LLC (“Alamo CBD”) to enter discussions to combine and create a medical cannabinoids pharmaceutical group. Pursuant to the terms, the Company was required as a precondition to moving forward with the proposed transaction, to raise, as necessary, up to $1,000,000 in capital by February 15, 2017, to pay off all existing debt, including convertible notes, owed by the Company and to complete a spin-off of the Company’s produce related operations. On February 15, 2017 the Company and Alamo CBD extended the deadline until March 15, 2017. 
 
From February 22, 2017 through March 15, 2017, the Company sold, in reliance upon Regulation D Rule 506, a total of 2,060,000 shares of Common Stock to 17 U.S. accredited investors at $0.40 per share for cash totaling $824,000 and the Company and Alamo CBD agreed that sufficient capital had been raised to meet preconditions. The Company and Alamo CBD expect to execute a Definitive Agreement on April 21, 2017 which is summarized below. 
 
Summary of the proposed transaction
 
On March 16, 2017, the Company amended the original letter of intent with Alamo CBD and both parties have proposed the following general terms for the Definitive Agreement. 
 
  
· | Indoor Harvest Corp will acquire 100% of the membership interest of Alamo CBD, LLC, the result of which will be that Alamo will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Indoor Harvest. This would be a share to share exchange, under the original Alamo LOI provisions, in order to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. It is currently expected that the total number of shares to be issued to Alamo CBD, LLC will be 25,280,027 shares of common stock and that the total capital stock of Indoor Harvest Corp after Combination will be 41,953,378 shares of common stock.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A new Company, to be named “The Harvest Group”, will be formed by exiting Officers and Directors of Indoor Harvest Corp. 
· | Indoor Harvest will execute a license agreement with The Harvest Group to permit the exclusivity to the High Pressure Aeroponics technology portfolio created by Indoor Harvest for use in the Cannabis or its derivatives industry. The Harvest Group will maintain use of the technology and intellectual property of Indoor Harvest for industries not involving the Cannabis plant, which use shall be exclusive to Alamo CBD and Indoor Harvest. The THG License Agreement will include mutual exit options which will permit termination of the THG License Agreement. 
· | The Indoor Harvest Corp currently intends to hold a minority interest in The Harvest Group for a minimum period of one year and, subsequently, to distribute its shares of The Harvest Group to shareholders of Indoor Harvest Corp, as a dividend in a manner consistent with relevant SEC rules. 
· | The Harvest Group will operate independently of the Indoor Harvest Corp and Alamo CBD who will have no obligation for future funding beyond the amount of the initial investment, the amount of which is subject to agreement of the parties. 

 
Background of the proposed transaction
 
The purpose of the above-described proposed transaction is twofold, as follows:
 


· | It separates the Company’s cannabis and produce related operations, as we have indicated was a goal previously. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | It will put in place all elements necessary for the resulting Joint Venture, of which the resulting public reporting company will have a significant on-going interest, to become a registered producer under the federal Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”) to produce cannabis.

Until August 12, 2016, only one entity, the University of Mississippi could legally manufacture cannabis to supply researchers involved in the various studies about using cannabis to treat maladies such as PTSD or Epilepsy. On August 12, 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) issued a policy statement on cannabis issues, as follows:
 


· | It is well known that the DOJ and DEA have said that cannabis would continue to be classified as a Schedule 1 drug, like heroin. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | It is not so well known that the DOJ and DEA also reset the policy regarding entities that could legally manufacture cannabis to supply researchers involved in various clinical studies using cannabis to treat maladies such as PTSD or Epilepsy.

 
According to the policy statement, the purpose of this policy reset is to increase the number of U. S. entities registered under the CSA to grow (manufacture) cannabis to supply researchers on the effectiveness of medical grade cannabis in treating these and other maladies.
 
The CSA under subsection 823(a)(1) provides, DEA is obligated to register only the number of bulk manufacturers of a given schedule I or II controlled substance that is necessary to "produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes.”
 
The policy statement (Federal Register Vol. 81) provided additional explanation on how the DEA will evaluate applications for such registration consistent with the CSA and the obligations of the United States under the applicable international drug control treaty. The Company has reviewed these guidelines and believes all applicable requirements which cannot be met by the Company alone will be met by the following:
 


· | Our current Cannabis Pilot Agreement and completed technology trials with Canopy Growth Corporation, a Canadian licensed producer under the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, has demonstrated that our aeroponic biomanufacturing technology can augment and improve the quality and production of cannabis for use in cannabis research. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We believe that the proposed combination with Alamo and the joint venture with Vyripharm Enterprises, LLC, in which the Company will have an equity interest due to its combination with Alamo, as described below, will meet all the additional guidelines and conditions set forth regarding the expected required experience in handling of a controlled substance and its related research with cannabis for pharmaceutical use that is one of the conditions of the policy statement.

 
Contractual Joint Venture with Alamo CBD, LLC and Vyripharm Enterprises, LLC
 
On March 23, 2017, the Company entered into a Contractual Joint Venture Agreement by and between Indoor Harvest Corp, Vyripharm Enterprises, LLC (“Vyripharm”) and Alamo CBD, collectively the Parties, pursuant to which the parties agreed to participate in an unincorporated joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) for the following business purposes:
 
 
· | The parties will work together to enhance the ability of Alamo CBD to apply for and obtain licensure, or a permit, to grow and/or dispense marijuana products for medical and/or consumer use, as the case may be: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | · | In Texas, pursuant to the Texas Compassionate Use Act, as may be amended; 
 | · | In Colorado, pursuant to recent Colorado legislation permitting foreign ownership of entities that grow and/or dispense marijuana products for medical and/or consumer use; and 
 | · | Pursuant to recent United States Drug Enforcement Administration regulations which expand the opportunities for entities providing research involving marijuana and its chemical constituents, as referenced in 21 U.S.C. 822(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. 823(a), et. seq.
· | To establish Alamo CBD as a supplier of a variety of medical use cannabis oil to Vyripharm for Vyripharm’s use in conducting research and development to create novel pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceutical compounds designed to image and treat certain debilitating diseases including, but not limited to epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s, ALS, and other neurodegenerative diseases; and to establish Indoor Harvest as the project developer and engineering, procurement and construction group, in which Indoor Harvest is responsible for costs and efforts related to Alamo CBD's efforts to become licensed under the Texas Compassionate Use Act and to meet its obligations under this Joint Venture agreement.

Exclusivity
 
During the term of the Joint Venture, the Parties have agreed to work exclusively with one another with respect to any purpose related, directly or indirectly, to the purpose of the Joint Venture.
Our Current Products
 
There are currently several different growing technologies being deployed in vertical indoor farming operations. The most common of these technologies include the following: nutrient film technology, ebb and flow systems (flood and drain), drip irrigation, water culture systems, raft systems and aeroponic systems. Aeroponics is a method of growing plants in a sealed environment by suspending plant roots in an automated atomized liquid nutrient environment. Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil.
 
As part of our proposed spin-off described above, the Company would license the use of the Company’s branding, products and services to The Harvest Group exclusively for all cultivars except for cannabis.

Design-Build, Engineering, Procurement and Construction Services
 
In addition to the products above, the Company also offers both design build and engineering, procurement and construction management services. Design-Build ("DB"), or Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management ("EPCM") are both common forms of contracting arrangement to design, construct and deliver large infrastructure and facility projects. Under a DB/EPCM arrangement, the client would engage the Company to coordinate all design, procurement and construction work to ensure that the whole project is completed as required.
 
As part of our proposed spin-off and combination with Alamo CBD described above, the Company would cease all DB/EPCM operations. The proposed spin-off Company, the Harvest Group, would be provided exclusive license for the use of the Company’s branding, products and services for use in DB/EPCM projects. 
 
DB/EPCM agreements offer the following benefits:
 


· | Custom design and engineering 
--+------------------------------------------------
· | Clear and concise project cost estimates 
· | Risk assessment 
· | Pre-construction planning and drawings 
· | Management of manufacturing and sub-contracting
· | General construction management 
· | Turnkey operations 

 
Our two-phase DB/EPCM process offers complete design, engineering, procurement and construction services. We discuss with clients their space and crop selections before we offer guidance on production platforms. Our DB/EPCM agreements are designed to begin a risk assessment, production design, including space design if no client side architect is involved. The first phase of a project, also known as the execution phase, which normally follows what is known as a FEED, or Front End Engineering Design phase. The FEED is a basic engineering design used as the basis for the second phase and is required to produce price estimates or a purchase order. The FEED can be divided into separate packages covering different portions of a project and generally requires an upfront deposit to begin. In some cases, the DB/EPCM contract requires us to execute and deliver the project within an agreed time and budget, commonly known as a Lump Sum Turn Key ("LSTK") Contract. In other cases where projects may have many unknown risks, are research and development heavy, or where first-of-its kind equipment is being specified. In these cases, Cost Plus (CP) agreements, which require reimbursement of expenses plus a percent for profit, may be used to spread risk to the client.
 
Once Phase One design work is complete, we deliver the client a manufacturing and construction estimate and plans. Phase Two includes construction and construction management services. Under a phase two DB/EPCM agreement, our engineers provide detailed engineering design of the project, procure all the equipment and materials necessary, and then construct to deliver a functioning facility or asset to the client. Our platform architects, engineers and project managers examine every aspect of a potential build-out (or upgrade from a legacy platform). We design for a client’s crop selection using various hydroponic production methods with a specialty in High Pressure Aeroponic systems. We rigorously test every individual system component (whether designed by us or by one of our technology partners) in our Texas-based R&D facility.

Although focused on equipment finance and working capital, OneWorld also works with service companies, manufacturers, healthcare providers and municipalities to help its customers plan for and acquire funding for capital acquisitions, refinancing and operational expansion.
 
Current Operational Activities
 
The Company has several pending and active projects. As part of the proposed combination with Alamo CBD and the separation of the Company’s cannabis and produce related operations, it is currently expected that the spin-off group, The Harvest Group, will assume responsibility of the Pasadena Texas CLARA Project, Design Partnership with Freight Farms and the MOA with IGES Canada Ltd. and its associated projects. The Company would continue to be responsible for the Tweed Cannabis Pilot. 
Pasadena Texas CLARA Project
 
On March 31, 2015, the Company signed a LOI with the City of Pasadena, Texas to fund the establishment and provisioning of an indoor agricultural facility (vertical farm) to be in Pasadena Texas. Under the LOI, the City was to provide Indoor Harvest, or a partner of their designation with City approval, with two facilities owned by the City for the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) per annum for a period not to exceed twenty (20) years as well as provide tax abatements on these properties for use in the construction of a Community Located Agricultural Research Area ("CLARA") project. On December 1, 2015, the City of Pasadena, Texas, unanimously voted in favor of a Chapter 380 Economic Development Agreement with Indoor Harvest for establishing CLARA, an open source, vertical farm and education campus on the City’s north side.
 
The agreement supporting the construction of an indoor vertical farming facility to be utilized in research, testing and prototyping of hydroponic and aeroponic plant nutrient growing systems, and as a showroom of the various equipment/technology used in these environments. Plans called for such growing areas as deemed appropriate to provide proof-of-concept for Indoor Harvest design and engineering, and education facilities, classrooms or other areas where training in vertical farm management could be accomplished. In collaboration with the Houston Food Bank, Harris County Public Health, PeopleFund, the Pasadena Health Center (FQHC) and others, the CLARA project strives to produce and distribute local sources of produce in the north Pasadena community in Harris County. Additionally, the CLARA project is intended to increase consumption of these healthy foods by implementing "food prescriptions" to people in need and develop a need-based Food Scholarship Program which will provide free food at a Houston Food Bank partner agency, called a “Scholarship Pantry.”
 
In the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed environmental testing of the properties to be provided by the City of Pasadena and the presence of high levels of both asbestos and lead contamination was detected. The cost of abatement and remediation required to bring the properties up to safe conditions was determined to be cost prohibitive. In the first quarter of 2017, a new 1.9 acre, open land site was provided by the City of Pasadena which passed environmental inspections in March 2017. With these new developments, the company is currently negotiating with commercial partners and lenders to deploy the project as originally agreed.
 
On October 11, 2016, the CLARA project was announced as a winner of General Electric’s (“GE”) HealthyCities Leadership Academy, a part of GE’s healthymagination commitment to mentor and support leaders in their communities as they develop and support new strategies to tackle population health challenges. The goal of the initiative is for community and business leaders to work together to help the cities, towns and communities where they live and work to address significant health challenges. The CLARA project was one of nine projects chosen after a thorough evaluation of all eligible entries based on their ability to demonstrate a clear potential to improve the health of all socioeconomic strata of the targeted community. Selections were determined by a panel of distinguished judges who have expertise in the fields of population health, public health, and healthcare. The CLARA project will receive an initial award of $25,000 in prize money to help develop population health improvements through partnerships with public and private entities, and will be eligible for a final prize award of $250,000 after a year of collaborative learning and support.

Design Partnership with Freight Farms
 
On December 17, 2015, we entered a design partnership with Freight Farms to jointly explore new cultivar platforms. Freight Farms, makers of the Leafy Green Machine shipping container farms, will leverage Indoor Harvest’s unique expertise as the leading design-build firm of indoor farms to explore innovative new applications for its Leafy Green Machine. The companies intended to work together to explore how Freight Farms’ containerized approach to indoor farming could be deployed in new ways to reach into untapped markets, including those internationally, as well as applications for non-profits and pharmaceutical research. As of December 31, 2016, no projects were developed under the agreement and it is not currently expected that either party will perform projects under this agreement due to changes in both parties’ business plans. 
 
MOA with IGES Canada Ltd.
 
On January 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement ("MOA") with IGES Canada Ltd. ("IGESCA"), a Canadian company that is a technology solution integrator in the vertical farming market. The MOA sets forth terms for a relationship between the Company and IGESCA to grow, market and sell vertical farming solutions globally.
 
Subject to the terms of the MOU, IGESCA and Indoor Harvest agree to partner to market and sell Indoor Harvest's solutions in conjunction with the IGESCA business platform to clients globally. Our responsibilities include Delivering Turnkey Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) solutions for CEA facilities, ongoing support and access to financing options through Noesis for designated projects. The responsibilities of IGESCA include identifying new and concluding project engagements from the current potential portfolio of 15 facilities, ongoing operations and regulatory navigation.
 
Both Indoor Harvest and IGESCA agree that any intellectual property, which is jointly developed and filed through activities covered under this MOA, can be used by either party for sales/marketing purposes with the consent of the other party which can be set forth in initial guidance. All other intellectual property used in the implementation of the MOA will remain the property of the party that provided it. This property can be used by either party for purposes covered by the MOA but consent will be obtained from the owner of the property before using it for purposes not covered by the MOA. The MOA shall remain in effect for a period of three (3) years from that date signing unless earlier terminated. The project is currently active and one project in Johnstown Ontario has been signed and there currently are five additional projects pending. 
 
Vertical Farm Project in Johnstown Ontario Canada
 
On July 13, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM, maximum guaranteed price agreement, for a 40,000-sq. ft. vertical farm project in Johnstown Ontario Canada with IGES Canada ltd., the project included 676 Low Tide VFRack platforms, integrated LED lighting, facilities mechanical, electrical and plumbing, construction management and equipment start-up and commissioning. Total contract maximum guaranteed price is $11,374,500 with 5% of the total, $568,725 due upon the start of design work. Originally contracted to begin on September 23, 2016, the project start date has been delayed by the client for administrative reasons as they close additional funding to expand their farm deployment plans for 2017.
Tweed Cannabis Pilot
 
On September 28, 2015, the Company and Tweed (through its parent company, Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy Growth”), formerly Tweed Marijuana Inc.) extended its existing Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement (“Cannabis Pilot”) signed on December 18, 2014 for an additional two years. From February 19 through March 7, 2015, the Company completed installation of three mobile research labs at Canopy Growth's, subsidiary Tweed located in Smith Falls Canada as part of the Cannabis Pilot between the two Companies.
 
The Cannabis Pilot will test the production of Cannabis using an aeroponics system designed by Indoor Harvest. The Cannabis Pilot will make a record of the growth rate, phytocannabinoid production, water usage, fertilizer usage and labor using the aeroponics system(s) provided by Indoor Harvest. The recorded data from the Cannabis Pilot will be compared to Tweed's existing production methods. At the conclusion of the Cannabis Pilot, upon review of the data, Canopy Growth and Indoor Harvest shall jointly secure intellectual property rights for the resulting aeroponics system(s) (at each Party's discretion as to whether they wish to participate in intellectual property filings) and Indoor Harvest will be provided manufacturing rights.

The Cannabis Pilot is broken into two separate phases, as follows:
 
 
· | During Phase One, tests will be conducted using equipment initially provided by Indoor Harvest. The purpose of Phase One is to test the initial design and evaluate the root mass development of various strains of Cannabis chosen by Canopy Growth. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Upon completion of Phase One, Canopy Growth, based on the results of Phase One, will have the option to request Design Build services to be provided by Indoor Harvest. Indoor Harvest will provide these services free of charge. Indoor Harvest will provide projected costs associated with the manufacture and installation of the new aeroponics designs. Canopy Growth will then have the option to purchase equipment from Indoor Harvest based on these projected costs. There is no obligation to purchase equipment under the Agreement.

  
Indoor Harvest will be responsible for providing all the equipment related to the aeroponics system being tested, to include a temporary partitioned testing lab structure to be used within Canopy Growth's existing facilities and the cost associated with delivery and installation of the aeroponics system and testing lab, including design changes and subsequent changes based on feedback from Phase One testing.
 
Canopy Growth will be responsible for providing adequate space in a Controlled Environment for testing purposes to include water service, local area drain and electrical service. Canopy Growth will also provide the personnel and labor to operate and maintain the equipment provided by Indoor Harvest. Canopy Growth will make a reasonable effort to provide Indoor Harvest with weekly updates to include photographs of the plants being grown and their root development as well as all associated data required under the Agreement.
 
Upon completion of the Cannabis Pilot, Indoor Harvest and Canopy Growth will jointly apply for patents ("New IP") on the technology developed under the Cannabis Pilot. Canopy Growth will be provided exclusive rights to cultivate cannabis using the New IP in Canada and other jurisdictions outside the United States, at a royalty-free rate for the duration of the patent (including any extension of the patent). Indoor Harvest will have exclusive royalty-free rights to cultivate cannabis using the New IP in the United States for the duration of the patent (including any extension of the patent) and will be provided rights to use the New IP in all jurisdictions, royalty-free, for the cultivation of all other species of cultivars, to specifically exclude cultivation of cannabis using the New IP. Indoor Harvest will only have rights to cultivate cannabis in the United States using the New IP. All of these rights are intended to be for commercial production of cultivars.
 
Indoor Harvest will be provided exclusive manufacturing rights for a period of 10 years on the New IP developed under the agreement. All equipment manufactured by Indoor Harvest will be provided to Canopy Growth by way of a "cost plus agreement" not to exceed 15% allowable for profit.
 
Both parties are responsible for the costs associated with meeting their obligations outlined in this Agreement. Under no circumstance, do Canopy Growth's costs exceed those associated with the cost of plants, labor and general costs of production including water and electricity. However, any costs related to third party laboratory analysis and testing of phytocannabinoids will be shared equally by both parties.
 
On July 6, 2016, we entered into Phase Two of our Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth Corporation and signed a design-build, EPCM, cost plus contract with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth, to construct a High Pressure Aeroponic (“HPA”) production system to include facility integration and controls for the purpose of an economic pilot. The production system will include 13 HPA units and a Nutrient Dispensing System (pump skid). Additional costs for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls will be invoiced prior to hardware shipment and onsite installation under a cost-plus agreement. As of March 31, 2017, installation of the 13 HPA units had begun at Tweed’s facility with an expected completion in late April 2017. Once complete, Tweed will complete a series of final economic pilots under the terms of the Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement.

Research and Development
 
In January 2015, we began construction of a controlled environment testing facility. The facility will be used to test production yields for a variety of cultivars using both our aeroponic and vertical farm framing designs. This data will then be used to develop business plans and marketing materials for our product and services. As of the date of this report, we had completed the walls and partitions, area drainage and flooring. No additional work has been completed as of December 31, 2016. It is currently expected that no further work will be completed or approved until the combination with Alamo CBD is consummated. 
 
Under our Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth, we conducted an initial test between March and August 2015. A sativa dominant strain, Ghost Train Haze, was selected and 8 plants were grown in a 4' X 8' X 2' system using a "Screen of Green" cultivation method, in which plants are cropped and trained to produce a higher yield from a single plant. The Company's patent pending aeroponic system showed a significant increase in growth rate during the vegetative stage, as compared to more traditional production methods such as drip irrigation using coco.
 
Fertilizer usage was reduced by as much as 68% over Canopy Growth's existing production with the aeroponic system averaging 8 gallons a day under high pressure sodium and 9 gallons a day under LED, operating drain to waste. As tuning of the system progressed, average water use was reduced to approximately 5 gallons per day drain to waste. The Company believes that through additional tuning, more water savings for drain to waste and under recirculated operation can be achieved, and water use could be reduced by as much as 98% overall. Under 2,000 watts of high-pressure sodium lighting, the aeroponic system produced 3.1 pounds of dried flowers and under 1,040 watts of LED lighting produced 2.8 pounds of dried flowers in its initial test. The Company believes that with additional tuning, yield can be increased. On December 10, 2015, we began a second pilot under our Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth and similar results were achieved.
 
On July 6, 2016, we entered into Phase Two of our Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth Corporation and signed a design-build, EPCM, cost plus contract with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth, to construct a High Pressure Aeroponic (“HPA”) production system to include facility integration and controls for the purpose of an economic pilot. The production system will include 13 HPA units and a Nutrient Dispensing System (pump skid). Additional costs for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls will be invoiced prior to hardware shipment and onsite installation under a cost-plus agreement. As of March 31, 2017, installation of the 13 HPA units had begun at Tweed’s facility with an expected completion in late April 2017. Once complete, Tweed will complete a series of final economic pilots under the terms of the Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement. 
 
Potential Customers
 
We believe, based on our own formal and informal research that our current products and services appeal to three distinct markets. Those markets include business-to-business clients, commercial growers and horticulture researchers who are currently using aeroponics or other indoor growing technologies. We intend to market our products to these markets simultaneously. Pending the consummation of the proposed combination with Alamo CBD, the Company would maintain exclusive right to market and sell all products and services related to cannabis and the spin-off group, The Harvest Group, would maintain exclusive right to market and sell all products and services related to all cultivars except cannabis. The following is a description of these markets. 
 
Business-to-Business Clients - We currently have business-to-business ("B2B") relationships with Illumitex, Inc., Freight Farms, Inc. and IGES Canada Ltd. B2B is a type of commerce transaction that exists between businesses, such as those involving a manufacturer and wholesaler, or a wholesaler and a retailer. B2B refers to business that is conducted between companies, rather than between a company and individual consumers. The Company expects to add additional B2B clients as well as expand its reseller and authorized dealer programs.
 
Commercial Growers - Commercial agriculture is beginning to migrate to CEA and BIA. We believe that our products and services provide an affordable vertical farming and turn-key facility solutions for urban commercial growers who produce for local restaurants, hotels, wholesale and retail markets. Our systems can also be used in re-forestation projects or other revitalization projects through the system's ability to clone and propagate a variety of plant cuttings and hardwood cuttings.
Horticulture Researchers - The modular nature of our system design and custom fabrication abilities allow for numerous configurations from the same system. Our platform provides a variety of aeroponic delivery methods and plant support structures from the same system. This provides maximum flexibility to researchers who are experimenting with different plant species and are attempting to keep costs down.

We believe that cannabis has the potential to be a large market for our equipment. Our proposed combination with Alamo CBD would cause us to become a producer of cannabis. Alamo CBD, which would become a wholly owned subsidiary, is seeking to produce cannabis under the Texas Compassionate Use Program and to apply with the Drug Enforcement Agency, to become a registered producer of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act. We are currently developing and offering products which could be specifically used in the production of cannabis under our agreement with Canopy Growth in Canada, where medical cannabis is legal throughout the country. We will only directly enter markets where cannabis is legal and only then if we do not believe there is any material likelihood that we could be found in violation of federal law in the U. S. through the sale of our products. See "Government Regulation and Certification," below.
 
Marketing
 
The Company currently offers its products to B2B clients, through authorized dealer groups and resellers, as well as offering direct commercial sales and design-build, engineering, procurement and construction services from our website. Pending the consummation of the proposed combination with Alamo CBD, the Company would maintain exclusive right to market and sell all products and services related to cannabis and the spin-off group, The Harvest Group, would maintain exclusive right to market and sell all products and services related to all other cultivars except cannabis. As of the date of this filing, we have one oral agreement with a distributor and four written agreements with B2B clients. We are currently developing our marketing plan, which may include some or all of the following marketing methods:
Direct Mail - The use of direct mail allows us to reach a wide audience within a targeted market. A direct mail campaign may consist of a letter of introduction and a brochure featuring the products and services provided by the Company.
Internet Marketing - The Company intends to utilize social networks such as YouTube and Facebook as well as reaching out to industry bloggers and news sites in order to reach potential customers. The company can also sponsor, or advertise with hydroponic and other related horticulture online forums, social networks and online magazines. The Company, in the future, plans to offer its products for sale via the internet.
 
The Company intends to launch a social media network under the domain name aerofarmer.com. The company intends to host forums, articles and blogs related specifically to aeroponic indoor farming while also offering a retail sales point for its products and services.
 
Trade Shows and Special Events - The Company intends to participate in industry trade shows and events to create market awareness for its products and services.
 
We market our products to customers desiring to grow all varieties of agricultural products. We do not intend to exclude the growers of any agricultural products, including cannabis, from our marketing efforts. As of the date of this report, we are developing and offering fixtures specifically for cannabis production in Canada under our agreement with Canopy Growth. All our current fixtures can be adapted for use by cannabis growers. In the future, we may develop additional fixtures, or be contracted to design additional systems, specifically for cannabis production. Marketing our products in the U.S. in state and local jurisdictions where marijuana is legal is still uncertain due to the uncertain legal status of the growth, sale and use of cannabis due to conflicting laws under which what is illegal federally is to varying extents legal under certain state laws to the contrary [and even greater uncertainty as to what would constitute ancillary illegal activities such as aiding or abetting if any such direct actions are deemed illegal; and even if direct illegality laws were enforced, whether any ancillary related laws such as aiding and abetting would, if ever, be enforced]. We believe that if the cannabis industry were to become fully legal under both U.S. federal and state law, then this industry may well be where the most advances in technology related to our products could come from. We are also working on developing cannabis-specific products in Canada under our agreement with Canopy Growth. Thus, it is not unreasonable, but is not certain, to assume that the cannabis industry will become the biggest market for the type of equipment that we manufacture.

Our Competition and Our Market Position
 
The vertical farming industry is estimated to reach $3.88 Billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 30.7% between 2015 and 2020 based on a report by MarketsandMarkets, the world's No. 2 firm in terms of annually published premium market research reports. There are several Companies operating vertical farms that are offering licensing and franchises based on proprietary systems and production methods. These Companies include Aerofarms, Truleaf, FarmedHere, UrbanBarns, Green Sense Farms and Green Spirit Farms. These Companies offer a turn-key platform and operation. We believe that this approach limits a client’s options and burdens them with licensing and branding restrictions. We approach every client as an individual project and can offer a wide range of technologies and production methods. It is imperative that these competitors maintain control over production data to justify licensing. We believe the industry is moving towards open data and open source technologies that will reduce the advantage of individual licensing of production methods and platforms. We believe our design-build approach and utilization of open data of production and flexibility in system design provides us a competitive advantage.
 
There are two main manufacturers that currently manufacture high pressure aeroponic systems. They are Agrihouse™ and Aerofarms™. These companies are currently engaged in the manufacture and sales of commercial aeroponic vertical farming systems. These systems can only be used in a single mode with high pressure aeroponics and offer limited sizing options. Our system can operate in dual modes, both LPA and HPA, and our AGT fixture is available in optional sizes that our competitors currently do not offer. There are also companies such as general Hydroponics® and Botanicare® that manufacture aeroponic and hydroponic growing systems for the hobbyist. These systems are only available in low pressure aeroponics and require individual reservoirs. They also are offered in limited sizes and are not designed for vertical operation. These systems only provide a single mode of operation.
 
We will be a small competitor in the industry. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do.
 
We believe based upon management's knowledge of the industry that we are the first company to develop and offer a fixture based vertical farming platform. Instead of relying on a complete engineered system, we have developed individual fixtures that can be used in whole, or in part, to create a variety of modular vertical farming systems of any scale, or size. By breaking our platform down into individual, independent fixtures, we offer a level of custom ability that currently is not offered by our competitors.
 
Our fixtures can be used individually, or incorporated into do-it-yourself designed systems that many smaller commercial operators chose to build. This allows us to not only compete for sales to commercial growers who are developing their own systems, but also with growers who are looking for a complete system. We believe this will allow us to increase our market share and allows us to benefit from both commercial and retail sales. When combined with our engineering, procurement and construction management services, we can offer custom, turn-key facilities.

Design-Build, EPCM Agreements
 
On March 8, 2016, we entered a design-build, EPCM contract with OD Farms for a 7,000 sq. ft. cannabis production facility in Alaska. The contract includes an EPCM agreement for HVAC, LED lighting and facility controls. On April 21, 2016, we completed initial design work and provided the client with a ROM estimate of $2,009,308 for HVAC, LED lighting, facility controls and equipment schedule. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had closed this project and recorded $35,000 in other revenue for design services and removed the project from current projects pending further instructions from the client.
 
On July 6, 2016, we entered into Phase Two of our Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation and signed a design-build, EPCM, cost plus contract with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth, to construct a High Pressure Aeroponic (“HPA”) production system to include facility integration and controls for the purpose of an economic pilot. The production system will include 13 HPA units and a Nutrient Dispensing System (pump skid). Additional costs for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls will be invoiced prior to hardware shipment and onsite installation under a cost-plus agreement. The Company has received $100,796 in purchase orders as of March 31, 2017. This project is expected to be completed in late April 2017. 
 
On July 13, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM, maximum guaranteed price agreement, for a 40,000 sq. ft. vertical farm project in Johnstown Ontario with IGES Canada ltd., the project includes 676 Low Tide VFRack platforms, integrated LED lighting, facilities mechanical, electrical and plumbing, construction management and equipment start-up and commissioning. Total contract maximum guaranteed price is $11,374,500 with 5% of the total, $568,725 due upon the start of design work. Originally contracted to begin on September 23, 2016, the project start date has been delayed by the client for administrative reasons as they close additional funding to expand their farm deployment plans for 2017.
 
On July 27, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM, cost plus agreement, with TexAg Ventures, LLC, to provide full design and engineering, system prototyping and system testing of a custom vertical farming platform. An initial deposit of $35,000 is required to begin prototyping. Design and engineering services were to be provided free and remaining project costs will be deemed construction coordination services and billed at cost plus. As of September 30, 2016, 100% of the design work had been completed and we are awaiting further instructions from the client to begin prototyping. There is no assurance that we will begin prototyping or that the Company will receive revenue from this project. 
 
Manufacturing
 
We will source our products and accessories from third party manufacturing companies that manufacture products in part using tooling we own, in accordance with our specifications, and subject to our patent pending intellectual property rights.
 
We currently own tooling to produce HDPE aeroponic trays in 48"X96"X12" and 48"X96"X24" sizes through a process known as rotational molding and thermoforming. We also own tooling to produce thermoformed molds in 24"X48" for ABS plastic. We currently outsource our rotational molding to Freeman Engineered Products and thermoforming to Robinson Industries. We are currently capable of manufacturing our VFRack framing systems in-house, though we may choose to sub contract to third parties depending on project location and number of fixtures purchased. We currently have no agreements with third parties to manufacture our products. We can produce up to 800 frames per month currently in -house.
 

17

 
All our products and fixtures are made using very common fabrication and manufacturing methods. We have access to numerous companies around the world that offer metal fabrication, powder coating and plastic thermoforming and rotational molding. We contract and source from companies based on geographic location and volume ability. We can transport our tooling from one manufacturer to another and in some cases, we contract to have new tooling built depending on the volume of a client's order. Because we use common manufacturing methods and because our products are designed with these common manufacturing methods in mind, we can meet any scale or project size. Any volume limits or lead times based on available manufacturing is discussed with the client during the design phase and pricing phase. The capacity limits are those of our suppliers and manufacturers, not of ours. So, if we have more orders than these suppliers and manufacturers can supply parts and/or complete third party manufacturing in any month, we will advise our client of a delay in the delivery time. 
 
Pending the consummation of the proposed combination with Alamo CBD, the Company would maintain exclusive right to manufacture and sell all products and services related to cannabis and the spin-off group, The Harvest Group, would maintain exclusive right to manufacture and sell all products and services related to produce and all cultivars except cannabis. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent law, trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks.
 
On December 6, 2011, a U.S. federal trademark registration was filed for Indoor Harvest (Serial Number 85488194) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") granted a first 6-month extension for use on January 5, 2013 and were granted a fifth extension for use on January 8, 2015. On August 18, 2015, we registered Indoor Harvest as a trademark for use.
 
On May 15, 2013, the Company filed a provisional application for patent on a "modular aeroponic system and related methods" (Serial Number 61/823,330) with the USPTO. The inventor was recorded as Chad Sykes, our CEO and sole Founder and Indoor Harvest Corp was named as the assignee. To obtain our patent, the Company will need to convert its provisional application for patent, into a non-provisional application for patent. On May 15, 2014, the Company converted its provisional patent into a non-provisional patent and recorded an expense of $1,730.
 
On September 22, 2015, we received our first office action from the USPTO. We responded to comments on our patent application and received a second office action on February 1, 2017 and are preparing our response. We do not currently have a patent, the USPTO will conduct a further review of our patent application and provide us with comments. We must satisfy all comments before the USPTO will grant us a patent. There is no guarantee that a patent will be granted. While our patent application is under review, we may use the term "patent pending" on all published materials regarding our process applied for patent.
 
It is anticipated that we will retain all rights to this IP but it will be licensed to The Harvest Group as part of the spin-off transaction.
 
Governmental Regulation and Certification
 
We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals for any of our products or services. 
 
As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. if such equipment is used by customers who intend to purchase and use our aeroponic and vertical farm framing systems to grow cannabis. Under Federal law, and more specifically the Federal Controlled Substances Act, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting another's criminal activities. The Federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who "commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal." 18 U.S.C. §2(a). However, we do not believe that the Company's current and intended business as described in this report violates federal law and believe we would prevail if any such action were brought against us.
