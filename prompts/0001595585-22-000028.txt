ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our goal is to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, through the treatment of metabolic acidosis. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of our investigational drug candidate, veverimer (also known as TRC101), a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding and removing acid from the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. 
Diabetes and hypertension have long been recognized as modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD. More recently, metabolic acidosis, a serious condition in which the body has retained too much acid, has also been identified as a key modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for slowing CKD progression through the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis. We estimate that metabolic acidosis affects approximately 4.3 million patients with CKD in the United States, and we believe that slowing CKD progression through the treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD represents a significant unmet medical need and market opportunity. 
We are currently conducting a renal outcomes clinical trial, VALOR-CKD (also known as TRCA-303), to determine if veverimer slows CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. Our VALOR-CKD trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, time-to-event trial. The primary endpoint in the VALOR-CKD trial is defined as time to first occurrence of any event in the composite of renal death, end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, or a confirmed ≥ 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, which is also known as DD40. Enrollment of patients in the VALOR-CKD trial was completed at the end of 2021 with 1,480 subjects randomized. We currently anticipate that the VALOR-CKD trial will be terminated early, through an administrative stop, to occur in the second quarter of 2022, with continued accrual of primary endpoint events into the third quarter of 2022. The reporting of top-line results from the VALOR-CKD trial is anticipated to occur early in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
Acid-base balance is critical to normal cellular function and the kidneys play an important role in preserving acid-base balance, in part, by excreting acid that is generated every day through normal food intake and metabolism. As one of multiple strategies the body employs to maintain acid-base balance, acid loads are buffered by serum bicarbonate. In individuals with normal kidney function, serum bicarbonate levels are maintained in the normal range of 22 – 29 mEq/L. Metabolic acidosis is diagnosed clinically when serum bicarbonate is chronically below 22 mEq/L.
Coordinated multiorgan adaptive responses to retained acid may maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range for some period of time; however, these adaptations have serious negative consequences, including loss of bone, a negative nitrogen balance, the loss of muscle mass and strength, and progressive kidney injury. By the time serum bicarbonate levels decrease below the normal range and a clinical diagnosis of metabolic acidosis is made, defenses against acidosis may have already led to bone, muscle, and kidney damage. Thus, in patients with CKD, although serum bicarbonate is an easily measured indicator of metabolic acidosis, it provides information about the status of only a portion of the buffering capacity of the body and may indeed be a lagging indicator of acidosis. Thus, there is also a need to recognize eubicarbonatemic acidosis, or latent acidosis, in patients with normal serum bicarbonate concentrations.
The importance of managing metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD has been noted in both national and international kidney disease treatment guidelines that recommend dietary changes and oral alkali intervention, such as sodium bicarbonate, when serum bicarbonate falls below 22 mEq/L. There is also an understanding by most nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression and improve bone and muscle health. In spite of this, several analyses of retrospective databases suggest that metabolic acidosis has gone largely untreated. We believe that this treatment gap is due in large part to the lack of an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis that can be used in the broad population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. We believe that the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer’s target product profile and the potential health and economic benefits from slowing CKD progression through the treatment of metabolic acidosis provide a significant opportunity for veverimer in the U.S. market, if approved.
Veverimer is a non-absorbed, low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. Veverimer is uniquely designed to specifically bind and remove hydrochloric acid, or HCI, from the GI tract. Acid binding and removal from the GI tract is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. Veverimer’s high 
amine content provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq per gram of polymer. The size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for HCI binding. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. In our Phase 3 clinical trials, veverimer has been administered at an initial dose of 6 grams once a day as a suspension in 2 ounces of water, providing a theoretical proton binding capacity of approximately 60 mEq. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 mEq, per kilogram, or kg, of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults.
Veverimer is an in-house discovered, new chemical entity. We have a broad intellectual property estate that we believe will provide patent protection for veverimer until at least 2038 in the United States, at least 2035 in Australia, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico and Russia and until at least 2034 in South Korea and certain other markets.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize veverimer as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for slowing CKD progression through the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD and, if successful, continue to examine the opportunity to slow CKD progression in patients with latent acidosis and CKD. Key elements of our strategy are to:
•Obtain FDA approval of veverimer based upon veverimer’s effect on slowing CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD.
•Expand awareness of, and educate nephrologists on, the consequences of untreated metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. Over the past four years, we have authored, co-authored or sponsored 24 peer-reviewed publications or presentations that highlight veverimer and 30 publications or presentations that highlight the serious complications of metabolic acidosis and its economic burden to the healthcare system. We have provided grants related to disease awareness and treatment of metabolic acidosis and host an educational website, MetabolicAcidosisInsights.com, for nephrologists and healthcare providers that offers resources and information related to metabolic acidosis. 
•Commercialize veverimer in the United States. If veverimer is approved by the FDA, we plan to initially commercialize it in the United States by deploying a specialty sales force targeting that subset of nephrologists most focused on treating patients with CKD. With this approach, we believe we can reach a majority of the approximately 700,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD that are cared for by nephrologists. Additionally, we may seek to commercialize veverimer in the United States with one or more partners to obtain access to primary care physicians, cardiologists, and/or endocrinologists.
•Expand veverimer development. Provided we demonstrate that veverimer slows CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD in the VALOR-CKD trial, we may pursue additional clinical trials to evaluate veverimer’s ability to slow CKD progression in patients with latent acidosis and CKD.
•Commercialize veverimer outside of the United States with one or more partners. Based on the prevalence of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for veverimer in markets outside the United States. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can commercialize veverimer in target markets.
Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis Represent a Major Health Crisis
Overview of CKD
CKD is a serious condition characterized by the gradual loss of essential kidney functions over time. CKD is most commonly caused by diabetes or hypertension. In patients with CKD, normal fluid and electrolyte balance can no longer be maintained, and the excretion of metabolic end products, toxins and drugs is impaired. Furthermore, production and secretion of certain enzymes and hormones are disturbed.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, 37 million people in the United States are afflicted with CKD, representing an overall prevalence in the adult population of approximately 15%. For beneficiaries with CKD who do not have end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, annual fee for service, or FFS, Medicare expenses in 2019 totaled approximately $87.2 billion, representing 23% of total Medicare FFS spending. For patients with ESRD, 
total Medicare-related expenditures were $51.0 billion in 2019. ESRD is total and permanent kidney failure that is treated with kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant. There are approximately 809,000 people in the United States living on kidney dialysis and approximately 135,000 new ESRD cases occur annually. According to the 2021 United States Renal Data System report, there were approximately 105,000 deaths from ESRD in 2019. There is a significant medical need to slow progression of kidney disease and reduce the number of patients progressing to kidney failure.
To help improve the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation, or NKF, has divided CKD into five stages. The severity of CKD at each stage is identified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Treatment during the first four stages of CKD focuses on ways to preserve kidney function for as long as possible. ESRD is the final stage of CKD in which the patient typically requires renal replacement therapy, i.e., dialysis or a kidney transplant, for survival.
Stages of CKD
Overview of Metabolic Acidosis
Diabetes and hypertension have long been recognized as modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD. More recently, metabolic acidosis, a serious condition in which the body has accumulated too much acid, has also been identified as a key modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD.
Metabolic acidosis in CKD develops when excess acid is retained in the body. Acid-base balance is critical to normal cellular function because many essential cellular processes, metabolic enzymes, and transmembrane transport processes are highly pH sensitive. The kidneys play an important role in preserving acid-base balance in the body, in part, by excreting acid that is generated every day through daily dietary intake and metabolism of proteins, phospholipids, and nucleic acids. In individuals with normal kidney function, the kidney excretes the produced acid and thereby maintains net acid balance. As one of multiple strategies the body employs for acid-base balance, acid loads are buffered by serum bicarbonate, with its titration to CO2 and H2O resulting in a reduction in its concentration. To maintain physiologic pH and normal serum bicarbonate levels in the setting of continuous acid production, consumed bicarbonate must be regenerated by the kidneys and/or replenished through bicarbonate-producing dietary components. The kidneys regenerate and replace bicarbonate that was consumed in buffering the ongoing acid

production through the excretion of added acid. Acid excretion is accomplished by two mechanisms, both of which rely on normal kidney tubular function: 1) production and excretion in the urine of ammonium; and 2) excretion of acid as titratable acid (protons bound to non-chloride anions). In individuals with normal kidney function, where acid excretion normally matches metabolic acid production to maintain net acid balance, serum bicarbonate levels are maintained in the normal range of 22 – 29 mEq/L. Metabolic acidosis is diagnosed clinically when serum bicarbonate is chronically below 22 mEq/L. 
Patients with CKD have a reduced number of functioning nephrons available to excrete acid, resulting in a decreased capacity to excrete acid. As GFR declines progressively, the kidneys eventually excrete less acid than the body generates, leading to retained acid. Accumulating acid can be sequestered away from plasma into interstitial fluid and into the intracellular space to bind with cellular buffers including proteins, phosphate, and titration of cellular bicarbonate. However, maintaining acid-base balance involves eventual removal of accumulated acid from the body with replacement of bicarbonate that had been consumed by acid titration. To this end, protein in muscle is consumed to produce ammonium that is needed to excrete the accumulating acid and is metabolized to produce bicarbonate to help replace that titrated to CO2 and H2O by the accumulating acid. Continued muscle protein breakdown leads to decreasing muscle mass with decreasing muscle function and strength. In addition, bone alkali and mineral bind and buffer acid, leading to their consumption in the process, and mitigate against the adverse effects of accumulating acid but lead to decreasing bone mineral content and bone strength. 
Kidney tubules contain multiple sensors that monitor intracellular, intraluminal, and blood pH as well as blood and intraluminal bicarbonate levels and blood CO2. The effector function of these sensors in settings of a low blood pH (acidemia) results in H+ excretion either directly via tubular transporters or indirectly by stimulation of paracrine hormones, notably endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and aldosterone, which in turn upregulate tubular transport mechanisms that facilitate acid excretion. These mechanisms to promote acid excretion are initially adaptive but can become maladaptive when these mechanisms remain chronically engaged, as with a chronic acid challenge like that provided by acid-producing, Western type diets, and can contribute to kidney function decline.
While these coordinated multiorgan adaptive responses to metabolic acidosis partially correct the acidosis and may maintain the serum bicarbonate in the normal range for some period of time in patients with CKD, these adaptations have serious negative consequences, including loss of bone, a negative nitrogen balance, the loss of muscle mass and strength, and progressive kidney injury. As a corollary, by the time serum bicarbonate levels decrease below the normal range and a clinical diagnosis of metabolic acidosis is made, defenses against acidosis may have already led to bone, muscle, and kidney damage. Thus, in patients with CKD, although serum bicarbonate is an easily measured indicator of metabolic acidosis, it provides information about the status of only a portion of the buffering capacity of the body and may indeed be a lagging indicator of acidosis. Thus, there is also a need to recognize and potentially treat latent acidosis in patients with normal serum bicarbonate concentrations.
In Patients with CKD, Acid (H+) Retention is Mitigated by Multiple Biological Strategies

Prevalence of Metabolic Acidosis
The prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis in people with CKD progressively rises as kidney function declines. We estimate the prevalence of metabolic acidosis to be approximately 8% of the estimated 21 million people with Stage 1 and 2 CKD, 13% of the estimated 16 million patients with Stage 3 CKD, and 36% of the estimated 1.2 million patients with Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD (non-dialysis patients), resulting in a total estimated prevalence of approximately 4.3 million patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD in the United States.
Metabolic Acidosis Poses a Health Risk to Approximately 4.3 Million Patients with CKD in the United States
Current Clinical Situation
The importance of managing metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD has been noted in both national and international kidney disease treatment guidelines. The NKF’s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, or KDOQI, guidelines and the International Society of Nephology’s Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, guidelines suggest that in patients with CKD, serum bicarbonate be maintained above 22 mEq/L. Serum bicarbonate concentrations <22 mEq/L are associated with increased risk of CKD progression and increased risk of death.
We believe several prospective clinical studies have shown that treating metabolic acidosis can slow the progression of CKD, and that multiple retrospective studies provide qualitative and quantitative evidence for the relationship between metabolic acidosis and the risk of progression of CKD across a wide range of baseline eGFRs and serum bicarbonate levels. 
In particular, five prospective trials (Garneata et al., 2016; de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010; Dubey et al., 2018; Di Iorio et al., 2019) studying patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD and metabolic acidosis demonstrated slowing of CKD progression following an increase in serum bicarbonate with three different interventions, comprising a very low-protein diet, oral sodium bicarbonate and oral sodium citrate. Increases in serum bicarbonate resulted in improved clinical outcomes, including fewer patients who progressed to ESRD and/or experienced significant declines of eGFR. Additionally, clinical trials reported by Goraya et al., 2013 and 2014 and Mahajan et al., 2010 showed that, in patients with Stages 2 to 4 CKD due to hypertensive nephropathy, increasing serum bicarbonate levels with sodium bicarbonate or a low protein diet rich in fruits and vegetables resulted in reduced markers of kidney injury and slower decline in eGFR. It should be noted that these trials were open-label trials that generally did not enroll patients with diabetes, heart failure, edema, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease, and other conditions 
related to sodium sensitive comorbidities. As such, the patients in these trials did not fully represent the general population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. It is estimated that approximately 90% of late-stage patients with CKD have sodium sensitive comorbidities.
Four large published retrospective database analyses show an association between higher serum bicarbonate levels and slower progression of CKD, independent of baseline eGFR and other factors such as age, sex, proteinuria, hypertension and diabetes (Dobre et al., 2013; Raphael et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2009; Tangri et al., 2011). In these four distinct large cohorts of patients with CKD, the analyses all demonstrate that clinical outcomes for patients with CKD with serum bicarbonate levels that are below normal (i.e., <22 mEq/L) are significantly worse compared to patients with normal serum bicarbonate levels (i.e., 22 to 29 mEq/L).
Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis. Kidney disease treatment guidelines suggest treating metabolic acidosis when serum bicarbonate falls below 22 mEq/L, but in the absence of an FDA-approved treatment, physicians are left with recommending either dietary changes to mitigate acid retention or unapproved, over-the-counter supplements, for example sodium bicarbonate, that have not undergone the scrutiny of rigorous clinical examination, including evaluation of safety, efficacy and their interactions with other drugs. 
Several analyses of retrospective databases show that, despite its prevalence, metabolic acidosis has gone largely untreated. One recent analysis of the diagnosis and treatment rates of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD indicates that it is both underdiagnosed and undertreated. At the ASN Kidney Week 2019 Meeting, Dr. Tangri, presented an analysis of data from the Symphony Health Solutions Integrated Dataverse®, or IDV, which quantified the diagnosis and treatment rates of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. This analysis, which was derived from a cohort of approximately 87,000 patients, showed that only 21% of patients with confirmed laboratory evidence of metabolic acidosis and CKD had been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis and only 15% of these patients had been treated for metabolic acidosis. 
Three other analyses indicate that oral alkali supplements are used in less than 10% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. An evaluation of data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort, or CRIC, study (Dobre et al., 2012) showed that less than 3%, or 28 of 1,039 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate levels ≤22mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. A retrospective cohort study of adults in Manitoba, Canada, (Tangri 2022, data on file), concluded that less than 8.7% of 3,223 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate values between 12-22 mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. Because the Canadian health care system includes oral alkali supplements in their formulary, the analysis included an evaluation of the adherence to oral alkali supplements. The data show that 85% of these patients had discontinued oral alkali therapy after two years. The use of oral alkali supplements in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD who were enrolled in the TRCA-301 clinical trial was less than 8.8% of subjects enrolled in the study (Wesson et al., 2019).
Oral Alkali Use is Low in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis and CKD
Our primary research indicates that most nephrologists understand the importance of treating metabolic acidosis to slow kidney disease progression, yet the analyses of actual treatment rates indicate a serious gap between the understanding and actual diagnosis and treatment. We believe that this gap is due to the lack of an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis that can be used in the broad population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. 
The low use of oral alkali supplements may be explained by the lack of supportive data from blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that confirm the efficacy and safety of these unapproved supplements. While clinical research studies conducted in carefully selected patient populations have shown that oral alkali supplementation can result in slowing of CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis, two recent multicenter, placebo-controlled studies that used doses of sodium bicarbonate typically used in clinical practice, i.e., 0.5 to 1.0 grams, three times daily, both achieved very little difference in mean serum bicarbonate level between the active and placebo groups (approximately 1 mEq/L difference after 2 years) and showed no clinical benefits of sodium bicarbonate treatment (the BiCARB study group 2020, Melamed et al., 2020). The doses of sodium bicarbonate used in these trials may not have been large enough to achieve sufficient separation in serum bicarbonate in active- versus placebo-treated subjects. These doses may have been chosen because of concern for the deleterious effect of sodium that is delivered with orally administered alkali supplements, particularly in the CKD patient population. Each gram of sodium bicarbonate delivers 274 mg of sodium.
Approximately 90% of patients with later-stage CKD suffer from sodium-sensitive comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure or edema, and require a sodium-restricted diet. KDIGO guidelines recommend that patients with CKD consume less than 2 grams of total sodium per day, but according to the CDC, the average diet in the United States includes approximately 3.4 grams of sodium each day. It has been demonstrated that achieving a 2 to 3 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate requires 4 to 6 grams of sodium bicarbonate (for an 80 kg patient) which results in an additional 1.1 to 1.6 grams of sodium added to the patient’s daily intake (Abramowitz et al., 2013).
The effects of oral alkali supplementation on overall health and wellbeing also require further evaluation. One of the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo (The BiCARB study group 2020) was commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health 
Technology Assessment Programme to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate in the management of older people with CKD and mild metabolic acidosis. The trial enrolled 300 non-dialysis patients with Stage 4 or 5 CKD with serum bicarbonate concentrations <22 mEq/L recruited from 27 sites in the United Kingdom. Subjects were randomized to treatment with approximately 1.5 to 3 grams of sodium bicarbonate per day or placebo. The primary outcome and additional outcome measures were designed to assess physical function improvements and health related quality of life measures. Following 12 months of treatment, there was no significant treatment effect for the primary outcome of the between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery at 12 months (-0.4 points; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.1, p=0.15). There was no significant treatment benefit seen for any of the secondary outcomes. Adverse events were more frequent in the sodium bicarbonate arm (457 versus 400) and the time to commencing renal replacement therapy was similar in both groups (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.02, p=0.43). Sodium bicarbonate provided no significant treatment effect and adverse events were more frequent in the bicarbonate arm. Health economic analysis showed lower quality of life and higher costs in the sodium bicarbonate arm at one year. In addition, placebo dominated sodium bicarbonate for all sensitivity analyses of incremental cost-effectiveness. The discontinuation rates in the BICARB trial were 25% and 30% at Year 1 in the sodium bicarbonate group and placebo group, respectively, and 47% and 46% at Year 2 in the sodium bicarbonate group and placebo group, respectively. 
Effects of sodium bicarbonate treatment on GI tolerability, blood pressure and volume status have been observed in some clinical trials. For example, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label single-site study conducted by Dubey et al., 2018, six months of treatment with sodium bicarbonate was less well tolerated than placebo. This study evaluated a broader population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. Overall, adverse events occurred in significantly (p=0.01) more subjects in the sodium bicarbonate group compared to the control group. The safety profile of oral sodium bicarbonate showed that more subjects experienced GI side effects, fluid retention and worsening hypertension compared to placebo, despite significantly higher use of diuretics in the sodium bicarbonate group (p=0.008).
The use of sodium-based alkali supplements may also impact the effectiveness of other medications important to the treatment of many patients with CKD. In particular, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, or RAASi, are one of the few classes of agents that have been proven to slow CKD progression. Higher sodium intake has been associated with significant reductions in the effectiveness of RAASi. A study by Lambers Heerspink and colleagues (Lambers Heerspink et al., 2012) evaluated the impact of low, medium and high levels of 24-hour sodium/creatinine ratio in patients administered angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs, versus non-RAASi treated patients. They concluded that “The renal and cardiovascular protective effects of ARB therapy compared with non-RAASi-based therapy attenuated in subjects with larger consumption of sodium so that in subjects with the highest sodium intake the treatment effects on hard renal and cardiovascular outcomes were completely annihilated.” Approximately 70% of patients with CKD are treated with RAASi to manage their hypertension.
Given the lack of a proven safe and efficacious agent to treat metabolic acidosis, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for an FDA-approved agent to chronically treat metabolic acidosis in the approximately 4.3 million patients in the United States that are afflicted with metabolic acidosis and CKD. 
Our Solution—Veverimer
Veverimer is a novel, non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer that is designed to bind HCI in the GI tract and remove it from the body through excretion in the feces, thereby decreasing the total amount of acid in the body. Veverimer is administered orally as a suspension in water. Veverimer removes acid from the GI tract without delivering additional sodium or other counterions; if approved, veverimer would allow for the chronic treatment of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with common sodium-sensitive comorbidities such as hypertension, edema and heart failure.
Veverimer Target Product Profile
We have designed veverimer to target the following product profile:
•Effectively Treat Metabolic Acidosis: Bind and remove sufficient amounts of acid such that a majority of the patients will achieve a clinically meaningful increase in serum bicarbonate. Subject to the results of our renal outcomes clinical trial, VALOR-CKD, veverimer may also slow the progression of CKD through the treatment of metabolic acidosis.
•Well-Tolerated: Based on our long-term TRCA-301E trial results, patients reported GI-related adverse events at a similar rate to placebo. These events were generally mild, self-limited and did not require dose adjustment of veverimer.
•Suitable for a Broad Population of Patients, including Patients with Sodium-Sensitive Comorbidities: Treat metabolic acidosis without delivering sodium or other counterions.
•Compatible with Other Medications: Allow concomitant dosing of common CKD medications. Veverimer’s unique characteristics include a particle size designed to prevent systemic absorption and size-exclusion that provides high selectivity for HCI.
•Convenient, Once-Daily, Oral Administration: In our TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, subjects self-administered 3-, 6- or 9-gram doses suspended in 2 ounces of water, once daily, with high overall compliance.
•Room-Temperature Stable: We anticipate labeling commercial material with a 24-month shelf-life at room temperature supported by data from ongoing registration stability studies demonstrating that veverimer is stable at room temperature for at least 36 months.
Veverimer Mechanism of Action
The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include daily dietary intake and metabolism of proteins, phospholipids, and nucleic acids. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 mEq per kg of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults. Prior studies with alkali supplementation have shown that neutralization of 40% to 80% (20 to 80 mEq) of the daily acid produced can increase serum bicarbonate levels (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010).
Veverimer is a non-absorbed, low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. Veverimer is uniquely designed to specifically bind and remove HCl from the GI tract. Acid binding and removal from the GI tract is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. Veverimer’s high amine content provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq, per gram of polymer. The size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for HCI binding. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. In our Phase 3 clinical trials, veverimer has been administered at an initial dose of 6 grams once a day as a suspension in 2 ounces of water, providing a theoretical proton binding capacity of approximately 60 mEq.
The mechanism of action of veverimer is illustrated below:
Veverimer Mechanism of Action
Veverimer Clinical Development Program
Overview
The veverimer development program was initially designed to obtain approval of veverimer pursuant to the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program. To that end, our completed clinical trials were designed to evaluate the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate. We believe that serum bicarbonate is an appropriate surrogate endpoint because it is reasonably likely to predict slowing of CKD progression. As part of the Accelerated Approval Program, the FDA required that we initiate a confirmatory postmarketing trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of veverimer on CKD progression. The safety and efficacy trials in our development program for veverimer include a completed 135-subject, Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101; a completed 217-subject, Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301; a completed 196-subject, Phase 3 extension trial, TRCA-301E; and our ongoing renal outcomes trial, VALOR-CKD.
TRCA-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
In 2016, we completed TRCA-101, a 135-subject, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 trial. Subjects with Stage 3 or 4 CKD and serum bicarbonate levels between 12 and 20 mEq/L were randomized to receive either placebo or one of four different dosing regimens of veverimer (1.5, 3 or 4.5 grams twice daily or 6 grams once daily) for two weeks. The appearance and weight of the placebo used was not identical to those of veverimer. Therefore, in each study, the personnel at the study site and at the CRO who had responsibilities related to the study drug had no other responsibilities in the trial and were designated as unblinded. The investigators, subjects, and all other site and CRO staff were blinded throughout the trial. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of veverimer, and the secondary objective was to evaluate its efficacy. Veverimer was well-tolerated. All subjects completed treatment and treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were mild or moderate; there were no serious adverse events. The most common TEAE was diarrhea which was reported by 20.2% of veverimer-treated subjects as compared to 12.9% of subjects in the placebo group. All cases of diarrhea were mild, self-limited, and none required treatment. There were no apparent effects of veverimer on serum parameters that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer and no apparent effects on vital signs or body weight. Statistically significant increases in serum bicarbonate levels were observed in all veverimer-treated groups within 24 to 72 hours of initiation of therapy. After 14 days of treatment, the mean increase in serum bicarbonate levels from baseline in each of the veverimer-treated groups was between 2.95 and 3.83 mEq/L, with a mean serum bicarbonate increase of 3.3 mEq/L in the combined veverimer group. All these results were statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001), as were the increases from baseline as compared to the placebo group, whose mean serum bicarbonate level decreased by 0.18 mEq/L. The serum bicarbonate levels of all subjects were measured during the off-treatment follow-up period. In the veverimer-treated 
groups, the mean levels had reverted to near baseline levels after two weeks off treatment. The results of this trial were published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (Bushinsky, et al., 2018).
TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In 2018, we completed TRCA-301, a 217-subject, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. Subjects had Stage 3b or 4 CKD and serum bicarbonate levels between 12 and 20 mEq/L;190 were enrolled in Eastern Europe and 27 were enrolled in the United States. Subjects were randomized in a 4:3 ratio to receive once-daily, or QD, veverimer or placebo. Subjects in the active group initially received a QD dose of 6 grams of veverimer and blinded dose adjustments (3, 6, 9 grams of veverimer QD) were allowed during the trial to attempt to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range. Subjects were permitted to continue their existing oral alkali supplement during the trial, provided dosing remained stable. The protocols for placebo dosing and blinding used in this study were similar to those followed in TRCA-101.
The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieving a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, at the end of the 12-week treatment period. The secondary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Both the primary and secondary endpoints were met with high significance (p < 0.0001): 59.2% of subjects in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 22.5% of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L. The least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in serum bicarbonate was 4.42 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. 
Veverimer was well tolerated and over 95% of subjects in each of the groups completed the trial. There were two deaths in the trial, and both of these occurred in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and balanced in the two treatment groups. The types of serious adverse events were consistent with those expected in the study population, and none of the serious adverse events were assessed to be related to treatment by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate GI disorders, which occurred in 5.4% of subjects in the placebo group and 12.9% of veverimer-treated subjects. The treatment-related GI adverse events that occurred in more than one subject in the trial included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and constipation. The only other treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than one subject was paresthesia (1.1% of subjects in the placebo group and 0.8% of veverimer-treated subjects). There were no apparent effects of veverimer on serum parameters that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer. A high serum bicarbonate level, defined as greater than 30 mEq/L, was observed transiently in 2 subjects, or 0.9%. Discontinuation of veverimer per the protocol-defined dosing algorithm resulted in normalization of serum bicarbonate in these subjects.
TRCA-301E Extension Trial
In 2019, we completed TRCA-301E, a blinded, 40-week extension of the 12-week TRCA-301 trial. One hundred ninety-six subjects (196; 94.2%), (114 in the veverimer group and 82 in the placebo group) elected and were qualified to continue from the TRCA-301 trial into the extension trial. One hundred eleven (111; 97.4%) subjects in the veverimer group and 74 (90.2%) subjects in placebo group completed the overall one-year treatment period. In the TRCA-301E trial, 179 of the subjects were located in Eastern Europe and 17 were located in the United States.
The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was an assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer. In the veverimer group versus placebo, we observed similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (81.3% versus 80.2%), fewer serious adverse events (1.8% versus 4.9%), and fewer adverse events leading to discontinuation (0 versus 1.2%). In addition, in the veverimer group (versus placebo) there were fewer subjects who discontinued study treatment (2.6% versus 9.8%) and a comparable rate of GI adverse events (21.4% versus 25.9%). No serious adverse events were assessed to be related to study drug by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. The statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial also specified a safety analysis of the time to first occurrence of any event in the composite of death from any cause, renal replacement therapy or a ≥ 50% decline in eGFR, (taken together, DD50) over the combined 52-week treatment period. The time to DD50 was shorter in placebo versus veverimer-treated subjects (p = 0.0224). 
The secondary endpoints of the TRCA-301E trial assessed the durability of the effect of veverimer on serum bicarbonate levels and on subjective and objective measures of physical function. All were met with statistical significance. In veverimer-treated subjects, the proportion of subjects achieving an increase of at least 4 mEq/L or normalization of serum bicarbonate was similar at Week 12 and Week 52 (61% and 63%, respectively). Similarly, the 
magnitude of the change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to Week 12 and to Week 52 were similar in veverimer-treated subjects (4.6 mEq/L and 4.7 mEq/L, respectively). However, rather than remaining stable, the corresponding values for the placebo group increased from Week 12 to Week 52 (22% and 38%; 1.8 mEq/L and 2.7 mEq/L, respectively). Measures of physical function were assessed through the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test. Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey was significantly greater in the veverimer group (11.4 points) compared to the placebo group (-0.7 points), with a between-group difference of 12.1 points in favor of veverimer (p<0.0001). The 11.4-point improvement in the veverimer group exceeded the 3- to 5-point change cited in the literature as the minimal clinically important difference for KDQOL subscales. Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in physical function using the Repeated Chair Stand Test was also significantly greater in the veverimer group (4.3 seconds faster) compared to the placebo group (1.4 seconds faster), with a between-group difference of 2.9 seconds in favor of veverimer (p<0.0001). The 4.3-second improvement in the time to complete the Repeated Chair Stand Test exceeded the 1.8-second improvement cited in the literature as the minimal clinically important difference for improvement in this measure of objective physical function.
Clinical Pharmacology Studies
Veverimer is not systemically absorbed; therefore, its potential for drug-drug interactions, or DDIs, is limited to those that occur in the GI tract (i.e., direct binding or indirect effects resulting from transient increases in gastric pH). We assessed the potential for DDIs with veverimer both in vitro and in vivo in healthy subjects. 
In vitro binding to veverimer was evaluated with 16 drugs of varying molecular weight and charge. Human DDI studies were conducted with the 2 drugs (furosemide, aspirin) that showed the most in vitro binding to veverimer. The effect of veverimer on gastric pH was measured continuously in vivo in healthy subjects using a microelectrode pH probe placed in the gastric compartment. Human DDI studies were conducted with 3 orally administered drugs with pH-dependent solubility (dabigatran, furosemide, warfarin).
Veverimer did not bind to any of the positively charged, neutral or zwitterionic drugs tested in vitro. It bound to three small (Molecular Weight <332 Da), negatively charged drugs (aspirin, ethacrynic acid, furosemide); these interactions were reduced or eliminated in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of chloride. We tested aspirin and furosemide in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers and these drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with veverimer.
Veverimer increased gastric pH by approximately 3 and 1.5 pH units in fasted and fed subjects, respectively. The increase in gastric pH was short-lived, with a peak within 1 hour after dosing and a return to baseline after approximately 1.5 hours and approximately 3 hours under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. The effect of veverimer on gastric pH was similar in the presence and absence of omeprazole. The bioavailability of orally administered drugs that are weak acids and weak bases can be affected by changes in gastric pH. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the transient increase in gastric pH caused by veverimer was evaluated in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers using three drugs with pH-dependent solubility: furosemide (weak acid), dabigatran (weak base) and warfarin (weak acid). These drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with veverimer.
Based on the results of our DDI studies, we do not believe we need to recommend dosing separation for co-administered drugs with veverimer, either due to direct binding interactions or due to pH sensitivity. We believe it is reasonable to propose dosing instructions for veverimer that do not include any dose separation recommendations for other oral medications. However, if veverimer is approved for use by the FDA, the ultimate instructions in the prescribing information regarding co-administration of veverimer with other oral medications will be subject to FDA review and approval.
Veverimer Nonclinical Studies 
We have conducted in vivo and in vitro studies to assess the mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of veverimer. In vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated robust proton and chloride binding and retention by the veverimer polymer resulting in removal of HCI from the body. In vitro studies demonstrated that veverimer can selectively bind and retain chloride under conditions that mimic the pH, transit times, and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract. The marked binding capacity and selectivity for chloride observed with veverimer in vitro translates into in vivo pharmacological effects. Removal of acid by veverimer results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum bicarbonate, as observed in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and low serum bicarbonate. A significant increase in fecal chloride relative to controls suggests that veverimer retained its 
functional integrity during transit through the rat GI tract. Safety pharmacology assessments of the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and GI systems did not identify any veverimer-related adverse effects at oral doses up to 4 g/kg (central nervous system, respiratory) and up to 2 g/kg (GI) in rats and at 2 g/kg (cardiovascular) in dogs. Lack of veverimer absorption from the GI tract was demonstrated in both rats and dogs administered a single oral dose of radiolabeled [14 C]-veverimer, consistent with the physicochemical properties of veverimer (insolubility in aqueous and organic solvents, particle size averaging 100 micrometers in diameter, and particle stability). Repeat-dose, GLP toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks duration in rats and 39 weeks duration in dogs demonstrated that veverimer has a very low order of toxicity and was well tolerated. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs and local GI tolerance was good. The no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, in both the rat and dog in the chronic toxicity studies was the highest dose of 2 g/kg/day; this dose of veverimer is 13-fold higher than the highest proposed human dose of 9 g/day (0.15 g/kg/day based on a 60-kg patient). We also established that the polymer has no effect on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D2, D3, and E. Reproductive toxicity studies indicate there are no adverse veverimer-related effects on maternal reproductive function. Upon a resubmission of our NDA for veverimer, we are prepared to discuss the embryofetal development and teratogenicity data with the FDA with respect to pregnancy label language. We do not expect these discussions to lead to any change in the pregnancy risk statement in the anticipated label due to the non-absorbed nature of veverimer. Veverimer was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in genotoxicity studies. Given the non-absorbed nature of veverimer, we were granted a waiver from FDA for fertility and early embryonic development (Segment I) and peri/postnatal development (Segment III) reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.
Veverimer Regulatory Pathway
Our regulatory goal is to obtain FDA approval of veverimer based on data from our VALOR-CKD trial that we believe will demonstrate veverimer's effect on slowing CKD progression through the treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD.
We previously submitted our New Drug Application, or NDA, for veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program in August 2019 based on data from our TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial showing the treatment effect of veverimer on the surrogate marker of serum bicarbonate. In August 2020, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA. According to the CRL, the FDA sought additional data beyond the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial regarding the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect of veverimer on the surrogate marker of serum bicarbonate and expressed concern regarding whether the demonstrated effect size would be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In addition, the CRL questioned the applicability of the treatment effect to the U.S. population and the practice of medicine in the United States. The FDA also expressed concern as to the reliability of the findings given that the findings for the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial were driven by a single, high-enrolling trial site located in Eastern Europe.
In December 2020, we submitted a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR, requesting that the Office of New Drugs, or OND, find that the magnitude of serum bicarbonate change seen in the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with CKD and that it can therefore serve as the basis for accelerated approval. In February 2021, the OND issued an Appeal Denied Letter, or ADL. The OND acknowledged that the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial met its serum bicarbonate endpoints with statistical significance, but concluded that the magnitude of these increases in serum bicarbonate levels were not of sufficient size or duration to establish that treatment with veverimer would be reasonably likely to provide a discernible reduction in CKD progression. In addition, the OND found that the intended confirmatory trial, VALOR-CKD, was underpowered to detect a 13% reduction in slowing of CKD progression. The OND also noted concerns around adequate blinding, the trial results being strongly influenced by a single site, and the majority of sites for the TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial being in Eastern Europe, where differences in patient management, including concomitant medications and diet, might affect the treatment response to veverimer and raise a concern of the applicability to a U.S. patient population. Based on the CRL and ADL, we no longer believed it was practical to pursue approval for veverimer on the basis of serum bicarbonate data alone and we focused our attention on pursuing approval for veverimer based on outcomes data from the VALOR-CKD trial. 
To satisfy the requirements for traditional approval we will be required to provide the FDA with sufficient data about clinical efficacy and safety to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of veverimer and to provide adequate information for the labeling of veverimer. In most cases, the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. We believe that positive results on the primary endpoint of DD40 from the VALOR-CKD trial, as well as previously submitted data from our TRCA-301/TRCA-301E trial, may enable a resubmission of our NDA through the traditional approval pathway.
We intend to reengage with the FDA after we obtain results from the VALOR-CKD trial. At that time, we will discuss options for the potential resubmission of the NDA. The FDA’s acceptance of the VALOR-CKD data in support of traditional approval will depend on the robustness of the data as well as a number of other factors, including consistency of findings across countries and regions where the study is being conducted, the absolute number and proportion of patients from the U.S. or regions with “U.S.-like” patients, the applicability of the findings to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, consistency with FDA policies with respect to approval based on a single clinical trial and the adequacy of study closeout procedures with respect to providing sufficiently complete and interpretable data, reducing the risk of missing data required for key efficacy analyses, and maintaining the integrity of the trial. Resubmission and approval of the veverimer NDA could also require additional clinical data beyond that provided by the VALOR-CKD trial.
Our Ongoing VALOR-CKD Renal Outcomes Trial 
The protocol for the VALOR-CKD trial was designed in collaboration with a Steering Committee of international key opinion leaders in the fields of chronic kidney disease progression and metabolic acidosis and with input from the FDA. It is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (eGFR of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L). The eligibility criteria for the VALOR-CKD trial are similar to those used in our TRCA-301 trial. Based on observations from the TRCA-301 trial, we strengthened the screening requirements in the VALOR-CKD trial to enable enrollment of subjects with confirmed metabolic acidosis at baseline. In the VALOR-CKD trial, subjects are treated with veverimer (3, 6 or 9 g QD) or placebo, with titration to attempt to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L). The protocols for placebo dosing and blinding used in this study were similar to those followed in TRCA-101.
VALOR-CKD Renal Outcomes Trial
The primary endpoint of the VALOR-CKD trial compares the time to first renal event, with a renal event defined as a confirmed ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR, ESRD, or renal death, in veverimer-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group. The VALOR-CKD trial also includes, as its first two secondary efficacy endpoints, evaluation of the effect of veverimer versus placebo after one year of treatment on patient-reported and objective measures of physical functioning, using the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand test, respectively. To control family-wise error rate, statistical hypothesis testing for the primary and secondary endpoints will use a gatekeeper procedure. Only after the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant will the hierarchical testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints be performed. If the first secondary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant, the hypothesis test for the second secondary efficacy endpoint will be performed, and so on in sequence for each efficacy endpoint. Although not part of any efficacy endpoints, the VALOR-CKD trial will also provide information regarding the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate in veverimer and placebo-treated subjects. Additional analyses of data from the trial will include the effect of veverimer on other CKD progression measures, as well as mortality, hospitalization and cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, laboratory outcomes will measure bone density and muscle mass, as well as changes in serum bicarbonate levels. 
The VALOR-CKD trial was designed to randomize approximately 1,600 subjects and end when the independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee positively adjudicated 511 subjects with primary endpoint events, which was anticipated to occur in the first half of 2024. However, we now anticipate that we will terminate the VALOR-CKD trial pursuant to an administrative stop process provided in the current protocol. The exact timing of the administrative stop will be determined by our financial runway and will likely occur in the second quarter of 2022. As of March 28, 2022, the average duration of treatment in the VALOR-CKD trial was approximately 24 months and the trial had accrued 217 subjects with positively adjudicated primary endpoint events. Based on feedback from the FDA regarding our administrative stop, we halted enrollment of additional patients in the VALOR-CKD trial in the fourth quarter of 2021 to enable us to focus resources on maximizing the duration of follow-up in subjects who are currently enrolled in the trial. In total, 1480 subjects were randomized in the VALOR-CKD trial. Of these, 72% were enrolled at Eastern/Central European sites, 10% at U.S., Western European and Canadian sites, 9% at Latin American sites, and 9% at sites in the Asia-Pacific region. One site in the VALOR-CKD trial randomized 76 subjects, which is 5.1% of the 
total subjects randomized; no other site provided more than 5% of the total number of randomized subjects. The FDA’s acceptance of the VALOR-CKD data in support of an NDA resubmission, including its assessment of the magnitude and durability of the veverimer treatment effect across the various geographical regions where the study is conducted and the acceptability of the data from non-U.S. countries or regions which will comprise a substantial proportion of the data from the trial, will ultimately be a review issue.
Market Opportunity
We estimate that there are approximately 4.3 million patients in the United States afflicted with metabolic acidosis and CKD and that approximately 1.6 million of such patients are under the care of a physician. Our initial target market will be focused on the approximately 700,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD that are under the care of a nephrologist. We have identified approximately 5,000 nephrologists who treat approximately 80% of these patients. Given the demographics of the CKD patient population, these nephrologists are geographically concentrated on the west coast, the northeast and the southeast of the United States. 
We have conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists designed to understand their knowledge of the link between treating metabolic acidosis and the slowing of CKD progression. In our most recent survey conducted in 2021, 86% of the 71 nephrologists surveyed indicated that they strongly agreed (58%) or agreed (28%) that metabolic acidosis is an independent and modifiable risk factor for CKD progression. 
We have also conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists to quantify the expected market for veverimer, if approved. In a survey of 71 nephrologists, conducted in 2021, 93% indicated that they would definitely or probably prescribe veverimer, based on a veverimer target product profile which included significantly reduced progression of CKD with a projected treatment effect that yielded an estimated hazard ratio of 0.73, as well as physical function and safety information from the results of our TRCA-301E clinical trial that were published in The Lancet in June 2019.
Beyond the nephrologist market, we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for veverimer by non-nephrologists, including primary care physicians, cardiologists and endocrinologists. We conducted a survey in 2021 of 91 non-nephrologist physicians to obtain their level of understanding of metabolic acidosis and its link to CKD progression and to quantify the expected market for veverimer, if approved, by non-nephrologist physicians. Approximately 70% of primary care physicians, 63% of cardiologists and 57% of endocrinologists strongly agreed or agreed that metabolic acidosis is an independent and modifiable risk factor for CKD progression. Moreover, 71% of non-nephrologist physicians indicated that they would definitely or probably prescribe veverimer, based on a veverimer target product profile which included a statistically significantly reduction in the progression of CKD with a projected treatment effect that yielded an estimated hazard ratio of 0.73, as well as improved physical function and safety data from our TRCA-301E clinical trial as published in The Lancet in June 2019.
We have also evaluated, through health and economic outcomes analyses, the potential savings to third-party payers and health benefits that could be derived through the treatment of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. In 2019, we completed a retrospective health economic study of pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD. The study evaluated renal outcome events and healthcare costs for 51,558 pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD derived from electronic health records, or EHRs, and corresponding medical claims from a national de-identified electronic medical record dataset over a 10-year period (2007 to 2017). The analysis included 17,350 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD and 34,208 patients with normal serum bicarbonate and CKD. The results of the study showed the following health impacts of metabolic acidosis over a 2-year period: 
•3 times higher likelihood of death: 30.9% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline died versus 10% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline; and
•3.6 times higher likelihood of progressing to renal replacement therapy, or RRT, defined as the initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation: 19.5% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline progressed to RRT versus 5.5% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline. 
In addition, the results of the study showed that healthcare costs were approximately $40 thousand per patient per year higher for patients with metabolic acidosis versus patients that had normal serum bicarbonate levels. The potential savings to payers and health benefits derived through these analyses were independent of the patient’s status with regard to CKD stage, albumin-to-creatine ratio, sex, age, race, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension or Charlson Comorbidity Score (an index of comorbidity burden).
In a subsequent analysis of 136,067 pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD derived from electronic health records, or EHRs, and corresponding medical claims from a national de-identified electronic medical record dataset over a 12-year period (2007 to 2019), we evaluated the decline in eGFR from baseline of ≥ 40%. This evaluation included 7,874 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD and 128,193 patients with normal serum bicarbonate and CKD. The results of the study showed the following health impacts of metabolic acidosis over a 2-year period: 
•1.2 times higher likelihood to progress by 1 or more CKD stages: 67% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline progressed 1 or more stages of CKD versus 55% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline.
•1.9 times higher likelihood to experience a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from baseline: 38% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline experienced a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR versus 20% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline.
Due to the absence of an FDA-approved product for chronic metabolic acidosis, we cannot model a treated versus untreated population for these health economic studies. As such, we relied on evaluating similar patient populations, contrasting those with metabolic acidosis and those with a normal serum bicarbonate level.
Additionally, we have conducted multiple surveys of third-party payers representing healthcare coverage for over 200 million U.S. lives. Based on our surveys, as the first and only potential FDA-approved therapy for the slowing of kidney disease progression through the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, we believe the majority of third-party payers will provide coverage for veverimer, which may be subject to prior authorization and/or other forms of utilization management. We also plan to offer veverimer through both retail and specialty-pharmacy providers to help ensure appropriate physician support and patient access to therapy. In addition, we have evaluated the healthcare insurance coverage mix of our target patient population and we estimate that the majority of these patients will have healthcare insurance coverage through 1) Medicaid programs, Medicare with low-income subsidy programs or Veterans Administration/Department of Defense programs which typically cover prescriptions with a low co-pay obligation for patients or 2) a commercial healthcare insurance plan where we typically can provide co-pay assistance to patients.
Given the high unmet need for an FDA-approved chronic treatment for slowing CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, the broad understanding among nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression, the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer’s target product profile, the potential health and economic benefits from treating metabolic acidosis, and our survey results which suggest that health insurers are open to providing coverage for veverimer, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for veverimer in the United States, if approved, as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the slowing of CKD progression through the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. 
In addition, based on the prevalence of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for veverimer outside the United States, if approved. We intend to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can obtain regulatory approval and sell veverimer in target markets. We anticipate that, in certain markets, additional clinical trials of veverimer may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access.
Our assessment to date of the market opportunity for veverimer has been based on the pathophysiology of metabolic acidosis, the results from our TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials and retrospective analyses of the potential health and economic implications of metabolic acidosis. When we obtain data from our VALOR-CKD trial, we intend to continue our assessment of the market opportunity for veverimer based on results from the VALOR-CKD trial.
Commercial Strategy and Plan
The primary target market for a commercial launch of veverimer, if approved, would be the subset of 5,000 nephrologists in the United States who care for approximately 80% of the 700,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD seen by nephrologists. We also believe, however, that there is a broader commercial opportunity for veverimer, if approved, with non-nephrologists that treat a high concentration of patients with CKD, including PCPs, endocrinologists and cardiologists. Reaching the primary target market could be achieved by using a nephrologist-focused sales force. For the broader commercial opportunity, we could seek to commercialize veverimer in the United States with one or more partners. We intend to fully assess our commercial opportunity for veverimer following the evaluation of the clinical trial results of our VALOR-CKD trial.
Our efforts to date have been focused on a disease awareness campaign designed to communicate information about the pathophysiology of metabolic acidosis and the deleterious effects of chronic untreated metabolic acidosis, including its link to accelerated CKD progression and its potential impact on how patients feel and function. We have also sponsored, authored or co-authored disease-related publications and sponsored continuing medical education, or CME, courses.
We also previously engaged with third-party payers to seek favorable coverage for veverimer, if approved. Third-party payers have indicated their perception of the likelihood of veverimer coverage is influenced by the following potential attributes of veverimer: first and only FDA-approved treatment, disease modifying, safe and efficacious and significant direct healthcare cost savings. When we obtain data from our VALOR-CKD trial, we will engage with third-party payers to re-assess the ability to obtain favorable coverage for veverimer, if approved. 
Prior to the potential approval of veverimer, we anticipate facilitating medical disease state and medical-to-medical interactions, in the form Continuing Medical Education, or CME, peer to peer medical education, disease education and other educational initiatives regarding the general pathophysiology of metabolic acidosis and CKD. A number of peer-reviewed publications will also support our educational efforts at appropriate forums. We have authored or co-authored 26 peer-reviewed publications and sponsored 30 scientific meeting presentations on topics including:
•Mechanisms underlying metabolic acidosis-induced kidney damage in CKD; 
•A compilation of the clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows CKD progression; 
•A meta-analysis of the effects of treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD; 
•Health economics and clinical outcomes research related to metabolic acidosis, including retrospective cohort studies on the association of metabolic acidosis with CKD progression and mortality and cardiovascular disease in large U.S. community-based cohorts;
•A critical assessment of the data related to clinical effects of sodium from sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD-induced metabolic acidosis;
•The results of our TRCA-101, TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials; 
•The results of subgroup analyses of TRCA-301E in patients with diabetes and heart failure as well as in older patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD.
•The mechanism of action of veverimer; and
•The results of drug-drug interaction studies of veverimer.
Manufacturing
Veverimer drug substance is a room-temperature stable, free flowing powder, composed of low-swelling, polymeric beads, approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. As a non-absorbed polymeric drug, veverimer is designed to be insoluble in water and organic solvents, and is characterized by its desired function, including high HCI binding capacity and selectivity, and physical properties, such as minimal swelling. Characterization of the isolated intermediate and careful control of each process step define the structure of the polymer. Because the process to manufacture veverimer fundamentally defines the key polymer attributes for safety and efficacy, the process has been carefully monitored and optimized during scale-up.
Veverimer is manufactured using a two-step process. This two-step approach enables, in step one, the preparation of a crosslinked polymer having a high binding capacity, and in step two, further crosslinking for low swelling and selectivity for HCI binding.
The resulting veverimer drug substance is converted into drug product by filling it into packets without the addition of excipients. Veverimer drug product is stored at room temperature. The ongoing registration stability studies demonstrate that veverimer is stable at room temperature for at least 36 months, and we anticipate the stability data will enable us to indicate on our label, if approved, that veverimer is stable at room temperature for up to 24 months.
We contract with third-party service providers to manufacture veverimer drug substance and veverimer drug product and to perform analytical testing services. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with 
manufacturing experience. We developed the process to manufacture veverimer drug substance in-house and have successfully transferred it to three manufacturers. We believe that there are a limited number of experienced contract manufacturers in the world capable of manufacturing a polymeric drug substance such as veverimer. We currently rely on Patheon Austria GmbH & Co KG, or Patheon, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., as our sole supplier for drug substance manufacturing and we have used two suppliers for drug product manufacturing. We entered into a multi-year Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement with Patheon in October 2019. Patheon has agreed to manufacture and supply us with veverimer to support our initial commercialization efforts and clinical needs. We intend to initially commercialize with a single supplier for drug substance and a single supplier for drug product. Our business plan assumes that we will establish a regionally diverse and volume-appropriate portfolio of third-party manufacturers to reduce our dependency on single suppliers or sites for drug substance and drug product in the future. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials for the commercial manufacture of veverimer if it is approved by regulatory authorities.
We have validated the veverimer drug substance manufacturing process at Patheon to produce veverimer in a batch size of approximately 700 kg. The process to manufacture drug product has also been validated. In addition, we have manufactured sufficient amounts of drug substance to support our ongoing VALOR-CKD trial through the conclusion of the trial, as well as the initial anticipated commercial launch demand for veverimer, if approved. However, at this time, further increases in our drug substance manufacturing capacity will be required to meet our future anticipated commercial demand for veverimer, if approved.
Polymeric-based drugs like veverimer generally require large quantities of drug substance, as compared to small molecule drugs. Accordingly, we will require larger scale and/or multiple manufacturers of, or multiple sites for, drug substance and drug product in order to manufacture sufficient quantities of veverimer to meet our anticipated market demand. We believe that our current production process can be optimized to meet our anticipated commercial needs without introducing changes to key veverimer properties, including binding capacity, selectivity for HCI and non-absorption. We use acid binding, competitive anion binding and particle size measurement assays to confirm these properties. We plan to continue manufacturing process development to increase annual manufacturing capacity and reduce manufacturing costs by increasing scale, decreasing processing time, and improving process controls. Additionally, we plan to continue working to secure a second drug substance manufacturer to meet forecasted commercial demand for veverimer, if approved.
Our third-party service providers, their facilities and the veverimer used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The facilities manufacturing and testing our products must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of veverimer to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of veverimer. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, trademark protection and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Veverimer was discovered by us utilizing our proprietary technology. We have filed several non-provisional and provisional patent applications, all owned by us, relating to veverimer in the United States, certain foreign countries, and the World Intellectual Property Organization that are directed to compositions-of-matter, dosage unit forms, methods-of-treatment, medical use, and methods of manufacture.
Our patent portfolio, which is solely owned by us, includes 229 patents issued through March 21, 2022 in 52 different countries, including three issued U.S. composition of matter patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,205,107 B2, 9,925,214 B2 and 10,934,380 B1), five issued U.S. method of treatment patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,993,500 B2, 10,391,118 B2, 10,363,268 B2,10,369,169 B1 and 11,266,684 B2), one issued U.S. method of manufacture patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,197,887 B2), two issued Australian medical use patents (AU 2014274817 B2 and 2019275584 B1), an issued Australian composition of matter patent (AU 2019219800 B1), one issued Australian method of manufacture patent (2015360413 B1), two issued European medical use patents (EP3 003 327 B1 and EP 3 578 185 B1), two issued European composition of matter patents (EP 3 287 133 B1 and EP 3 593 808 B1), an issued European method of manufacture patent (EP 3 229 816 B1), an issued Chinese composition of matter patent (ZL 2014 8 0032395.1), an issued Chinese method of manufacture patent (ZL 2015 8 0075741.9) an issued Mexican composition of matter patent (382077), an issued Mexican medical use patent (MX 364785 B), an issued Mexican method of manufacture patent (377154), issued Hong Kong medical use (HK 1223288 A1 and HK 40014989 A1), composition (HK 1222120 A1, HK 1251151 A1 and HK 40011585 A1) and method of manufacture (HK 1243952 A1) patents, an issued Israeli composition patent (271932), an issued Israeli medical use patent (IL 242758), an issued Israeli method of manufacture patent (252439), an issued Russian use (Swiss-type) and composition patent (RU 2728778), an issued Russian method of manufacture patent (RU 2713416), and issued Japanese medical use (JP 6,453,860 B2), composition of matter (JP 6759316 B2 and JP6921276 B2) and method of manufacture (JP6903576 B2) patents. Each of these issued patents is expected to expire in 2034 (with the exception of EP 3 229 816 B1, EP 3 593 808 B1, AU 2015360413 B1, CN ZL 2015 8 0075741.9, HK 1243952, HK 40011585, IL 252439, JP 6903576, JP 6921276, MX 377154, MX 382077 and RU 2713416, which are expected to expire in 2035 and U.S. Patent No. 10,934,380 B1, which is expected to expire in 2038), excluding any additional term resulting from patent term extension if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid.
In addition, we solely own other patent applications relating to veverimer (for example, composition of matter, dosage unit form, method-of-treatment, medical use and method of manufacture patent applications, where applicable) that are currently pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States. Certain of these patent applications are also pending in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. These currently pending patent applications, if they mature into issued patents in one or more of such jurisdictions, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid.
Additional patent term for the presently-issued or later-issued patents may be awarded on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. For example, additional patent term for U.S. patents may be awarded as a result of the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. In the European Union member countries, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum five years of market exclusivity. In Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license 
agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us.
Research and Development
We are conducting development activities to support our NDA for veverimer and manufacturing of commercial supply of veverimer. We incurred $115.4 million and $148.4 million of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than veverimer, or they may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
We are aware of FDA-approved therapies for slowing CKD progression, including sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT2i, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, or RAASi, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or MRAs; however, there are no therapies approved by the FDA for slowing CKD progression through the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis. We believe that the specific need to treat metabolic acidosis would preclude direct competition of these agents with veverimer. 
For many nephrologists, first-line management of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD is to recommend dietary changes to mitigate acid retention. And while kidney disease treatment guidelines recommend management of metabolic acidosis when serum bicarbonate levels fall below 22 mEq/L, retrospective analyses show that 3% to 15% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD use oral alkali supplementation, such as sodium bicarbonate. These supplements have not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis.
We are aware that AstraZeneca is conducting a clinical trial to explore the use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in patients with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis associated with chronic kidney disease. Because hyperkalemia is typically an acute condition that is not chronically treated, we do not believe that the use of an agent that reduces potassium levels episodically would create a serious competitive threat to a product that slows CKD progression through the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis. 
There are FDA-approved generic intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions for the treatment of acute metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and certain other disorders accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate; however, those therapies are used for short-term, hospital-based treatments and are not used in clinical practice to treat chronic metabolic acidosis.
Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drug products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, 
the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new product;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if conducted, of the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites;
•potential FDA inspection of us and vendors involved in the generation of the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate is usually into healthy human subjects, and the product candidate is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In most cases, the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 clinical trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances, including (1) where the clinical trial is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
A drug product candidate being studied in clinical trials may be made available for treatment of individual patients, in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational product for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational product.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to seek consultation from the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These interactions can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide feedback on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new product candidate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may identify necessary additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA if the product is a new molecular entity, or NME, or within ten months of submission for a non-NME; most applications for priority review product candidates are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA if the product is an NME and within six months of submission if it is a non-NME. Priority review can be applied to a product candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates, or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or complete response letter, or CRL. A CRL generally describes the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. When FDA issues a CRL, it must also provide the applicant with an opportunity to meet with the reviewing officials and discuss what further steps need to be taken by the applicant before the application can be approved. This meeting is known as the end-of-review conference. If a CRL is issued, the applicant has 12 months to select and implement one of the three following options: resubmit the NDA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of the NDA. The applicant’s failure to take any of these actions within the 12 months may be considered by the FDA to be a request by the applicant to withdraw the application. FDA will grant any reasonable request for an extension of time to resubmit the application. An applicant may also decide to submit a Formal Dispute Resolution Request, or FDRR, during this time.
The FDRR process offers sponsors, which includes NDA applicants, a mechanism for appealing scientific and/or medical disputes that cannot be resolved with the FDA. A CRL is a regulatory action that the FDA considers appropriate for formal dispute resolution. An FDRR must include information adequate to explain the nature of the scientific and/or medical dispute and to allow the deciding official to determine the necessary steps needed to resolve the matter quickly and efficiently. Because internal Agency review of a decision that has been appealed by a sponsor must be based on the same information as was relied on to make the original decision, the FDA has said in guidance that no new information should be submitted as part of an FDRR. The FDRR process begins with a request for reconsideration from the original deciding official, which is generally made as part of the end-of-review conference. Once reconsideration has been denied, the sponsor can escalate its appeal to the next higher management level in the FDA’s chain of command. An applicant can try to skip a level of review if the deciding official was involved in the CRL decision. FDA has 30 days to respond to an FDRR, and any subsequent appeal up the chain starts a new 30-day clock. The clock can be restarted by various actions by the Agency, e.g., grant of the applicant’s meeting request, issuance of an interim response, or request for clarifying information.
If, or when, the deficiencies identified in a CRL have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA also may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In addition, the FDA may require confirmatory postmarketing trials, sometimes 
referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Foreign Clinical Studies to Support an IND or NDA
The FDA may accept as support for an IND or NDA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial must submit supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP.
Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Accelerated Approval Program
Under the accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Products approved through the Accelerated Approval Program must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
Approval through the Accelerated Approval Program is subject, however, to the requirement that the applicant conduct additional confirmatory postmarketing clinical trials to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relationship of the surrogate endpoint to the clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical endpoint to ultimate outcome. Typically, clinical benefit is verified when confirmatory clinical trials show that the drug provides a clinically meaningful positive therapeutic effect, that is, an effect on how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The FDA may require that any confirmatory trial be initiated or substantially underway prior to the submission of an application through the Accelerated Approval Program.
Orange Book Listing, Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Orange Book Listing
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the FDA in timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. 
Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the reference listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the reference listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants generally do not need to include preclinical or clinical data to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Instead, ANDA applicants may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for the reference listed drug. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the reference listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution. 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent, which is called a Section VIII statement. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA-holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the “notice letter”). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information.
Patent Term Restoration
After approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension under the Hatch- Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase-the time between IND and NDA submission-and all of the review phase-the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years and only one patent may have a patent term extension.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the product candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a product candidate for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Market Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Postmarketing Requirements
After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs.
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•record-keeping requirements;
•reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product;
•providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
•therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements;
•notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
•registration and listing requirements; and
•complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved products, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements on NDA sponsors and third-party manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or take other judicial or administrative actions such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties, if a company fails to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements, if it encounters problems after initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 
In addition, drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and veverimer. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and anyone in a position to purchase or recommend the product on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, ordering or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA (discussed below).
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Additional information about the scope of these requirements and potential penalties is provided under “Risk Factors - We may be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or our potential involvement in enforcement activities, could have a material adverse effect on our results 
of operations and financial conditions” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, to the extent that veverimer may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We expect that veverimer, if approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, veverimer may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in these government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. There are penalties for failing to provide timely and accurate price reporting to the government, and the Right Rebate Act imposes additional penalties for knowingly misclassifying a covered outpatient drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to "Covered Recipients", or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, Covered Recipients and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The term Covered Recipients currently includes U.S.-licensed-physicians, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, 
exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of veverimer, if and when we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, commercial health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payers are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize veverimer successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for veverimer and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, veverimer, if approved.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for veverimer may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of veverimer, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Veverimer may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of veverimer on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to veverimer in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize veverimer.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products can only be effectively marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials in order to compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other Member States may allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross- border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of veverimer, if approved, for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to effectively sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, have undertaken efforts to contain healthcare costs, improve quality, and expand patient access to healthcare items and services. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the PPACA substantially changed and continues to impact healthcare financing and delivery by both government payers and private insurers. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for single source and innovator drugs at 100.0% of the product's AMP;
•the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, where as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D program, manufacturers must agree to offer 70.0% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans;
•expansion of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 138.0% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
•establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a separate methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives;
•a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
•a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
While the Biden Administration has recently signaled its intent to pursue policies strengthening the PPACA, there have been legal and judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Though Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Although two courts have ruled that this repeal renders the individual mandate unconstitutional, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the PPACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the law. Additionally, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2020 that repealed the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019; the annual fee imposed on certain third-party providers based on market share, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2020; and the medical device excise tax on nonexempt medical devices, for sales after December 31, 2019. In the future, there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA. It remains to be seen precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the cost of pharmaceutical products. 
We anticipate that the PPACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for veverimer, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, requires automatic reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs, of up to 2.0% per fiscal year. This sequestration took effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension by Congress for the period from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50.0% to 70.0% the point-of-sale discount to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative, administrative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation and regulations designed to, among other things, lower drug pricing, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer-sponsored patient support programs, and reform government program reimbursement 
methodologies for drugs. For example, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 were several drug price reporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor and the Treasury. Additionally, in December 2020, CMS issued a final regulation amending the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The rule implements changes to align existing regulations with statutory amendments enacted pursuant to the PPACA, and includes provisions affecting price reporting related to manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to PBM accumulator programs, certain value-based purchasing arrangements, line extensions, and authorized generics. Moreover, on July 9, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to promote competition in the U.S. economy that included several initiatives addressing prescription drugs. Among other provisions, the executive order directed the Secretary of HHS to issue a report to the White House within 45 days that includes a plan to, among other things, reduce prices for prescription drugs, including prices paid by the federal government for such drugs. In response to the Executive Order, on September 9, 2021, HHS issued a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that identified potential legislative policies and administrative tools that Congress and the agency can pursue in order to make drug prices more affordable and equitable, improve and promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry, and foster scientific innovation. 
 At the state level, legislatures and agencies are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including constraints on pricing, discounting and reimbursement; restrictions on certain product access and marketing; cost disclosure and transparency measures that require detailed reporting of drug pricing and marketing information both at product launch and in the event of a price increase; and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, the state of California passed legislation that requires drug manufacturers to notify the state at least 60 days prior to instituting price increases and Maryland passed legislation to create a drug pricing review commission that will evaluate drug cost and recommend setting an upper limit or cap for therapies deemed too expensive. We cannot predict what other reforms may ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation and, accordingly, face uncertainties that may result from additional reforms and their impact on our operations. Further, the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer, if approved.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing and any future commercial sales, promotion and distribution of veverimer. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market veverimer, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries.
Even if a product obtains FDA marketing approval, most foreign jurisdiction require that the investigational product undergo national requirements related to clinical trials and authorization processes, similar to those in the United States. With respect to clinical trials, certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, or the E.U., the Clinical Trials Regulation applied since January 31, 2022, replacing and repealing the Clinical Trials Directive. The Regulation requires, for example, that before starting a clinical trial, a valid request for authorization must be submitted by the sponsor via the E.U. Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS. Where the clinical trial takes place in several E.U. Member States, the application content and assessment are divided into two parts. Part I is assessed centrally by a reporting E.U. Member State and contains scientific and medicinal product documentation, the reporting Member State’s assessment is shared with the other concerned Member States. Part II is assessed by each concerned E.U. Member States and contains the national and patient-level documentation. A clinical trial can only start in an E.U. Member State once it has been authorized (potentially with conditions) by the concerned E.U. Member State via the CTIS. Under the Clinical Trials Regulation, national regulators in the E.U./EEA Member States must use CTIS to carry out their legal responsibilities in evaluating and overseeing clinical trials from January 31, 2022. During the transitional periods, the following applies: (a) until January 30, 2023, clinical trial sponsors may use CTIS to apply to run a clinical trial under the Clinical Trials Regulation or may choose to apply to run a trial under the Clinical Trials Directive; (b) from January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors will need to use CTIS to apply to start a new clinical trial in the E.U./EEA; and (c) from January 31, 2025, any trials approved under the Clinical Trials Directive that continue running will need to comply with the Clinical Trials Regulation and their sponsors must have recorded information on them in CTIS. Separately, the sponsor must obtain a positive opinion from the relevant, independent Ethics Committee(s). Failure to comply with applicable E.U. requirements may subject a company to the rejection of the request and the prohibition to start a clinical trial. Clinical trials conducted in the E.U. (or the data to be used to support a marketing authorization application in the E.U.) must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, GCP and GMP rules, International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines and be consistent with ethical principles. Competent authorities of E.U. Member States regularly conduct GCP inspections to verify the sponsor’s compliance with applicable rules. 
The sponsor is required to record all adverse events which are reported to it by investigators and submit, upon request, such records to the E.U. Member State in which the clinical trial is being conducted. The sponsor is also required, inter alia, to record and report electronically information about suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as soon as possible, and report yearly on all suspected serious adverse reactions having occurred over the past year and to report on the subjects' safety. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions may also be required to be reported to the relevant Ethics Committee(s).
The authorization of a clinical trial may be suspended or revoked by E.U. Member States in their respective territory if the conditions in the request for an authorization are no longer met, or if an E.U. Member State has information raising doubts about the safety or scientific validity of the clinical trial. If safety concerns related to our trials are identified, or if we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable E.U. regulatory requirements, our trials may be suspended or authorizations withdrawn. Various penalties exist in E.U. Member States for non-compliance with the clinical trial rules and related requirements, for example with respect to data protection and privacy. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable E.U. regulatory requirements, we may also be subject to damage compensation and civil and criminal liability.
Requirements to conduct a clinical trial in the United Kingdom are similar. Specifically, sponsors of clinical trials taking place in the United Kingdom must obtain authorization. The clinical trial must be registered in a public database (e.g., ISRCTN registry or ClinicalTrials.gov) and the sponsor must obtain a favorable opinion from a U.K. ethics committee. The United Kingdom recognizes ethics and regulatory approvals for clinical trials that were granted through the EU processes before December 31, 2020, but any trial commencing after January 1, 2021 must obtain U.K. authorization. Non-compliance with applicable requirements may equally result in the clinical trial authorization being suspended or revoked, and sponsor may be subject to civil and criminal liability.
As in the United States, no medicinal product may be placed on the E.U. and U.K. markets unless a marketing authorization has been issued. In the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or 
MHRA, assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products based on applications for marketing authorizations and grants an authorization if the risk-benefit balance is considered favorable. In the E.U., medicinal products may be authorized in different ways, depending on certain criteria: the national authorization procedure (i.e., via the E.U. Member States’ national authorization procedure, which later allows for application via the mutual-recognition procedure), the centralized authorization procedure (i.e., at E.U. level), or the decentralized authorization procedure (i.e., authorization of a product that is not yet authorized in the E.U., which can simultaneously be authorized in several E.U. Member States). Products submitted for approval via the national procedure must follow the national authorization procedures. Products submitted for approval via the centralized procedure (compulsory for certain products and indications; e.g., human medicines containing a new active substance to treat HIV or AIDS, advanced-therapy medicines, and orphan medicines, and optional for certain other products and indications) are assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a committee within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The CHMP assesses, inter alia, whether a medicine meets the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements and whether it has a positive risk-benefit balance. Products submitted for approval via the decentralized procedure, as for the mutual-recognition procedure, must first undergo an assessment performed by one Member State, or reference Member State, which another Member State may approve.
Various penalties and sanctions exist in different E.U. Member States for non-compliance with the E.U. marketing authorization procedure. In addition, for centrally authorized products the European Commission may also impose financial penalties on the holders of marketing authorizations if they fail to comply with certain obligations in connection with the authorizations as well as pharmacovigilance rules (a fine up to 5% of the marketing authorization holder’s turnover in the E.U. in the preceding business year for an infringement; daily penalty payments up to 2.5 % of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily turnover in the E.U. in the preceding business year, pending cessation of an infringement; and a fine up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s turnover in the E.U. in the preceding business year for e.g., failure to cooperate or supply of misleading information to authorities). If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable E.U. or other foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. Similar rules apply in the U.K. 
As described above, coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved, are provided for by the national laws of the E.U. Member States. The requirements may differ significantly across the E.U. Member States. In the E.U., pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from member state to member state. Some countries provide that products can only be effectively marketed after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies in order to compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. E.U. Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the E.U. have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the E.U. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
In December 2021, Regulation (E.U.) 2021/2282 on HTA, or HTA Regulation, was adopted. The HTA Regulation will apply from January 12, 2025. It practically replaces the current system based on the voluntary network of national authorities, and the new framework covers joint clinical assessments, joint scientific consultations, the identification of emerging health technologies, and voluntary cooperation for the national authorities. The HTA Regulation aims to provide a transparent and inclusive framework for health technology assessments in the E.U., and it will help E.U. countries determine the effectiveness and value of new technologies and decide on pricing and reimbursement by health insurers or health systems. Also, at E.U. Member State level, actions have been taken to enact transparency laws regarding payments between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals, or HCPs.
We are subject to European data protection laws, including the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or E.U. GDPR (as implemented by E.U. Member States). The E.U. GDPR which came into effect on May 25, 2018, 
establishes requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords various data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes potential penalties for serious breaches of up to 4.0% annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater. Individuals (e.g., study subjects) also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). The E.U. GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and additional mechanisms put in place to address compliance with the E.U. GDPR must be kept under review as the legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection in the E.U. continues to evolve.
Further, following the end of the Brexit Transition Period (on December 31, 2020) the E.U. GDPR has been implemented in the U.K. (as the U.K. GDPR)—non-compliance with which may lead to similar compliance and operational costs as the E.U. GDPR with potential fines of up to £17 million or 4% of global turnover. The U.K. GDPR sits alongside the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the E.U. GDPR into U.K. law.
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United Kingdom, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, privacy and data protection, pricing and reimbursement also vary from country to country.
